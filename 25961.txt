FOREWORD


   Dear Parents:--Don't imagine, please,
   It's in a boastful spirit
   I fashion verses such as these;
   That's not the truth or near it.

   A hundred or a thousand, yes,
   A million kids there may be
   Who aren't one iota less
   Attractive than this baby.

   I'll venture that your household has
   As valuable a treasure
   As mine, but mine I know, and as
   For yours, I've not that pleasure.

   And that is why my book's about
   Just one, O Dads and Mothers;
   But babes are babes, and mine, no doubt,
   Is very much like others.

GOOD-BY BILL


   Dollar Bill, that I've held so tight
   Ever since payday, a week ago,
   Shall I purchase with you tonight
   A pair of seats at the vaudeville show?
   (Hark! A voice from the easy chair:
   "Look at his shoes! We must buy a pair.")

   Dollar Bill, from the wreckage saved,
   Tell me, how shall I squander you?
   Shall I be shined, shampooed and shaved,
   Singed and trimmed 'round the edges, too?
   (Hark! A voice from the easy chair:
   "He hasn't a romper that's fit to wear.")

   Dollar Bill, that I cherished so,
   Think of the cigarettes you'd buy,
   Turkish ones, with a kick, you know;
   Makin's eventually tire a guy.
   (Hark! A voice from the easy chair:
   "Look at those stockings! Just one big tear!")

   Dollar Bill, it is time to part.
   What do I care for a vaudeville show?
   I'll shave myself and look just as smart.
   Makin's aren't so bad, you know.
   Dollar Bill, we must say good-by;
   There on the floor is the Reason Why.

A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM


   There's been a young stranger at our house,
   A baby whom nobody knew;
   Who hated his brother, his father, his mother,
   And made them aware of it, too.

   He stayed with us nearly a fortnight
   And carried a grouch all the while,
   Nor promise nor present could make him look pleasant;
   He hadn't the power to smile.

   He cried when he couldn't have something;
   He cried just as hard when he could;
   Kind words by the earful but made him more tearful,
   And scoldings did just as much good.

   He stormed when his meals weren't ready,
   And when they _were_ ready, he screamed.
   He went to bed growling, got up again howling
   And quarreled and snarled as he dreamed.

   He's gone, and the child we are fond of
   Is back, just as nice as of old.
   But I hope to be in some port European
   The next time he has a bad cold.

AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE


   My son, I wish that it were half
   As easy to extract a laugh
   From grown-ups as from thee.
   Then I'd go on the stage, my boy,
   While Richard Carle and Eddie Foy
   Burned up with jealousy.

   I wouldn't have to rack my brain
   Or lie awake all night in vain
   Pursuit of brand new jokes;
   Nor fear my lines were heard with groans
   Of pain and sympathetic moans
   From sympathetic folks.

   I'd merely have to make a face,
   Just twist a feature out of place,
   And be the soul of wit;
   Or bark, and then pretend to bite,
   And, from the screams of wild delight,
   Be sure I'd made a hit.

DISCIPLINE


   He couldn't have a doughnut, and it made him very mad;
   He undertook to get revenge by screaming at his dad.

   "Cut out that noise!" I ordered, and he gave another roar,
   And so I put him in "the room" and shut and locked the door.

   I left him in his prison cell two minutes, just about,
   And, penitent, he smiled at me when I did let him out.

   But when he got another look at the forbidden fruit
   He gave a yell that they could hear in Jacksonville or Butte.

   "Cut out that noise!" I barked again. "Cut out that foghorn stuff!
   Perhaps I didn't leave you in your prison long enough.

   "You want your dad to keep you jailed all afternoon, I guess."
   He smiled at me and answered his equivalent for "yes."

INEXPENSIVE GUESTS


   I wonder how 'twould make you feel,
     My fellow food providers,
   To have as guests at ev'ry meal
     Three--count 'em, three--outsiders.

   Well, that's the case with me, but still
     I don't complain or holler,
   For, strange to say, the groc'ry bill
     Has not gone up a dollar.

   These guests of ours, to make it brief,
     Can't really chew or swallow;
   They're merely dolls, called Indian Chief,
     And Funny Man, and Rollo.

HIS SENSE OF HUMOR


   Perhaps in some respects it's true
     That you resemble dad;
   To be informed I look like you
     Would never make me mad.
   But one thing I am sure of, son,
     You have a different line
   Of humor, your idea of fun
     Is not a bit like mine.

   You drop my slippers in the sink
     And leave them there to soak.
   That's very laughable, you think
     But I can't see the joke
   You take my hat outdoors with you
     And fill it full of earth;
   You seem to think that's witty, too,
     But I'm not moved to mirth.

   You open up the chicken-yard;
     Its inmates run a mile;
   You giggle, but I find it hard
     To force one-half a smile.
   No, kid, I fear your funny stuff,
     Though funny it may be,
   Is not quite delicate enough
     To make a hit with me.

SPEECH ECONOMY


   Since he began to talk and sing,
   I've learned one interesting thing--
   The value of a verb is small;
   In fact, it has no worth at all.

   Why waste the breath required to say,
   "While toddling through the park today,
   I saw a bird up in a tree,"
   When "Twee, pahk, birt," does splendidly?

   Why should one say, "Please pass the bread,"
   When "Ba-ba me" is easier said?
   And why "I'm starved. Have supper quick,"
   When "LUNCH!" yelled loudly, does the trick?

   Why "I've been riding on a train,"
   When "By-by, Choo-choo" makes it plain?
   "Let words be few," the poet saith,
   So leave out words and save your breath.

WELCOME TO SPRING


   Spring, you are welcome, for you are the friend of
   Fathers of all little girlies and chaps.
   Spring, you are welcome, for you mean the end of
   Bundling them up in their cold-weather wraps.

   Breathes there a parent of masculine gender,
   One whose young hopeful is seven or less,
   Who never has cursed the designer and vender
   Of juvenile-out-of-doors-winter-time dress?

   Leggings and overcoat, rubbers that squeeze on,
   Mittens and sweater a trifle too small;
   Not in the lot is one thing you can ease on,
   One that's affixed with no trouble at all.

   Spring, you are welcome, thrice welcome to father;
   Not for your flowers and birds, I'm afraid,
   As much as your promised relief from the bother
   Of bundling the kid for the daily parade.

[Illustration]

TASTE


   I can't understand why you pass up the toys
   That Santa considered just right for small boys;
   I can't understand why you turn up your nose
   At dogs, hobby-horses, and treasures like those,
   And play a whole hour, sometimes longer than that,
   With a thing as prosaic as daddy's old hat.

   The tables and shelves have been loaded for you
   With volumes of pictures--they're pretty ones, too--
   Of birds, beasts, and fishes, and old Mother Goose
   Repines in a corner and feels like the deuce,
   While you, on the floor, quite contentedly look
   At page after page of the telephone book.

RIDDLES


   If it's fun to take books from the bookcase,
     If you really believe it's worth while
   To carry them out to the kitchen
     And build them all up in a pile,
   Why isn't it just as agreeable then
   To carry them back to the bookcase again?

   If it's fun to make marks with a pencil
     In books that one cares for a heap;
   To tear out the pages from volumes
     One likes and is anxious to keep,
   Why isn't it pleasure to put on the hummer
   A magazine read and discarded last summer?

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




HESITATION


   I've orders to waken you from your nap,
   And orders are orders, my little chap.
   But I hate to do it, because it seems
   A shame to break in on your blissful dreams.

   I've sat and watched you a long, long while,
   And not since I came have you ceased to smile.
   So it strikes me as wrong to arouse you, boy,
   From sleep that's so plainly a sleep of joy.

   'Twill make a big diff'rence tonight, of course,
   But p'rhaps you are riding a real live horse;
   In dreams, it's a pleasant and harmless sport,
   So why should I cruelly cut it short?

   Maybe you have for your very own
   A piece of pie or an ice cream cone;
   If that's your amusement, why end it quick?
   Dream-food can't possibly make you sick.

   Orders are orders and I'm afraid
   It's trouble for me if they're disobeyed.
   But I'll bet if the boss could see you, son,
   She'd put off the duty, as I have done.

HIS WONDERFUL CHOO-CHOOS


   When I see his wonderful choo-choo trains,
   Which he daily builds with infinite pains,
   Whose cars are a crazy and curious lot--
   A doll, a picture, a pepper pot,
   A hat, a pillow, a horse, a book,
   A pote, a mintie, a button hook,
   A bag of tobacco, a piece of string,
   A pair of wubbas, a bodkin ring,
   A deck of twos and a paper box,
   A brush, a comb and a lot of blocks--
   When I first gaze on his wonderful trains,
   Which he daily builds with infinite pains,
   I laugh, and I think to myself, "O gee!
   Was ever a child as cute as he?"

   But when he's gone to his cozy nest,
   From the toil of his strenuous day to rest,
   And when I gaze on his trains once more,
   Where they lie, abandoned, across the floor,
   And when the terrible task I face
   Of putting each "Pullman" back in its place,
   I groan a little, and think, "O gee!
   Was ever a child as mean as he?"


GLOSSARY

   Bodkin--A napkin
   Mintie--A mitten.
   Pote--A pencil.

COUSINLY AFFECTION


   Why do you love your Cousin Paull?
   For his sweet face, his smile, and all
   The little tricks that charm us so?
   You're not quite old enough to know
   How cute he is; to realize
   How clever for a child his size.
   I'm sure you can't appreciate
   The things that make us think him great.

   And yet you love your Cousin Paull.
   Is it because he's twice as small
   As you, just right for you to maul?
   Because he won't fight back, or bawl?
   Because when he is pushed he'll fall?
   And, where most kids would howl and squall,
   He takes it, nor puts in a call
   For mother? Am I warm at all?
   Is this why you love Cousin Paull?

MY BABY'S GARDEN


   My baby has a garden,
   "Planted" four days ago,
   And nearly half his waking hours
   He spends among his precious flowers
   With sprinkling can and hoe.

   My baby has a garden,
   And Oh, how proud he is
   When, yielding to his pleading, we
   Lay work aside and go to see
   This masterpiece of his!

   Behold my baby's garden,
   Close by a rubbish pile!
   Look at the sprinkling can and hoe
   And flowers; then tell me if you know
   Whether to sigh or smile.

   The flowers in baby's garden,
   Flat on the ground they lie,
   Two hyacinths, a withered pair,
   Plucked from the pile of rubbish, where
   They had been left to die.

   The flowers in baby's garden,
   "Planted" four days ago,
   Grow every hour a sadder sight,
   Weaker and sicklier, in spite
   Of sprinkling can and hoe.

DECISION REVERSED


   When I mixed with the shoppers and fought in vain
     To get what I sought, in the Christmas rush;
   When they stood on my toes in the crowded train,
     Or dented my ribs in the sidewalk crush,
   I dropped my manners and snarled and swore,
   And thought: "It's a bothersome, beastly bore!"

   But when, at the Christmas dawn, they brought
     My kid to the room where his things were piled,
   And when, from my vantage point, I caught
     The look on his face, I murmured: "Child,
   Your dad was a fool when he snarled and swore,
   And called it a bothersome, beastly bore."

THE GROCERY MAN AND THE BEAR


   He was weary of all of his usual joys;
     His books and his blocks made him tired,
   And so did his games and mechanical toys,
     And the songs he had always admired;
   So I told him a story, a story so new
     It had never been heard anywhere;
   A tale disconnected, unlikely, untrue,
     Called The Grocery Man and the Bear.

   I didn't think much of the story despite
     The fact 'twas a child of my brain.
   And I never dreamt, when I told it that night,
     That I'd have to tell it again;
   I never imagined 'twould make such a hit
     With the audience of one that was there
   That for hours at a time he would quietly sit
     Through The Grocery Man and the Bear.

   To all other stories, this one is preferred;
     It's the season's best seller by far,
   And out at our house it's as frequently heard
     As cuss-words in Mexico are.
   When choo-choos and horses and picture books fail,
     He'll remain, quite content, in his chair,
   While I tell o'er and o'er the incredible tale
     Of The Grocery Man and the Bear.

COMING HOME


   Prepare for noise, you quiet walls!
   You floors, get set for heavy falls!
     Frail dishes, hide away!
   Get ready for some scratches, stairs!
   Clean table linen, say your prayers!
     The kid comes home today!

   For three long weeks you've been, O House,
   As noiseless as the well-known mouse,
     As silent as the tomb.
   And you've stayed neat, with none on hand
   To track your floors with mud and sand,
     To muss your ev'ry room.

   The ideal place for work you've been,
   But soon a Bedlam once again,
     A mess, a wreck. But say,
   I wonder will it make us mad.
   No, House, I'll bet we both are glad
     The kid comes home today.

HIS IMAGINATION


   One thing that's yours, my little child
   Your poor old dad is simply wild
   To own. It's not a book or toy;
   It's your imagination, boy.
   If I possessed it, what a time
   I'd have, nor need to spend a dime!

   I wish that I could get astride
   A broom, and have a horse to ride;
   Or climb into the swing, and be
   A sailor on the deep blue sea,
   Or b'lieve a chair a choo-choo train,
   Bound anywhere and back again.

   If I could ride as fast and far
   On ship or horse, in train or car,
   As you, at small expense or none,
   If I could have one-half your fun
   And do the things that you do, free,
   I'd give them back my salary.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




HIS MEMORY


   Besides my little son's imagination,
   Another thing he has appeals to me
   And agitates my envious admiration--
   It's his accommodating memory.

   An instant after some unlucky stumble
   Has floored him and induced a howl of pain,
   He's clean forgotten all about his tumble
   And violently sets out to romp again.

   But if, when I leave home, I say that maybe
   I'll get him something nice while I'm away,
   It's very safe to bet that Mr. Baby
   Will not forget, though I be gone all day.

   Ah, would I might lose sight of things unpleasant:
   The bills I owe; the work I haven't done.
   And only think of future joys and present,
   Like the approaching payday, and my son.

CONFESSION


   A sleuth like Pinkerton or Burns
   Is told that there has been a crime.
   He runs down clues and leads, and learns
   Who did the deed, in course of time.
   It's just the other way with me:
   The first thing I am sure of is
   The criminal's identity,
   And then I learn what crime was his.

   When Son comes up with hanging head
   And smiles a certain kind of smile,
   When he's affectionate instead
   Of playful; when he stalls awhile
   And starts to speak and stops again,
   Or, squirming like a mouse that's caught,
   Asserts, "I am a GOOD boy," then
   I look to see what harm's been wrought.

HIS LADY FRIEND


   Who is Sylvia? What is she
     That early every morning
   You desert your family
     And rush to see her, scorning
   Your once cherished ma and me?

   Are her playthings such a treat?
     I will steal 'em from her;
   Better that than not to meet
     My son and heir all summer,
   Save when he comes home to eat.

   Or is she herself the one
     And only real attraction?
   Has your little heart begun
     To get that sort of action?
   Better wait a few years, son.

[Illustration]

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE


   "MYSELF!" It means that you don't care
   To have me lift you in your chair;
   That if I do, you'll rage and tear.

   "MYSELF!" It means you don't require
   Assistance from your willing sire
   In eating; 'twill but rouse your ire.

   "MYSELF!" It means when you are through
   That you don't want your daddy to
   Unseat you, as he used to do.

   Time was, and not so long ago,
   When you were carried to and fro
   And waited on, but now? No! No!

   You'd rather fall and break your head,
   Or fill your lap with cream and bread
   Than be helped up or down, or fed.

   Well, kid, I hope you'll stay that way
   And that there'll never come a day
   When you're without the strength to say,
   "MYSELF!"

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE ETERNAL GREETING


   What is the welcoming word I hear
   When I reach home at the close of day?
   "Glad you are with us, daddy, dear?"
   Something I'd like to hear you say?
   No, it is this, invariably:
   "Daddy, what have you got for me?"

   "Deep affection," I might reply;
   What would it profit if I did?
   I might answer: "The price to buy
   Clothes and edibles for you, kid."
   You would repeat, insistently:
   "Daddy, what have you got for me?"

   Isn't my Self enough for you?
   Doesn't my Presence satisfy?
   No, that spelling would never do;
   You want Presents, a new supply,
   When you inquire so eagerly:
   "Daddy, what have you got for me?"

   'Twould be much nicer and cheaper, son,
   If I were welcome without a toy,
   But as I'm not, I must purchase one
   And take my reward from your look of joy
   When you open the bundle and cry: "O, see!
   See what daddy has got for me!"

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




GUESS AGAIN


   "I guess I'll help you, daddy."
     And daddy can't say "No;"
   For if he did, 'twould wound you, kid,
     And cause the tears to flow.

   "I guess I'll help you, daddy."
     And daddy says: "All right,"
   And tries to do, ignoring you,
     Whatever work's in sight.

   But what's the use of trying?
     As well be reconciled
   To quit and play the game that may
     Be pleasing to you, child.

   To quit and play, or roughhouse,
     Or read, as you elect;
   For I'm afraid the guess you made
     Was wholly incorrect.

NEARLY A SINECURE


   "I'm going to the office."
     So says my youngster, and
   Gets on the train to take him there
   (The train's the sofa or a chair,
     Whichever's near at hand.)

   "Now I am to the office.
     I'm working now," says he,
   And just continues standing there
   On that same lounge or that same chair,
     As idle as can be.

   Perhaps four seconds after
     He first got on his train,
   I see him getting off once more.
   He steps or falls onto the floor
     And says, "I'm home again."

   I don't know what they pay him,
     Nor where the office is.
   The nature of the boy's posish
   I've never learned--but how I wish
     I had that job of his!

THE HECKUSES


   That may not be the proper way
   To spell their name; I cannot say.
   I've never seen 'em written out:
   I've only heard 'em talked about.
   They're coming here tonight to dine,
   So says that little son of mine.
   But all last week, 'twas just the same;
   They were to come, and never came.

   And I'm just skeptical enough
   To think they're all a myth, a bluff;
   Mere creatures of my youngster's brain,
   Whose coming he'll await in vain.
   And yet to him they're very real.
   They own a big black auto'bile.
   They work downtown, and they'll arrive
   Out here at one-two-three-four-five.

   The Heckuses are four all told.
   There's Mrs. H. who's very old,
   And Baby Heckus, and a lad
   Named Tom, and Bill, the Heckus dad.
   Beyond this point I can't describe
   The fascinating Heckus tribe.
   I can but wonder how he came
   To think of such a lovely name.

HIS FAVORITE ROLE


   You could be president as well as not,
     Since all you'd have to do is think you were,
   With that imagination that you've got;
     Or multimillionaire if you prefer,
   Or you could be some famous football star,
     Or Tyrus Cobb, admired by ev'ry fan;
   Instead of that, you tell me that you are
     The Garbage Man.

   Why pick him out, when you can take your choice?
     Is his so charming, nice, and sweet a role
   That acting it should make you to rejoice
     And be a source of comfort to your soul?
   Is there some hidden happiness that he
     Uncovers in his march from can to can
   That you above all else should want to be
     The Garbage Man?

THE PATHS OF RASHNESS


   Up to the sky the birdman flew
   And looped some loops that were bold and new.
   The people marvelled at nerve so great
   And gasped or cheered as he tempted fate,
   More daring each day than the day before,
   Till the birdman fell and arose no more.

   The bandit bragged of his daylight crimes
   And said: "I'm the wonder of modern times."
   Bolder and bolder his thefts became,
   And the people shook when they heard his name.
   He boasted: "I'm one that they'll never get."
   But he jollied himself into Joliet.

   Well, son, I suppose you would be admired
   For the valorous habit that you've acquired
   Of rushing at each little girl you meet
   And hugging her tight in the public street.
   But the day will come, I have not a doubt,
   When you'll stagger home with an eye scratched out.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE NEW PLAYTHING


   I wonder what your thought will be
   And what you'll say and do, sir,
   When you come home again and see
   What Daddy's got for you, sir.

   I wonder if you'll like it, boy,
   Or turn away disgusted
   (You've often scorned a nice, new toy
   For one that's old and busted.)

   I wonder if you'll laugh, or cry
   And run in fright to mother,
   Or just act bored to death, when I
   Show you your brand new brother.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
