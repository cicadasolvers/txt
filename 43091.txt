Normandy, claimed the crown, on the pretext that Edward had bequeathed it
to him, and landed with an army at Pevensey to assert his claim.

=HAROLD DEFEATED AND SLAIN AT HASTINGS= (Oct. 14).

    The battle of Hastings was one of the "few battles of which a contrary
    event would have essentially varied the drama of the world in all its
    subsequent scenes."




THE NORMAN LINE.


WILLIAM I., surnamed THE CONQUEROR.

=D.= He was the son of Robert, duke of Normandy. =B.= at Falaise, 1027.
=M.= Matilda, daughter of Baldwin V., count of Flanders. =Dd.= at Rouen,
Sept. 9, 1087. =R.= 21 years (1066 to 1087).[1]

    [1] =D.=, descent; =B.=, born; =M.=, married; =Dd.=, died; =R.=
    reigned.

1067. William visited Normandy, and during his absence the tyranny of his
regents goaded some of the people into insurrection.

1068. The king marched to Exeter, and captured it after a short siege.
Later in the year he carried his arms to York.

1069. An armament, commanded by Harold and Canute, sons of Sweyn, king of
Denmark, arrived in the Humber. The invaders were joined by Edgar Atheling
(the grandson of Edmund Ironside, and heir to the throne on the death of
Edward the Confessor), Waltheof (the son of Siward), and other Saxon
nobles. William is said to have bought off the hostility of the Danes. He
captured York, which had fallen into the hands of the insurgents, and
ordered the whole district, from the Humber to the Tees, to be laid
waste,--an order most effectually and cruelly carried out.

1070. Waltheof was made earl of Huntingdon, and received the hand of
William's niece, Judith, in marriage.

king for some time in the Isle of Ely, surrendered. CONQUEST OF ENGLAND
COMPLETED.

1072. William invaded Scotland, and compelled Malcolm to acknowledge
himself a vassal of the English crown.

1074. The earls of Hereford and Norfolk, and Waltheof, conspired against
the king. Waltheof revealed the plot, and sought the king's pardon, but
was executed the next year at Winchester.

1079. The king besieged the castle of GERBEROI, held by his son Robert,
who had rebelled against him. Robert, not recognizing his father, wounded
and unhorsed him.

About this time the New Forest was formed.

1085. _FEUDAL SYSTEM ESTABLISHED IN ENGLAND._

    It is generally believed that the system of feudal tenures was legally
    established in England at the Council of Salisbury, held either in
    1085 or 1086. The great characteristic of the feudal system was that
    the obligation of military or knight's service was annexed to the
    tenure of land held of the sovereign. The estates, or fiefs of the
    tenants-in-chief, consisted of one or more knight's fees; and for
    every fee the king might claim the military service of an armed knight
    for forty days a year. The holders of these estates, on taking
    possession, were required to do homage, and to swear fealty to the
    king; and on particular and specified occasions other services were
    exacted. The holders of large estates often granted portions of their
    land to under-vassals, from whom they received services similar to
    those which they themselves rendered to their sovereign. The number of
    knight's fees in England was 60,215.

About this time _the ecclesiastical was separated from the civil
jurisdiction_; all causes of the Church were to be tried before clerical
tribunals.

1086. =Domesday Book completed.=

    This invaluable record, the result of a survey begun about the year
    1080, consists of two volumes, and contains an account of the extent
    and value of the landed property of the country, together with many
    other important particulars.

1087. William engaged in war with Philip I. of France. He was seriously
hurt at Mantes, and the injury terminated fatally.

In this reign the mode of _trial by combat_ began to be employed. The
curfew-bell was tolled every night at eight o'clock, at which time all
fires were to be put out.


WILLIAM II., surnamed RUFUS.

=D.= He was the son of William I. =B.= about 1060. =Killed= in the New
Forest, Aug. 2, 1100, =R.= 13 years (1087 to 1100).

1088. Several of the principal Norman nobles conspired against the king.
The insurrection suppressed by the aid of the Saxons.

1090. William intrigued against his elder brother Robert, duke of
Normandy, in the hope of acquiring the duchy.

1091. William invaded Normandy. A treaty concluded between the brothers,
by which the king obtained several towns in the duchy. Malcolm III., king
of Scotland, invaded England, but was repulsed.

1093. Malcolm invaded England, and was slain at ALNWICK.

1095. =Urban II. preached the first Crusade at Clermont in Auvergne=, and
induced several of the princes of Europe to take part in the enterprise.

    The object of the Crusades was to recover Jerusalem and the Holy Land
    from the Turks, who treated the Christian pilgrims with great
    harshness and cruelty. These wars lasted about 174 years, and
    exercised great political influence on the Continent. The only Crusade
    in which the English played an important part was that undertaken by
    Richard I.

1096. Robert mortgaged his duchy to William, in order that he might join
the Crusade.

1097. William built a wall round the Tower, a bridge over the Thames, and
a great hall at Westminster.

1098. Magnus, king of Norway, made a descent on the Isle of Anglesea, but
was repulsed. =This was the last attempt made by the Northmen upon
England.=

1100. It is said that the Goodwin Sands were formed this year by an
inundation of the sea, which overflowed 4,000 acres of land, off the coast

=M.= (1) Matilda, daughter of Malcolm III. of Scotland, and of Margaret,

(1100 to 1135).

assert his claim to the crown. He renounced his pretensions on condition
of receiving 3,000 marks a year.

and took him prisoner. =He annexed the duchy to the kingdom.=

of Flanders and Anjou, tried to recover Normandy.

(widow of Henry V., emperor of Germany, and wife of Geoffrey Plantagenet,
earl of Anjou), usurped by Stephen.

1138. David I. of Scotland invaded England to support the cause of his
niece Matilda. He was defeated at NORTHALLERTON (Aug. 22). This battle
generally called the Battle of the Standard.

1139. Peace concluded with Scotland. Matilda, accompanied by her natural
brother, Robert of Gloucester, invaded England. =Civil war, which lasted
for several years, and enabled the nobles to plunder and oppress the
people.=

    country without the king's consent;--that no appeals should be made to
    Rome without his consent;--that no tenant-in-chief, or officer of his
    household, should be excommunicated without his consent;--that the
    king should enjoy the revenues of vacant sees;--and that no prelate
    should be elected without his assent.

1165. Henry invaded Wales a second time, and defeated the Welsh on the
banks of the CIEROC, in Denbighshire.

1169. Richard Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, and other knights, aided Dermot

1170. Henry and Becket were reconciled. =Becket= returned to England, and
=was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral= (Dec. 29).

1171. =Henry invaded Ireland, and was acknowledged lord of the country.=

    In the second year of his reign (1155) he had obtained a bull from
    Pope Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman who ever sat
    on the papal throne), authorizing him to subject the people of that
    country, but hitherto other affairs had prevented him from undertaking
    the enterprise.

1173. Three of Henry's sons rebelled against him, and were aided by the
kings of France and Scotland.

1174. William, king of Scotland, invaded the country, and was defeated and
taken prisoner at ALNWICK (July 12). Henry did penance at the tomb of
Becket. William released on agreeing to a treaty by which Scotland was
declared a vassal dependency of England.

1176. England divided into six circuits, and _ITINERANT JUSTICES APPOINTED

1187. Richard revolted against his father, and joined Philip II. of
France. =Saladin captured Jerusalem.=

1189. Peace concluded between Henry and Philip at Tours; the terms
unfavourable to Henry.

In this reign _the common law of England probably originated_.


RICHARD I., surnamed COEUR DE LION.

=D.= He was the eldest surviving son of Henry II. =B.= at Oxford, 1157.
=M.= Berengaria, daughter of Sancho, king of Navarre. =Mortally wounded=
while besieging the castle of Chaluz; he died April 6, 1199. =R.= 9-1/2

1189. Massacre of the Jews in London, and the next year at Lincoln,
Norwich, York, and other towns.

1190. The king set out for Palestine to take part in the third Crusade for
the recovery of Jerusalem. He joined Philip at Messina.

besieged for nearly two years. Philip returned to France. Battle of
ARSOOF, in which Richard defeated Saladin.

1192. Richard concluded a truce with Saladin, and left Palestine. He was
taken prisoner in passing through Austria.

1194. Richard released on paying a heavy ransom. He engaged in war with

the English crown.

1196. An insurrection broke out in London under William FitsOsbert.

1198. Richard defeated Philip of France at GISORS.

    In this reign lived the famous outlaw Robin Hood, sometimes called
    earl of Huntingdon.


JOHN, surnamed LACKLAND.

=D.= He was the brother of Richard. =B.= at Oxford, 1166. =M.= (1)
Hadwisa, heiress of the earl of Gloucester, from whom he was divorced; (2)
Isabella, daughter of the count of Angouleme. =Dd.= at Newark, Oct. 19,
1216. =R.= 17-1/2 years (1199 to 1216).

recognized as Richard's successor in Anjou, Maine, and Touraine.

1202. Arthur besieged his grandmother, Queen Eleanor, in the castle of
MIRABEAU. John raised the siege, and captured his nephew, whom he is
supposed to have murdered.

1203. John, being summoned by Philip II. of France, his lord superior, to
answer for the death of Arthur, refused to attend his court, and was
declared to have forfeited all his lands in France.

1204. =Philip II. conquered Normandy.= Before the close of the next year,
all the English possessions except Aquitaine fell into the hands of the
French.

1205. Death of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury.

1206. John invaded France, and after some successes consented to a two
years' truce.

1207. =Stephen Langton appointed archbishop of Canterbury by the pope.=
This led to a serious quarrel between the king and pope, as the former
refused to recognize the archbishop.

1208. The king granted the citizens of London liberty to appoint a mayor
every year. The pope laid England under an interdict.

    The object of the interdict was to induce John to acknowledge the
    archbishop. When a country was laid under an interdict the churches
    were closed, no bells tolled, and all public ecclesiastical functions
    ceased, except confession, the baptism of infants, and the sacrament
    of the dying. The bodies of the dead lay unburied, or were interred in
    unconsecrated ground without any prayer or service of the priest.

1209. John excommunicated by the pope.

1210. He invaded Ireland, and 20 chieftains repaired to his court, and did
homage. The next year he invaded Wales, and dictated terms of submission
to Llewellyn, the Welsh chief.

1212. The pope deposed John, and offered the crown to Philip II., who
began to make active preparations for an invasion.

1213. The English crossed the channel, captured some French ships, and
burnt Dieppe. John surrendered the kingdom to the pope, and received it
back as his vassal.

1214. Philip defeated an allied English, German, and Flemish army at
BOUVINES, in Flanders (July 27).

1215. The English barons, unable to bear any longer the arbitrary and
tyrannical government of the king, took up arms against him, and compelled
him to grant a charter, known as _MAGNA CHARTA_. The pope annulled the
charter; and the king, refusing to abide by it, collected foreign
mercenaries, and ravaged the lands of the barons.

    Magna Charta (or the Great Charter), is justly recognized as the
    keystone of English liberty. It contained 63 clauses, among the most
    important of which were that no freeman should be dispossessed of his
    property, imprisoned, or outlawed contrary to law;--that justice
    should not be sold, delayed, or refused to any one;--that no one
    should be fined except by his peers, and in proportion to his
    fault;--that no taxes save certain therein specified should be granted
    except by parliament;--that justices should go through each county
    four times a year to try causes;--that weights and measures should be
    justly fixed;--and that merchants should have liberty to enter and
    leave the country, except in time of war.

WITH THE GRANT OF MAGNA CHARTA COMMENCES THE HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH
NATION.

1216. The confederated barons offered the crown to Louis (son of Philip
II., and husband of John's niece). He accepted their offer, and landed in
England.


HENRY III., of WINCHESTER.

=D.= He was the eldest son of John. =B.= at Winchester, 1207. =M.=
Eleanor, daughter of Raymond Berenger, count of Provence. =Dd.= at
Westminster, Nov. 16, 1272. =R.= 56 years (1216 to 1272).

1216. The king being only nine years old, the earl of Pembroke was
appointed regent.

1217. Louis' army defeated at LINCOLN (May 20). Hubert vanquished and
nearly destroyed a fleet sent to assist Louis, who now finding his cause
hopeless, returned to France.

1219. Death of Pembroke. His authority shared between Hubert de Burgh and
Peter des Roches: the latter retired from office in 1224.

1225. The Great Charter confirmed and ratified in the form it has ever
since retained.

    The chapters relative to forests and warrens had been withdrawn from
    the charter a few years before, and, with certain modifications,
    formed into a separate charter, called the Charter of Forests, which
    was now confirmed.

1232. Hubert de Burgh removed from office, and succeeded by his old rival,
Peter des Roches.

1242. Henry invaded France, and was defeated by Louis IX. at TAILLEBOURG
in Saintonge.

1258. The king's misgovernment, which had lasted through a series of
years, led the nobility, headed by Simon de Montfort (earl of Leicester,
and brother-in-law of the king), to endeavour to check his arbitrary
power; and at a parliament held at Oxford, unjustly called THE MAD
PARLIAMENT, =they drew up some ordinances for the reformation of the
Government, known as= THE PROVISIONS OF OXFORD.

    Two of the most important provisions were, that four knights should be
    chosen by the freeholders of each county to ascertain and lay before
    parliament all wrongs committed by the royal officers, and that
    parliaments should meet thrice in the year.

1259. Henry formally renounced all claim to the English possessions in
France lost in John's reign, and Louis IX. ceded to him Limousin, Querci,
and Perigord.

1261. Henry refused to abide by the Provisions of Oxford, and tried,
though without success, to recover his authority by forcible means.

1264. THE BARONS' WAR. The barons, led by Simon de Montfort, resorted to
arms, and defeated Henry at LEWES (May 14). He and his brother Richard
taken prisoners.

    The next day a treaty, called the ~Mise of Lewes~, was concluded, by
    which it was agreed that Prince Edward and his cousin Henry should be
    kept as hostages for their fathers, and that all matters that could
    not be amicably settled in the next parliament should be referred to
    arbitration. Simon de Montfort, in the king's name, summoned a
    parliament to meet early in the following year.

1265. _ORIGIN Of POPULAR REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT._ The first
parliament, to which representatives for cities and boroughs were
summoned, met at Westminster. The royalists, under Prince Edward, who had
escaped from his keepers, overthrew the barons at EVESHAM (Aug. 4). Simon
de Montfort fell in the battle.

1270. The country being restored to tranquillity, Prince Edward took the
cross, and set sail for the Holy Land.


EDWARD I., surnamed LONGSHANKS.

=D.= He was the eldest son of Henry III. =B.= at Westminster, 1239. =M.=
(1) Eleanor, daughter of Ferdinand III., king of Castile; (2) Margaret,
daughter of Philip III. of France. =Dd.= at Burgh-on-the-Sands, near
Carlisle, July 7, 1307. =R.= 34-1/2 years (1272 to 1307).

1274. Edward returned to England.

1277. He invaded Wales, and compelled Llewellyn to submit to very
humiliating terms.

1279. _Statute of Mortmain_ passed; all lands granted to the church
without the king's licence were to be forfeited.

1282. Insurrection in Wales. Llewellyn surprised and slain in the valley
of the Wye, near BUILTH (Dec. 11).

=CONQUEST OF WALES.=

1283. David, brother of Llewellyn, executed for high treason.

1284. Wales formally annexed to England by the Statute of Wales, enacted
at Rhuddlan. Prince Edward born at CAERNARVON. He was afterwards declared
prince of Wales.

1290. The Jews, 15,000 in number, expelled from the kingdom.

1291. Edward, having been called in to decide the claims of several
competitors for the Scottish crown, required the nobles and competitors to
acknowledge him feudal lord of Scotland.

1292. He conferred the crown on John Baliol, who had indisputably the best
claim.--Death of Roger Bacon, a Franciscan friar, a famous experimental
philosopher, and the inventor of the magnifying glass.

1294. Quarrel with France. Philip by an artifice obtained possession of
Guienne. The duchy was restored in 1303.

1296. =WAR WITH SCOTLAND.= Baliol revolted against Edward. The latter
invaded Scotland, and captured Berwick. The earl of Surrey gained a great
victory over the Scots at DUNBAR (April 27). Baliol made his submission,
and was sent to the Tower.

1297. The clergy, who had been very heavily taxed in this reign, on
refusing a new demand, were outlawed by the king, and their property was
seized for his benefit. To recover it, they were compelled to make a large
payment. The Scots, under Sir William Wallace, utterly routed the English
at CAMBUSKENNETH, near Stirling (Sept. 10). A statute called _Confirmatio
Chartarum_ enacted, by which the Great Charter, and the Charter of
Forests, were solemnly confirmed.

    These charters were to be read in cathedral churches twice a year;
    excommunication was pronounced against the breakers of the charters;
    and no new taxes were to be levied except by consent of parliament.

1298. Edward invaded Scotland, and completely defeated Wallace at FALKIRK
(July 22).

1303. Battle of ROSLIN (Feb. 24), in which the advantage lay with the
Scots.

1304. Surrender of Stirling Castle. =Conquest of Scotland completed.=

1305. Wallace captured, and executed as a traitor.

1306. Robert Bruce, grandson of one of the competitors for the Scottish
crown, assumed the title of king. He was defeated at METHVEN (June 19),
and escaped to the Western Isles.

1307. Bruce emerged from his retreat at Rathlin, and defeated the English
at LOUDON HILL (May 10). Edward determined to punish the Scots, and
marched northward, but his intention was frustrated by death.


EDWARD II., of CAERNARVON.

=D.= He was the son of Edward I. =B.= at Caernarvon, 1284. =M.= Isabella,
daughter of Philip IV. of France. Deposed, Jan. 20, 1327. =Murdered= in
Berkeley Castle, Sept., 1327. =R.= 19-1/2 years (1307 to 1327).

1308. The nobles compelled the king to banish his favourite, Piers
Gaveston.

1309. Having succeeded in mitigating the hostility of the barons, he
recalled his favourite, who had been governor of Ireland during his
absence from England.

1310. A parliament, assembled at Westminster, obtained the king's
reluctant consent to the appointment of a committee of peers called
_ordainers_, who were to draw up ordinances for the reformation of the
state, and the regulation of the king's household.

1311. The ordinances were drawn up and accepted by the king.

    Among the ordinances were the following:--that Gaveston should be
    banished for ever;--that the new taxes on wool, cloth, and wine should
    be abolished;--that the king should not leave the kingdom, nor
    undertake war, without the consent of the _baronage_ in
    Parliament;--that all the great officers of the crown should be chosen
    with their assent;--and that parliaments should be held once a year,
    or twice if need be.

1312. Gaveston, who had retired to Flanders, returned. He was seized and
executed on Blacklow Hill, near Warwick. Suppression of the order of
Knights Templars.

1314. Edward invaded Scotland. =Bruce gained a splendid victory at=
BANNOCKBURN (June 24). INDEPENDENCE OF SCOTLAND RE-ESTABLISHED.

1322. The earl of Lancaster, a prince of the blood, who had risen against
the king and his second favourite, De Spenser, defeated at BOROUGHBRIDGE,
in Yorkshire (March 16), and executed at Pomfret.

1327. Edward deposed by the influence of the queen and her favourite,
Roger Mortimer.

In this reign the assumption prevailed that no important business could be
transacted without the sanction of parliament; and the House of Commons
began the practice of coupling the grant of supplies with the redress of
grievances.


EDWARD III., of WINDSOR.

=D.= He was the son of Edward II. =B.= at Windsor, 1312. =M.= Philippa,
daughter of William, count of Hainault. =Dd.= at Shene (Richmond), June
21, 1377. =R.= 50-1/2 years (1327 to 1377).

1327. Parliament appointed a council of regency, at the head of which was
Henry, earl of Lancaster; but all the real power was exercised by the
queen and Mortimer. The Scots, under Bruce, invaded England; and Edward,
in pursuing them, narrowly escaped capture.

1328. Peace concluded between the two countries, by which the
=independence of Scotland was completely recognized=.

1329. Death of Robert Bruce, and accession of his son, David II.

1330. Mortimer seized by the king, condemned, and executed. Isabella
confined to her castle at Risings.

1333. Edward supported Edward Baliol (son of John Baliol), in his attempt
to obtain the crown of Scotland, and gained an important victory at
HALIDON HILL (July 19). Berwick, which he had been besieging, surrendered
the next day.

1339. =WAR WITH FRANCE.= Edward invaded France.

    This war arose mainly from two causes:--1, the aid that the French had
    rendered to the Scots in the late war; 2, Edward's claim to the French
    crown. Louis X., Philip V., and Charles IV. had died in succession
    without male issue; and as females were excluded from the throne,
    Philip of Valois was chosen king (1328), and Edward, though he had
    claimed the crown, did homage to him for the duchy of Guienne as his
    liege lord. Edward's claim, as son of Isabella, sister of these three
    kings, was essentially defective, for he had to contend, that though
    females were excluded, such exclusion did not apply to their children;
    but, admitting that such children were eligible, Charles of Navarre,
    grandson of Louis X. (born after Edward had put forth his first
    pretension), had a better right than he. After the campaign of 1340 it
    is probable that Edward would have totally abandoned the enterprise
    had it not been for a revolution in Brittany, which furnished him with
    another opportunity of taking up arms.

1340. Edward gained a great victory over the French fleet at SLUYS (June
24).

1345. Henry, earl of Derby, defeated the French at AUBEROCHE, in Perigord
(Oct. 23).

1346. =Edward gained a glorious victory over the French at= CRESSY: about
30,000 of the enemy slain (Aug. 26). David II. invaded England, and was
defeated and captured at NEVIL'S CROSS, near Durham (Oct. 17).

1347. Calais surrendered to Edward after a siege of 11 months. Truce with
France.

1349. England ravaged by a great pestilence called the Black Plague.
50,000 persons are said to have died in London alone. There was a second
plague of 1361, and a third in 1369. =Order of the Garter established.=
_Statute of Labourers_ passed: labourers ordered to work at the ordinary
wages for any one who required their services.

1351. _Second Statute of Labourers_ passed, fixing the wages of labourers
and artificers. _Statute of Treason_, defining the crime of high treason.
_Statute of Provisions_, forbidding the presentation of benefices by the
pope.

1355. =Renewal of the war with France.=

1356. Edward's eldest son, the Black Prince, defeated and captured King
John near POITIERS (Sept. 19).

1358. A terrible insurrection of the peasants against the nobles broke out
in France.

1360. ~Treaty of Bretigny~, between England and France (May 8).

    Edward renounced his claim to the crown of France, and the ancient
    possessions of his family, but he was to hold, in full sovereignty,
    Calais, Guisnes, Ponthieu, Poitou, Guienne, and their dependencies.

1362. A statute passed, enacting that pleadings in law courts should be
conducted in English.

1367. The Black Prince aided Don Pedro of Castile, and gained the battle
of NAVARETTE, by which the tyrant was restored to his throne.

1370. The bishop and people of Limoges having admitted a French garrison,
the Black Prince invested and captured the town: 3,000 men, women, and
children were butchered in cold blood.

1374. The only possessions that the English retained in France were
Calais, Bordeaux, Bayonne, and a few places on the Dordogne.

1376. Death of the Black Prince.

In this reign _justices of the peace were appointed_. _Growth of the power
of parliament._ Windsor Castle rebuilt and enlarged by William of Wykeham,
a famous architect, afterwards Bishop of Winchester.


RICHARD II., of BORDEAUX.

=D.= He was the son of Edward the Black Prince. =B.= at Bordeaux, 1368.
=M.= (1) to Anne of Bohemia, sister of the Emperor Wenceslaus; (2) to
Isabella, daughter of Charles VI. of France. Deposed, Sept. 29, 1399. Said
to have been murdered in Pontefract Castle, 1400. =R.= 22-1/4 years (1377
to 1399).

1379. A capitation tax, ranging from L6 13s. 4d. to 4d. per head, imposed
by parliament.

1380. A capitation tax voted, of twelvepence per head, on every person
above 15 years of age.

1381. WAT TYLER'S INSURRECTION: caused immediately by the capitation tax,
and its rigorous mode of collection. The insurrection broke out in Kent
under Tyler, and in Essex under Jack Straw. The rebels marched to London,
and committed great excesses. Richard met them at Smithfield, where Tyler
was struck down by the Lord Mayor, and slain. Several concessions were
granted to the insurgents, and afterwards revoked.

1384. Death of John Wycliffe, the 'Morning Star of the Reformation.'

    This famous divine, born in 1324, held doctrines very similar to those
    of the Reformers of the sixteenth century: and by his efforts and
    those of his disciples they were extensively spread among the people.
    His followers were called Wycliffites, or Lollards. His writings are
    very numerous, but the most celebrated is his translation of the Bible
    into English.

1385. The Scots having made incursions in the north of England, Richard
advanced against them, and burnt Edinburgh, Dunfermline, Perth, and
Dundee.

1386. The king's favourites, De Vere, duke of Ireland, and De la Pole,
earl of Suffolk, removed from office, and Suffolk impeached. Richard
compelled to entrust the government to a council of regency, with the duke
of Gloucester, one of his uncles, at the head.

1387. De Vere raised forces in the king's behalf, but was defeated at
RADCOT BRIDGE, in Oxfordshire.

1388. =The Wonderful Parliament= assembled: five of the king's counsellors
convicted of high treason, and two executed. De la Pole and De Vere
escaped out of the country. Henry Percy (Hotspur) defeated by the Scots in
the battle of Chevy Chase at OTTERBURN (Aug. 10).

1389. Richard recovered his authority.

1390. _Navigation Act_: merchandise to be exported in English vessels
only.

1392. _Statute of Praemunire_ passed.

    Persons who purchased, in the court of Rome or elsewhere, bulls or
    other papal instruments, were to be brought before the king and his
    council to answer for their conduct, and were liable to outlawry and
    loss of lands and goods.

1397. The duke of Gloucester arrested and conveyed to Calais, where it was
generally believed he was murdered.

1398. A Parliament at Shrewsbury reversed the acts of the Wonderful
Parliament. Richard banished the Duke of Hereford (Henry Bolingbroke) for
ten years, and the duke of Norfolk for life. =The king's power nearly
absolute.=

1399. Richard visited Ireland. During his absence Hereford, who, by his
father's death, had become duke of Lancaster, invaded England professedly
to recover his estates and honours. On Richard's return he obtained
possession of his person, and forced him to resign the crown. He then
claimed the vacant throne, which was bestowed on him.

In this reign peers were first created by patent. Westminster Hall was
rebuilt.

Sawtre, burnt for holding the doctrines of the Lollards--the first English
martyr.

1402. The Welsh defeated Sir Edmund Mortimer near KNYGHTON, in Radnorshire
(June 12). The Scots invaded England, and were vanquished at NESBIT MOOR
(June 22). They were again defeated by the Percies at HOMILDON HILL (Sept.
14).

1403. =Rebellion of the Percies.= The Percies conspired with Sir Edmund
Mortimer and Owen Glendower, the Welsh chief. Hotspur defeated and slain
at SHREWSBURY (July 21).

    "One of the most obstinate and bloody battles recorded in English
    history."

1405. James of Scotland, son of Robert III., captured as he was proceeding
to France. New conspiracy of Percy, earl of Northumberland, and his
friends. Scrope, archbishop of York, one of the conspirators,
executed--=the first instance in our annals of a prelate undergoing
capital punishment=.

1408. The earl of Northumberland defeated and slain at BRAMHAM MOOR, near
Tadcaster (Feb. 18).

=D.= He was the son of Henry IV. =B.= at Monmouth, 1388. =M.= Catherine,
daughter of Charles VI. of France. =Dd.= at Vincennes, Aug. 31, 1422. =R.=
9-1/2 years (1413 to 1422).

1413. Sir John Oldcastle (commonly called Lord Cobham), one of the
Lollards, condemned as a heretic. He escaped into Wales, but was captured
and burnt in 1417.

1414. Henry demanded the crown of France; and that unreasonable claim
being disregarded, he claimed Normandy, Maine, Touraine, Anjou, Guienne,
and other districts, together with the hand of the Princess Catherine, and
a large dower.

1415. Negotiations continued. The French finally offered the duchy of
Aquitaine and the hand of Catherine, with 800,000 crowns; but these terms
were rejected.

=WAR WITH FRANCE.= Before setting sail for France, Henry detected a
conspiracy to place the earl of March on the throne; Richard, earl of
Cambridge, and other conspirators executed. Siege and capture of HARFLEUR
(Sept. 22). =Henry gained a great victory at= AGINCOURT (Oct. 25); the

absence beyond sea, his brother, the duke of Gloucester. Bedford regent of
France. Charles VI. died, and Henry was proclaimed king.

the earl of Salisbury, one of the ablest of the English commanders (July

years: he was intercepted, and beheaded at sea. =Jack Cade's
insurrection.= Cade taken and slain.

    This rising was thought by some to have been instigated by the friends
    of the duke of York, who, as far as hereditary succession alone was
    concerned, had a better right to the throne than Henry. Richard was
    descended from Lionel, duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III.,
    and Henry from John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, the fourth son.

Somerset was slain, and the king fell into the hands of the Yorkist
faction (May 22). Renewal of his illness. =York made protector a second
time, and with such powers as to give the protectorate a revolutionary
character.=

    This was the first battle in what were called the "Wars of the
    Roses"--a name applied to them because the emblem of the Lancastrians
    was a red, and that of the Yorkists a white rose. Several causes
    combined to bring about the struggle. The principal were--1, the
    feeble and unwarlike character of the king; and 2, the resolute
    determination of the queen and the Somerset family that Henry should
    retain the crown, and that the succession should vest in his son.

1456. Recovery of the king and removal of the protector.

1458. Hollow reconciliation of the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions.

    pension.

1494. Joan Boughton, the first English female martyr, burnt for heresy.

monopolists. Francis Bacon, viscount St. Alban's, convicted of bribery and
corruption in the exercise of his office of Lord Chancellor. The Commons
recorded in their journal that _the liberties of parliament are the
undoubted birthright of the subjects of England_.

1622. On the dissolution of Parliament, Sir Edward Coke, Pym, and some
other distinguished and patriotic members were imprisoned.

1623. Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham proceeded to Spain in
disguise, in order that the prince might see the infanta, to whom he was
engaged to be married. They were received with great honour, but the
marriage treaty was broken off near the close of the year.

1624. The earl of Middlesex convicted of bribery and oppression in the
exercise of his office of lord treasurer.

During about half his reign, James governed without the control of
parliaments. Loans, the sale of honours, enormous fines levied by the Star
Chamber, and, on one occasion, a benevolence, were among the methods he
adopted to secure an income.


CHARLES I.

=D.= He was the son of James I. =B.= at Dunfermline, 1600. =M.= Henrietta
Maria, daughter of Henry IV., of France. =Executed= at Whitehall, Jan. 30,
1649. =R.= 24 years (1625 to 1649).

1625. Charles's first parliament met at Westminster, but was adjourned to
Oxford, as the plague was raging in the capital. The Commons granted a
supply, but, contrary to precedent, voted tonnage and poundage for one
year only. Parliament dissolved because a further supply was refused
unless coupled with a redress of grievances.

1626. Second parliament. Impeachment of the duke of Buckingham, the king's
minister, to save whom parliament was dissolved.

1627. Unsuccessful expedition of the duke of Buckingham to aid the
Protestants at Rochelle. The king raised money by illegal taxation, and by
forced loans: those who resisted the loans were imprisoned.

1628. =Third parliament.= _PETITION OF RIGHT_ drawn up, to which Charles
reluctantly agreed.

    The Petition of Right declared the illegality--1, of all pecuniary
    demands without the consent of parliament; 2, of the punishment of
    persons for refusing to pay such demands; 3, of billeting soldiers and
    mariners on private subjects; 4, of proceedings for punishing persons
    by martial law.

1629. Parliament dissolved for passing resolutions on religion and
taxation which were obnoxious to the king. Some of the principal members
imprisoned.

1632. Lord Wentworth appointed deputy of Ireland.

1633. Laud appointed archbishop of Canterbury.

1634. =Imposition of ship-money= on seaport towns. It was extended to
inland towns in the following year.

1637. John Hampden having refused to pay ship-money, the legality of the
tax was discussed before the judges, who decided in its favour. An attempt
to introduce a book of canons and a liturgy in Scotland led to great
disturbances.

1638. =The Scots drew up a covenant=, by which they pledged themselves to
resist all innovations in religion.

1639. Charles determined to coerce the Scots, who assembled an army. Not
having confidence in his forces, he agreed to an accommodation with the
Scots, known as the ~Pacification of Berwick~.

1640. Fourth parliament assembled, and was soon dissolved, because it
refused to grant money without a redress of grievances. The Scots invaded
England, and defeated the royal vanguard at NEWBURN (Aug. 28). ~Treaty of
Ripon~, by the terms of which the Scottish army was to abstain from all
acts of hostility, on condition of receiving a weekly payment till the
differences between them and the king were adjusted. =THE LONG PARLIAMENT=
assembled (Nov. 3). The earl of Strafford (Lord Wentworth) impeached of
high treason.

1641. A statute passed, enacting that _parliament should not be dissolved
without its own consent_. Execution of the earl of Strafford. The Star
Chamber, High Commission Court, and other arbitrary courts abolished.
=Insurrection of the Catholics in Ireland=, and fearful excesses
committed. The Commons drew up a REMONSTRANCE on the state of the nation.

1642. =Charles went to the House of Commons to arrest five members=--Pym,
Hampden, Haselrig, Hollis, and Strode, whom, with Lord Kimbolton, he had
charged with high treason; but he failed in his attempt, as the obnoxious
members were designedly absent. _The parliament passed a bill for
regulating the militia_, to which he refused his assent. The =CIVIL WAR=,
or =GREAT REBELLION=: Charles raised his standard at Nottingham (Aug. 22).
Indecisive battle at EDGEHILL, in Warwickshire (Oct. 23).

    The immediate cause of the rebellion, says Lord Brougham, were--1. The
    religious zeal, or rather fury, excited by the encouragement which the
    king and queen gave to Popery, and which was greatly magnified, at
    least as concerned him. 2. A conspiracy was discovered of some leading
    persons in the king's party to march the army to London and subdue the
    parliament. 3. That which, more than all the rest, hurried on matters
    to extremities, was the insane step he took of entering, in person,
    the House of Commons, and claiming the surrender of five members, the
    leaders of the party opposed to him, but who had the whole Commons and
    nearly the whole Lords for their followers. That it led immediately to
    the vote which vested in parliament the nomination of militia
    officers--in other words, the command of the army--cannot be doubted;
    and this was the commencement of the Civil War.

1643. Battle of CHALGROVE FIELD, near Oxford, where Hampden was mortally
wounded (June 18); Royalist victories at ATHERTON MOOR, in Yorkshire (June
30), and ROUNDWAY DOWN, near Devizes (July 13). Prince Rupert, the king's
nephew, took BRISTOL, but the king himself failed in an attempt on
GLOUCESTER. Royalists defeated at NEWBURY, in Berkshire, where the earls
of Sunderland and Carnarvon and Lord Falkland were slain (Sept. 20). Death
of Pym.

1644. The king assembled a rival parliament (consisting of the loyal
members) at Oxford. The Scots entered England to aid the Long Parliament.
Royalists defeated at NANTWICH (Jan. 25). The parliamentarians, mainly by
the military genius of Oliver Cromwell, gained a great victory at MARSTON
MOOR, in Yorkshire (July 2). Indecisive battle at NEWBURY (Oct. 27).

1645. Archbishop Laud executed for high treason. A treaty of peace begun
at Uxbridge, but the two parties could not agree as to the terms.
=Self-denying ordinance= passed, ordaining that no member of parliament
should hold in future any civil or military office. =The parliamentarians
gained a decisive victory at= NASEBY, in Northamptonshire (June 14).
Bristol retaken by Sir Thomas Fairfax. The earl of Montrose, who had
gained several victories over the covenanters, was totally defeated at
PHILIPHAUGH, near Selkirk (Sept. 13).

1646. The king surrendered himself to the Scots who were stationed near
Newark (May 5).

END OF THE FIRST CIVIL WAR.

1647. The Scots gave Charles up to the parliament on payment of part of
their arrears. The latter endeavoured to disband the English army, but
failed: and the army seized the king. About five months after, he escaped
to the Isle of Wight, but was arrested and imprisoned in Carisbrooke
Castle.

1648. SECOND CIVIL WAR. A royalist insurrection in Wales was soon
suppressed by Cromwell, who also defeated, at PRESTON, a Scotch army that
had invaded England in behalf of the king (Aug. 17). The Presbyterians, in
the absence of the army, being predominant in parliament, began a treaty
with Charles at Newport; but while the negotiations were proceeding, the
army directed Charles to be removed to Hurst Castle, and Colonel Pride
"purged" the House by forcibly excluding many of the members unfavourable
to the army: this proceeding was known as =Pride's Purge=. The remainder,
or =Rump Parliament=, voted that the king should be brought to trial as
guilty of high treason against the people.

1649. =THE KING= was tried in Westminster Hall, and though he refused to
acknowledge the jurisdiction of the high court of justice, he was
=CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED=.

    PRINCIPAL OFFICERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.--Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice
    (the king's nephews), the earls of Lindsey, Newcastle, and Montrose,
    Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and Goring, royalist
    commanders. The earl of Essex, Lord Kimbolton, afterwards earl of
    Manchester, Sir William Waller, Sir Thomas Fairfax, Hampden, Cromwell,
    Ireton, and Lambert, parliamentary commanders.




The Commonwealth.

1649. Charles II. proclaimed king in Scotland, and soon after in Ireland.
The Commons voted that the House of Lords and the office of King should be
abolished. A council of forty-one persons appointed to conduct the
government. Cromwell went to Ireland, took DROGHEDA and WEXFORD by storm,
and captured several other towns.

1650. Montrose appeared in arms in Scotland on behalf of Charles II., but
was captured, and executed at Edinburgh. Cromwell returned from Ireland,
and about a month after Charles's arrival in Scotland, he crossed the
Tweed (July), and defeated the Scots under General Leslie at DUNBAR (Sept.
3).

1651. Charles crowned at Scone. He raised an army and invaded England, but
was pursued by Cromwell, and defeated at WORCESTER (Sept. 3). After a
series of perilous adventures he escaped to France. _Navigation Act_
passed.

    This act, which aimed a deadly blow at the Dutch carrying trade,
    forbade the importation of goods from Asia, Africa, or America, in any
    ships except such as belonged to English subjects, and in the case of
    European goods they must be imported in English ships, or in ships
    that were the property of the people of the country producing the
    goods.

1652. WAR WITH THE DUTCH. Van Tromp defeated by Blake off DOVER (May 19),
and an indecisive battle was fought between De Ruyter and Ayscue off
PLYMOUTH (Aug. 16). The English were victorious in the DOWNS (Sept. 28),
and defeated in the same neighbourhood two months after (Nov. 29).

1653. The Dutch defeated with great loss off PORTLAND (Feb. 18-20); and
they were again defeated off the NORTH FORELAND (June 2, 3), and off TEXEL
(July 31): Van Tromp killed in the last battle. =Cromwell forcibly
dissolved the Rump Parliament= (April 20). The Little Parliament met, and
about five months after surrendered their power into the hands of
=CROMWELL=, who was declared =LORD PROTECTOR OF THE COMMONWEALTH= (Dec.
16).

1654. Peace concluded with Holland. Scotland incorporated with England.
Cromwell called a new parliament, which met Sept. 3, and was dissolved
early in the next year (Jan. 22).

1655. Capture of Jamaica. The Jews were again allowed to settle in
England.

1657. A parliament, which had first assembled in =1656= (Sept. 17),

empowered to name his successor, and to create a second legislative
assembly.

1658. The French and English defeated the Spaniards at the DUNES, near
Dunkirk (June 4). Dunkirk taken, and surrendered to the English. =DEATH OF
THE PROTECTOR= (Sept. 3). He was succeeded by his son Richard.

1659. A new parliament assembled, but after sitting three months was
dissolved by Richard Cromwell, at the request of the army leaders. He
resigned the Protectorate. The Long (Rump) Parliament reassembled. The
royalists attempted an insurrection, but were defeated at NANTWICH. The
parliament expelled by the army, and a Committee of Safety appointed; but
two months later the parliament was reinstated.

1660. General Monk, the parliamentary commander in Scotland, came to
London with his troops, and at his desire the members expelled by Pride
were readmitted. This parliament resolved that a new parliament should
assemble, and dissolved itself. The =Convention Parliament= met, and
Charles, who was residing at Breda, and with whom Monk had been lately
holding communications, sent, at his suggestion, a letter containing the
=Declaration from Breda=. CHARLES RECALLED. His restoration dates from his
public entry into London (May 29).

    In the Declaration from Breda he promised, among other things,--1. A
    general pardon to all persons, save those who should be afterwards
    excepted by parliament, who should return to their obedience within 40
    days. 2. That all differences about the grants, sales, and purchases
    of estates should be settled in a free parliament. 3. That no man
    should be disquieted for differences of opinion in religion that did
    not disturb the peace of the kingdom.

    PRINCIPAL COMMANDERS.--Ireton, Monk, Lambert, Desborough, Fleetwood,
    generals; Blake, Penn, Venables, Ayscue, admirals.

regicides executed. The Convention Parliament dissolved.

1661. A new parliament, sometimes called the =Pension Parliament=, met,
and sat for seventeen years. _Corporation Act_ passed. Savoy Conference,
between some of the bishops and leading presbyterian divines.

1662. _Act of Uniformity_ passed. Iniquitous execution of Sir Harry Vane.
Dunkirk sold to the French.

1664. _Conventicle Act_ passed. Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam (now New
York) surrendered to the English.

1665. =War with the Dutch.= The English gained a great victory over them
off LOWESTOFT (June 3). The =Great Plague= raged in London, and carried
off more than 100,000 victims. _Five Mile Act_ passed.

    The Corporation Act, the Act of Uniformity, the Conventicle Act, and
    the Five Mile Act are called the Clarendon Code. The Corporation Act
    required all persons holding offices in municipal corporations to take
    the sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites of the
    Church of England--to renounce the Solemn League and Covenant--and to
    swear that they believed it unlawful to take up arms, upon any
    pretence whatsoever, against the king. The Act of Uniformity required
    all clergymen to declare their assent to everything contained in the
    Prayer Book, and all schoolmasters were obliged to have a licence from
    the bishop. About 2,000 clergymen declined to subscribe, and were
    ejected from their livings: and, receiving no compensation from the
    state, were, in many cases, reduced to the utmost poverty. The
    Conventicle Act declared all meetings of more than five persons,
    except the household, for religious worship not according to the
    Prayer Book, seditious; and all persons above sixteen years old, who
    attended, for a first offence were to be fined or imprisoned for three
    months; for a second, fined or imprisoned for six months; and for a
    third, transported for seven years. The Five Mile Act required all
    dissenting ministers to take an oath similar to that imposed by the
    Corporation Act, and, in case of refusal, they were not to approach
    within five miles of any borough or place where they had ever
    preached, nor to act as schoolmasters, under a penalty of L40 and six
    months' imprisonment.

1666. Louis XIV. of France joined the Dutch against England. The Dutch
defeated the English off the NORTH FORELAND (June 1-4), but were
afterwards vanquished in the same neighbourhood (July 25). =Great Fire of
London=: the loss caused by the fire estimated at more than L7,000,000.
Some of the presbyterians rose in Scotland, and were defeated on the
PENTLAND HILLS (Nov. 28).

1667. The Dutch sailed up the Medway, and burnt several ships; and for
some time insulted our coasts. ~Treaty of Breda~, between the English,
Dutch, and French (July 21). Lord Clarendon, the king's chief minister
from the beginning of the reign, dismissed and banished. The Cabal
ministry formed; the chief ministers being Clifford, Arlington,
Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale.

aggressive policy of Louis. ~Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle~.

1670. A new act passed against conventicles. Secret treaty concluded
between Charles and Louis at Dover.

    Charles agreed to declare himself a Catholic, to support Louis's
    foreign policy, to receive a pension, and to be aided by foreign
    troops in case of a rebellion. But, on account of the temper of the
    country, he was afraid to carry out the first stipulation.

1672. Charles shut up the exchequer, and thereby ruined a large number of
persons whose money was in the hands of the government. He issued a
declaration of indulgence to Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists, but
it was withdrawn the next year, at the request of parliament. England and
France declared war against Holland, and the Dutch were defeated off
SOUTHWOLD BAY (May 28).

1673. _Test Act_ passed. The duke of York, being a Catholic, resigned his
office of lord high admiral. Sir Thomas Osborne, better known as the earl
of Danby, became chief minister.

    By the Test Act all officers of the Crown were required to take the
    oath of allegiance and supremacy, to take the sacrament according to
    the usage of the Church of England, and to declare their disbelief in
    transubstantiation.

1674. Peace concluded with Holland.

1677. _The statute for burning heretics repealed._ William, prince of
Orange, married Mary, daughter of James, duke of York.

1678. =Titus Oates' plot.= He falsely asserted that the Catholics were
plotting against the king's life, and several persons were executed for
their alleged share in the plot. Impeachment of the earl of Danby; but the
proceeding was stayed by the prorogation of the parliament, which was
dissolved in 1679.

1679. Charles called a third parliament.[2] A new ministry formed by Sir
William Temple, of which the earl of Shaftesbury was president. _HABEAS
CORPUS ACT_ passed.

    [2] _I.e._ if we regard the Convention Parliament as the first.

A bill introduced to exclude the duke of York from the throne, but
frustrated by the dissolution of parliament. Insurrection in Scotland; the
duke of Monmouth, an illegitimate son of the king, defeated the rebels at
BOTHWELL BRIDGE (June 22). =Meal Tub Plot=, so called because some
documents relative to another plot were placed in a meal tub. The earl of
Shaftesbury (Ashley) removed from the presidency of the council, and Sir
William Temple and other ministers soon resigned.

    The Habeas Corpus Act was passed to prevent the illegal and indefinite
    imprisonment to which persons obnoxious to the government could be
    subjected. By its provisions--1. All persons except those charged with
    treason or felony could demand from one of the judges a writ of Habeas
    Corpus, directing the jailor to bring them before him, so that the
    validity of their detention might be tested. 2. All persons charged
    with treason or felony must be tried at the next sessions after
    commitment, or else admitted to bail, and if not tried at the second
    sessions they must be discharged. 3. No person could be recommitted
    for the same offence. 4. No person was to be imprisoned beyond sea. 5.
    Heavy penalties were imposed on those who violated the provisions of
    the Act.

1680. A fourth parliament, summoned in 1679, did not actually meet till
Oct., 1680. The Commons passed a bill for excluding the duke of York, but
it was rejected by the Lords, and the parliament was dissolved in the
following January.

1681. A fifth parliament met at Oxford, but as the Commons resolved to
introduce an exclusion bill it was hastily dissolved. Shaftesbury charged
with high treason, but the grand jury threw out the bill. =The king's
government became very despotic.=

1683. =The Rye House Plot= discovered: some of the principal parties
concerned--as the duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, and Algernon Sidney--had
apparently discussed the feasibility of compelling the king to establish a
constitutional government, but some of the inferior persons implicated had
formed a design to assassinate him. Russell and Sidney tried for high
treason, and executed. Monmouth was pardoned, but withdrew to Holland.

1684. Titus Oates convicted of having libelled the duke of York, fined
L100,000, and imprisoned in default of payment.

6, 1701. =R.= 3-3/4 years (1685 to 1688).

1685. Catholic worship publicly celebrated in the palace. Meeting of
parliament; the majority of the members very favourable to the king.
=Rebellions of Argyle and Monmouth=: the earl of Argyle landed in
Scotland, and attempted to raise a rebellion, but was taken and executed;
and the duke of Monmouth landed in Dorsetshire, raised a rebellion, and
assumed the title of king, but was defeated at SEDGEMOOR, in Somersetshire
(July 6), and afterwards executed. =Jeffreys' bloody campaign=, during
which he condemned a large number of persons for their share in the
rebellion. Persecution of Dissenters. Revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
in France. The parliament was prorogued because it disapproved of the
king's violation of the Test Act, and of his maintaining a standing army.

1686. The judges servilely decided that the king could dispense with penal
laws in particular cases--a decision which enabled him to confer offices
in church and state on Catholics, contrary to the Act of Uniformity and
the Test Act. Establishment of a court similar to the High Commission
Court.

1687. Rochester, the king's brother-in-law, deprived of the
lord-treasurership because he would not become a Catholic. Declaration of
Indulgence published, allowing Catholics and Protestant Dissenters to
perform their religious services openly. The universities resisted the
king's attempts to infringe their rights.

1688. He re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, and ordered the clergy
to read it in the churches. Seven of the bishops presented a petition to
him, praying that he would not insist on their distributing and reading
the Declaration, and were on that account prosecuted for libel, but
acquitted, to the great joy of the nation. Birth of the Old Pretender.
William, prince of Orange, being invited to invade England, landed at
Torbay; and James, distrusting his army, tried to escape from the country,
but failed. Close of his reign (Dec. 11). =THE REVOLUTION.=

       *       *       *       *       *

1688. William arrived in London, and James escaped to France. The peers,
and a second chamber, consisting of members who had sat in Charles II.'s
parliaments, together with the aldermen of London, and a deputation from
the Common Council, requested William to call a Convention, and to take
on himself the executive administration in the interim.

1689. The Convention declared the throne vacant, and offered the crown to
William and Mary, the former of whom was to exercise the executive power;
they also drew up a Declaration of Rights, which was subsequently embodied
in the Bill of Rights. William and Mary accepted the crown (Feb. 13). THE
REVOLUTION COMPLETED.


WILLIAM AND MARY.

=D.= William was the son of William, prince of Orange, and of Mary,
daughter of Charles I. =B.= at the Hague, 1650. =M.= Mary, daughter of
James II. (b. 1662). =Dd.= at Kensington, Mar. 8, 1702. Mary. =Dd.= at
Kensington, Dec. 28, 1694. =R.= together 5 years (1689 to 1694). William

General Kirke (July 30). _BILL OF RIGHTS_ passed.

    The Toleration Act exempted Dissenters from the penalties of the
    existing statutes on religion, and enabled their ministers to conduct
    public worship on making certain subscriptions and declarations. The
    Bill of Rights declared--1, That it is illegal to suspend laws without
    consent of parliament; 2, That the pretended power of dispensing with
    laws, as it hath been exercised of late, is illegal; 3, That the
    commission for creating the late court of commissioners for
    ecclesiastical causes is illegal; 4, That it is illegal to levy money
    without consent of parliament; 5, That subjects have a right to
    petition the king; 6, That it is illegal to maintain a standing army
    in time of peace without consent of parliament; 7, That Protestant
    subjects may have arms for their defence; 8, That election of members
    of parliament ought to be free; 9, That freedom of speech and debate
    in parliament ought not to be questioned in any place out of
    parliament; 10, That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor
    excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted;
    11, That juries ought to be impartially selected; 12, That grants of
    fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal; 13, That for the
    redress of grievances parliaments ought to be held frequently. It was
    further enacted, that every English sovereign should, in full
    parliament, repeat and subscribe the declaration against
    transubstantiation; and that if a sovereign should marry a papist, the
    subjects should be absolved from allegiance.

1690. William went to Ireland, and defeated James at the battle of the
BOYNE (July 1). James returned to France. The English and Dutch fleets

passed for regulating trials for high treason._

    Prisoners were to be allowed counsel; and two witnesses were required
    to prove each overt act.

1697. A bill of attainder passed against Sir John Fenwick, for
participation in a plot for assassinating the king, and he was executed
accordingly. =He was the last person condemned by bill of attainder.=
~Treaty of Ryswick~, between England, France, Spain, Holland, and the
emperor of Germany (Sept. 20).

    By this treaty William was acknowledged king of England; and nearly
    all the places in the Spanish dominions conquered by France were to be
    restored.

1698. First partition treaty between William and Louis for dividing the
Spanish dominions on the death of Charles II., king of Spain. A second
treaty was concluded in 1700.

    The purpose of these private treaties was to prevent the
    disarrangement of the balance of power which would ensue in case the
    whole of the Spanish dominions fell into the hands of Louis' son, the
    dauphin. By the first treaty they were to be divided between the
    electoral prince of Bavaria, the Dauphin, and the archduke Charles,
    all of whom had pretensions to the Spanish throne. On the death of the
    electoral prince (in 1699) they were to be divided between the
    survivors. Charles, on his death, left the whole to Philip of Anjou,
    grandson of Louis, who determined, in spite of his agreement with
    William, to support his grandson; and hence ensued the war in the next
    reign.

1700. Death of the duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne, and heir
presumptive to the throne.

1701. _ACT OF SETTLEMENT_ passed. William formed a grand alliance against
France in behalf of the Archduke Charles, whom the allies recognised as
king of Spain. Death of James II., whose son James was acknowledged king
of England by Louis XIV.

    By the Act of Settlement, Anne was to succeed William; and if she died
    without issue, the heirs of William were to succeed: in failure of
    these, the Electress Sophia (granddaughter of James I.), the next in
    succession who held the Protestant faith, was to become sovereign.
    Several provisions were inserted which were to take effect from the
    accession of the new line:--1. The sovereign must join in communion
    with the Church of England. 2. The nation shall not be obliged to go
    to war for the defence of any dominions not belonging to the English
    crown. 3. No English sovereign shall leave the kingdom without consent
    of parliament. 4. All important matters of state are to be transacted
    in the privy council, and all resolutions adopted signed by such of
    the privy council as shall advise and consent to the same. 5. No
    foreigner shall hold any office, civil or military, or receive any
    grant from the crown. 6. No person, holding any office or place of
    profit under the crown, and receiving a pension therefrom, shall be
    capable of sitting in the house of commons. 7. Judges shall hold
    office during good behaviour, but they may be removed on address of
    both houses of parliament. 8. No pardon under the great seal shall be
    pleadable to an impeachment by the Commons. The third provision was
    repealed in the first year of George I.'s reign.

=M.= Prince George, of Denmark. =Dd.= at Kensington, Aug. 1, 1714. =R.=
12-1/2 years (1702 to 1714).

1702. The earl of Marlborough appointed captain-general of the royal
forces. Lord Godolphin made treasurer--Marlborough and he became

approved of their war policy. WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION: War declared
against France and Spain.

1703. The duke of Marlborough captured Bonn and other towns.

1704. Gibraltar taken by Sir George Rooke (July 23). =Marlborough and
Prince Eugene gained a splendid victory over the French and Bavarians at

1706. Marlborough gained a great victory over the French at RAMILIES, in
Belgium (May 23).

1707. ACT OF UNION PASSED BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. The English and
their allies disastrously defeated at ALMANZA, in Spain, by the duke of
Berwick (April 25). _First United Parliament of Great Britain met_ (Oct.
23).

    The chief provisions of the Act of Union were--1, That the succession
    of the crown should vest in the Princess Sophia and her heirs, being
    Protestants; 2, That both nations should have full freedom of trade,
    and should enjoy equal rights and privileges, except where otherwise
    agreed; 3, That Scotland should retain the presbyterian church, her
    own municipal laws, and her own courts of justice; 4, That the united
    kingdom should be governed by one parliament; 5, That 16 peers and 45
    commoners should represent Scotland in parliament; 6, That the
    regulations relating to trade, customs, and excise, should be the same
    in both countries, and that Scotland should only pay one-fortieth of
    the land tax paid by England.

1708. The French defeated by Marlborough at OUDENARDE, in Belgium (July
11). Conquest of Minorca. Lille surrendered to the allies after an active
siege. Mrs. Masham was gradually supplanting the duchess of Marlborough as
the queen's favourite, and was intriguing to bring the Tories into power.

1709. The French defeated by Marlborough and Prince Eugene at MALPLAQUET,
in Flanders, but the loss of the victors was greater than that of the
vanquished (Sept. 11).

1710. Dr. Sacheverell tried and convicted for publishing sermons
reflecting on the revolution and the Protestant succession; but the lenity
of the sentence was regarded as a triumph by the High Church party. Mrs.
Masham obtained a complete ascendancy, and the duchess of Marlborough was
dismissed at the beginning of the next year. Lord Godolphin and the other
Whig ministers dismissed; Harley made chancellor of exchequer, and St.
John secretary of state (Aug. 8). The allies, under General Stanhope,
gained the battles of ALMENARA (July 27) and SARAGOSSA (Aug. 20), but he
was afterwards compelled to capitulate at BRIHUEGA (Dec. 9), and General
Staremberg, though nominally victorious at VILLA VICIOSA (Dec. 10), was
obliged to make a forced retreat.

1711. Harley created earl of Oxford, and appointed lord treasurer.
Marlborough forced the lines of the French, and took Bouchain, but was
afterwards removed from office.

1713. ~Treaty of Utrecht~: between France, England, and all her allies,
except the emperor; a treaty most discreditable to the English ministry
(April 11 and July 13).

    The terms of this treaty were very much more favourable to the French
    than they could have reasonably expected, and than they would have
    been, had the Whigs remained in power. Among the principal terms that
    concerned England were--1, That the French and Spanish crowns should
    never become united; 2, That the Protestant succession should be
    acknowledged by France; 3, That the fortifications of Dunkirk should
    be destroyed; 4, That Hudson's Bay, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
    Gibraltar, and Minorca should be ceded to England. The principal
    object of the war--the exclusion of the Bourbons from the throne of
    Spain--was not secured. At the close of the war the national debt was
    about L38,000,000.

1714. Death of the Princess Sophia. _Schism Act_ passed. Harley removed
from office, and succeeded by his colleague St. John, created Viscount
Bolingbroke. He plotted to restore the Pretender on the death of the
queen, but her sudden illness enabled the dukes of Shrewsbury, Somerset,
and Argyle, three of the Whig leaders, to thwart his intentions, for the
lord treasurer's staff was bestowed on the first-mentioned peer--"the only
individual who mainly assisted in both the great changes of dynasty of
1688 and 1714."

    The object of the Schism Act was to prevent Dissenters from acting as
    tutors or schoolmasters; but it did not come into operation, on
    account of the death of the queen.

duke of Newcastle and he coalesced (June), and thus began what may be
strictly called PITT'S ADMINISTRATION, though Newcastle was the nominal

    During the war with the United States many engagements took place at

    their own, they gained several victories; but the superiority of the

    Shannon and Chesapeake, for the latter, though containing a much
    larger crew, was taken in fifteen minutes.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
