SERIAL PUBLICATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

The emphasis upon publications as a means of diffusing knowledge was
expressed by the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In his
formal plan for the Institution, Joseph Henry articulated a program that
included the following statement: "It is proposed to publish a series of
reports, giving an account of the new discoveries in science, and of the
changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge." This
keynote of basic research has been adhered to over the years in the
issuance of thousands of titles in serial publications under the
Smithsonian imprint, commencing with Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge in 1848 and continuing with the following active series:

    Smithsonian Annals of Flight
    Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology
    Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics
    Smithsonian Contributions to Botany
    Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences
    Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology
    Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology
    Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology

In these series, the Institution publishes original articles and
monographs dealing with the research and collections of its several
museums and offices and of professional colleagues at other institutions
of learning. These papers report newly acquired facts, synoptic
interpretations of data, or original theory in specialized fields. These
publications are distributed by mailing lists to libraries,
laboratories, and other interested institutions and specialists
throughout the world. Individual copies may be obtained from the
Smithsonian Institution Press as long as stocks are available.

Introduction

The art and science of agriculture embrace most intentional human
efforts to control biological activity so as to produce plants and
animals of the sort wanted, when wanted. Rubber plantations, cattle
ranches, vegetable gardens, dairy farms, tree farms, and a host of
similar enterprises all represent human efforts to compel nature to
serve man. Those who undertake agriculture have had, from time
immemorial, a variety of names, not all of them complimentary. The
people involved in attempted biological control have been called
farmers, planters, ranchers, and peasants. Farmers carry on a
complicated business in which they use a variety of tools, implements,
and machines. They also employ land, chemicals, water, plants, and
animals. Their business, however, focuses on living things. No matter
how crude their attempts, or how uncertain their successes, those who
try to grow living things rank as agriculturalists.[1]

[Footnote 1: Of course, the definition excludes brewers, distillers,
biological supply houses, and others, such as zoo curators, who manage
living things. Agriculture takes place on a piece of land widely and
commonly known as a farm.]

For the most part, a museum cannot show the essential biological aspects
of agriculture. Agricultural production involves the farmer in the
course of nature in its seasons, and in the peculiar laws of living
things. In these respects, agriculture stands rather apart from
transportation, manufacturing, and artistic industries where the tools,
machines, and raw materials remain fairly inert as men work on them.
Machines move but do not live, and therein lies the major difference
between agriculture and the other arts. Farmers deal with plants and
animals but the museum can show only the things a farmer uses as he
accommodates to and regulates nature. Some of the objects, in
themselves, give a fair idea of how the farmer used them. Most people,
after all, know about edged blades and digging tools. Nearly anyone can
grasp what a man might do with a scythe or a plow. Even the working of a
modern reaper needs only a little explanation. But museums cannot well
show cross-breeding of plants and animals. Museums seldom can show the
results of that cross-breeding. Bags of fertilizer can be put on
display, as can vials of penicillin, and jars of herbicide. Although
some may find these interesting, such items show little in and of
themselves.

Unfortunately, the things that cannot be shown in any easily
intelligible way surpass in importance the items that can be shown. The
sheep shears, which anyone can understand, represent less to the farmer
than do the sheep. Sheep shears, no matter how sophisticated and no
matter how necessary, do not explain sheep husbandry. The shears tell
little about the wool industry, and nothing much about sheep breeds. And
so on through the list of agricultural enterprises.

Museums must collect and exhibit the tools, implements, and machines
which farmers use in their business. These items, however, seldom make
up the core of real agricultural activity. The catalog here presented
shows something of the range of items that farmers use and that can be
preserved and shown. The variety nearly equals the volume. Most museums
try to avoid duplication. Even so, few museums manage to collect a
continuous series of things showing any one line of development. The
discontinuity of farm objects on hand virtually rules out the telling of
a coherent and complete history of agriculture. Nevertheless, the museum
can show something about the major technological developments in
agriculture. The evolution of the plow, the reaper, or the tractor can
be suggested even if not fully illustrated. Hitting the highlights has
to suffice.

The full history of technological change also involves several social
and economic conditions.

First, changes in implements, tools, and methods result from the
accumulation of knowledge. Device builds upon device: first came the
wheel, and then, much later, the tractor.

Secondly, the potential user of the device must feel a need for it. The
new method or device not only must save him work but must clearly
increase his well-being. If any device or change merely increases the
wealth of someone else (a tax collector or a landlord for example), the
farmer seldom will adopt the new technology.

Thirdly, since, at first, the new technology almost invariably costs
more than the old, the user must have or be able to get the capital to
buy and use the newer devices and methods.

Of these conditions for technological change, only the cumulative nature
of the knowledge can be shown by the objects. Even here, however,
missing objects make it possible to present only the most obvious
changes, and then not all of them. Still, seeing the things once
used--no matter how crude or how few--can sometimes help us understand
the way changes took place. Also, this knowledge sometimes can help us
guess how other changes will take place:

     The sequence of inventions also depends upon the changing needs of
     a society. Needs and circumstances vary more than do degrees of
     talent. Thus when need and knowledge merge, inventors quickly
     appear. Indeed, several men in several places are likely to work on
     the same problems at the same time, and they often solve it in
     almost identical fashion. Nearly simultaneous inventions or
     discoveries occur with astonishing frequency in the history of
     technology.[2]

The Use of Farm Machinery in America

The part of America that was destined to become the United States
started its history at the very time when the parent European
civilization began to make major breakthroughs in science and
technology. Thus, Americans became the automatic beneficiaries of the
achievements of others. Because of peculiar opportunities and needs,
Americans could and did push on to unique achievements. Nowhere,
however, did this building on the past appear as early, or as
impressively, as in the agricultural sector of the economy. American
inventors of farm implements made important strides earlier than those
in any other field. In turn, American farmers made more and better use
of discoveries and inventions.

From the 1650s onward Europeans expanded their activities in all fields
and in all directions. By that time Europeans had already discovered the
New World, and had seized or bullied most of the Old. European trade and
industry increased, and as these grew so also did population and
urbanization. People multiplied, and an increasingly greater proportion
of them began to live in towns and cities. Simultaneously, the Europeans
increased in wealth; indeed, most of their activities created more
wealth. The ever-increasing number of people called for more food, and
for changes in European farming. The Europeans' growing wealth also
allowed them to buy luxury items from around the world: silk and spice
and everything nice. The goods came not only from the Far East and
Africa but also from the New World. When Europeans began to settle
America, they almost at once had the advantages of a large and growing
metropolitan market in western Europe. This market provided
opportunities for wealth, but only if the American farmers developed
appropriate commodities and produced them at reasonable prices.

The English, Dutch, Swedes, French, and Spanish settled in North America
at trading and exploring stations. So located, they could direct the
flow of products to Europe. The English chiefly sought rare products
such as gold and spices, and they sent back furs. The Dutch concentrated
on furs. All European pioneers, however, had to feed themselves. This
took a bit of doing, which at first involved a merging of European
technology with Indian crops and methods. Later, the settlers adapted
European crops and animals. In spite of starving times in almost every
colony from Virginia to New England, the new Americans at least mastered
the art of feeding themselves.

European technology used animals for draft and employed plows, harrows,
and similar implements. This technology fit European crops better than
it fit American crops. Thus, European implements and draft animals did
not appear until comparatively late. As long as they depended chiefly on
Indian crops, Europeans simply substituted iron hoes for stone hoes, and
iron axes for stone axes. But methods such as girdling, slash and burn,
and the rest, came almost directly from Indian technology. The Pilgrims
of Plymouth Plantation went 12 years without a plow; Virginians went
almost as long. The hoe of corn culture served well enough to keep men
alive. Hunting and fishing, of course, supplemented the food supply, as
it did for the Indians.

From north to south the story was largely the same in the 17th century.
Everywhere the new Americans pursued a subsistence agriculture which
supported some other major economic activity. Pennsylvania developed
possibly the most flourishing subsistence farming. The commercial
production of tobacco, an American crop with American methods and uses,
began early in Virginia and Maryland. This specialty developed
commercially almost exclusively in the upper South. Farmers and planters
of the lower South had hesitantly begun rice culture, but as the 17th
century ended men in the Carolinas still found hides and furs the most
rewarding commodities. Meanwhile, rapid changes took place in the
European metropolitan centers, and in the West Indian islands. The
growth of population in both places created consumers for more and
cheaper food. Markets for American foods definitely began to increase as
the 18th century got under way.

Europeans, of course, primarily wanted European foods rather than exotic
Indian crops. The foods also had to be comparatively nonperishable and
easily transported. Grains, particularly wheat, and processed meat
(hams, salt pork, and such) especially met European preferences.
Commercial production of these commodities compelled American farmers to
embrace the best European technology insofar as that technology fit the
American scene. The plants, animals, methods, and tools all derived from
Europe. Contrary to a common European view at the time, the immigrants
did not bring the worst available methods to the New World. Nor did the
Americans allow any deterioration of stock or plants without good
economic reasons.

Most European criticism about American farming centered on things of no
consequence to American farmers, who were selling in a world market.
True, Americans tended toward slovenly cultivation, but niceness of
method mattered little if the land yielded an abundant exportable
surplus. Americans paid less attention than Europeans to fertilizer, but
Americans at first had less need for it. Livestock, in spite of nearly
continual importations from Europe, tended to decline from a European
standpoint. Still, the animals yielded meat of a quality suitable for
export. The hardy American animals could survive in spite of casual
care. Americans had few barns and sheds, but the world market for meat
did not demand barns, stalls, and fancy feeding. American dairy cows
yielded ridiculously low volumes of milk, butter, and cheese, but dairy
products, after all, served only the resident Americans. The corn- and
mast-fed hogs of America provided ham that was equal to any in Europe.
If the European consumer bought American food, the American farmer
thought it pointless to consider the comfort and emotional well-being of
his animals.

New Englanders tended to concentrate on animals, the middle Atlantic on
grains, the upper South on tobacco, and the lower South on rice and
indigo. The Revolutionary War disrupted the marketing from the farmer's
view, but the major commercial commodities remained largely unchanged in
the years immediately after the war. Indigo declined and then
disappeared as a major export commodity, but cotton almost at once
replaced it.

In the 19th century men everywhere made great technological advances. In
America, the advances took place in a sort of reciprocal action with
three major historical series and events dominating the story: the
westward movement, urbanization, and industrialization.

The greatest westward expansion in American history took place during
the 19th century. American farmers and stockmen conquered, and almost
entirely settled, a continent. They did this in a single century,
1801-1900. Nothing quite like it had ever happened before. Starting from
a thin line of people on the eastern seaboard (with a few incursions
across the mountains as of 1800), farmers and herders pushed into a
nearly empty land, dispossessed the Indians, and exploited the country.
And in course of time the American pioneers wanted and received
political organization. California entered the Union in 1850, the Plains
states mostly in the 1880s, and more states, such as Arizona, New
Mexico, and Oklahoma, came into the Union in the 20th century.

At the same time, a nation that was weak and underdeveloped in 1801,
had, by 1900, become the world's leading industrial nation. From
virtually no industry in 1801, America rose to leading industrial power
in 1900, with more railroads and more manufactured goods per capita than
any other nation. Involved in the industrialization, and importantly so,
was the farm implement and machinery industry. Factories everywhere
supplied farmers with the sophisticated tools and machines of the new
agriculture.

In these years urbanization also went forward rapidly. Cities of the
east grew fantastically, and even in the interior cities rose from
wilderness outposts to gigantic metropolises. Within one man's lifetime
Chicago increased from 350 people in 1830 to 1,099,000 in 1890.
Simultaneously, tremendous developments in transportation kept the
nation and its economy tied together. All of these developments had a
profound influence on farming and farmers. The rich cities provided ever
greater markets for the farmers' produce. The transportation system,
rapidly moving farm commodities, made farming profitable in remote
regions far distant from the coast. Farmers also felt the advantages of
the return flow of goods and services: the mail order catalog, the
industrially made reapers and threshers, and countless other items. City
people made a countless range of devices for farmers--from steel plows
to steam engines.

Meanwhile, as these events altered the life of the farmer, a burst of
activity took place in invention and discovery. These activities had a
delayed but considerable impact on farm methods and technology. The list
of inventions and discoveries could hardly fit in this narrative, but
this catalog of items reflects fairly well what men accomplished in the
19th century. The changes included such diverse elements as the
invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793, the introduction of
Mexican Upland cotton in 1805, the discovery of the cause of Texas fever
in cattle in 1889, and the invention of the internal combustion tractor
in 1892. These and many other achievements substantially changed the
farm enterprise in two major directions: first, advances in technology
allowed farmers to do more in less time; second, discoveries in science
allowed farmers to increase the yield from the land. Farmers got more
from each acre, plant, and animal.

Farmers could use the savings in time brought by better implements and
new machines to increase the amount of land farmed and the number of
animals cared for. Presumably, the farmer could also use the saved time
for greater leisure. In fact, however, they usually used the extra time
for more work. In the 20th century they often used the saved time for
outside employment. Farmers did this in the 19th century, but not so
commonly as later. Greater man-hour efficiency gave the farmer more time
to devote to managing his enterprise, to keeping records, and to
studying his business.

Technological efficiency also allowed farmers to use more land and more
animals. The average size of farms steadily increased across the
century. Furthermore, the new machines and the pure-bred livestock cost
money which could be most profitable only if the farmer specialized in
one, or at most two, types of enterprise. So the greater efficiency
created by technology impelled farmers to greater specialization, and
with specialization came even greater efficiency. Anyone who specializes
will likely be more efficient because of the mastering of skills. He
will also have a minimum of other cares to distract him. Of course, for
the consumers, foreign or domestic, greater farming efficiencies
resulted in abundant food at comparatively low cost.

Plant and animal importation, improvement of breeds, and discoveries in
genetics, soil chemistry, the use of fertilizers, and in controlling
plant and animal diseases all helped the living things which form the
basis of farming yield. Grain farmers not only had to have a wheat which
yielded well but a wheat which resisted the attacks of nature. For
example, Turkey Red wheat, introduced in 1873 by Mennonites from Russia,
not only survived drought and yielded well but provided the genetic
elements for newer breeds of wheat. The farmer not only wanted
good-producing meat cattle, such as the Herefords, but had to control
diseases and predators which killed the animals. Sick animals do not
grow properly or, in the case of dairy animals, give much milk. Steady
advances in disease control for both plants and animals brought fewer
losses and greater productivity to farmers.

The 19th century also brought scientific discoveries in both plant and
animal nutrition. Fertilizer and soil chemistry made great advances
through scientific experiments, at first by farmers and later by
government servants. The first experiment station in the modern era
began in Connecticut in 1875, and in 1887 the Congress established such
stations in every state in conjunction with the agricultural Land Grant
colleges. Scientists at many of the stations also made discoveries in
animal nutrition. For example, as a result of animal feeding experiments
E. V. McCollum discovered vitamins A and B at the experiment station in
Wisconsin in 1915.

None of these scientific advances left much residue in the form of
artifacts for museums, but the reality of the changes should not be
obscured by the lack of objects on exhibit. Even so, some of the related
equipment survived. For example, the centrifuge used in the butterfat
test, discovered in 1890 by Stephen M. Babcock, survived in several
forms. Manure spreaders and tree sprayers, reflective of advances in
biochemistry, also survived. But these only suggest the more important
biological control activities for which these machines and tools served
merely as agents in some way.

The 20th century introduced Americans to total war. World Wars I and II
demanded the total mobilization of all resources by all contenders. In
both conflicts America became the food reservoir of the Allies. From a
technological view, the wars engendered a level of prosperity which both
allowed and encouraged farmers to adopt new methods and devices. The
principal technological change in farms was the widespread adoption of
the internal combustion tractor, first used in 1892. Inventors and
manufacturers gradually but constantly improved tractors along with the
various devices attached to them. Most notable were the corn picker, in
1909, and the cotton picker, in 1942. (Dates are for commercial
production in each instance.) Farmers found both machines impracticable
until a power source independent of the ground wheel had been developed.
More than anything else the tractor and its related equipment finally
set men free from the worst drudgery of farming. It also set many
farmers free from the need to farm at all.

The tractor and its equipment accomplished several other remarkable
things, some obvious and some not so obvious. First, it allowed the
farmer to get rid of horses and mules, and these animals steadily
declined--to such an extent that in the 1960s the census did not even
bother to count them. As a result of this decline, land that farmers had
used to raise feed for animals could grow food for people or fodder for
dairy animals. The amount of land thus released for other needs finally
amounted to perhaps 60 million acres, and maybe even more. The change
took place with increasing rapidity into the 20th century.

Also, the tractor sharply reduced labor needs for the major crops of the
United States. Even dairying, least susceptible to this sort of
improvement, felt the impact of the tractor in such things as harvesting
fodder and storing silage by running loaders off the tractor
power-take-off. Since the very founding of agriculture men had
discovered only one way to prosper in farming. The farmer had to exploit
somebody or something. Animals, serfs, slaves, tenants, sharecroppers,
or whatever, including the farmer's family and farm, had at various
times been exploited on the farmer's way to success. After the age of
machinery, however, the farmer tended to exploit the machine instead of
other people or things. People had to leave farming, but in the long run
they benefited from their removal. The machine had set them free. Chief
of the machines was the gasoline tractor.

The influence of science and technology inside a free society may have
been even more profound than seems at first glance. The farming of the
20th century, with its chemicals, genetics, machines, and all, required
not only vast infusions of capital but brains and a considerable
knowledge. Farmers had to be literate at the very least. Elitist
systems, where one group of people get educated and the others get
worked, could not accomplish much in the modern agricultural world.
Furthermore, notions of two kinds of education--one for the better sort
who think, and another for the inferiors who do the work--could and did
seriously impede the development of a modern agriculture. The
backwardness of most of the world, the poverty of the underdeveloped
countries, stemmed in large part from the impediments created by an
ignorant population.

A country like the United States with its highly technical and
scientific farming could not afford, simply could not endure, limited
educational opportunities for its people. Neither could it long endure
any class structure which placed farmers in an inferior position; for
when men feel inferior because of their work they tend to shift to some
other task, leaving the despised work to those who cannot avoid it. A
highly developed agriculture in the hands of the truly inferior, the
stupid and uneducated, would simply collapse. America, the land of
plenty, had to maintain a high level of education open to all and a
society where men reached status, at least partly, by effort and talent.
In 20th century America the comparative social and economic equality
continued, in large part, because the level of technology and science
used in America demanded it. This equality may be one of the most
important consequences of the technological and scientific advances in
agriculture during the years 1607-1972.


Catalog of Agricultural Implements and Machines in the Collection

In the following catalog the items are listed numerically in the order
in which the museum received them, with the earliest first and the
latest last. This arrangement permits expansion and reissue of the
catalog simply by adding new entries; and the user of the catalog can
easily find everything acquired in any given year. In effect, the
catalog thus presents an historical account of the development of the
museum collection. Following the item's title appears the National
Museum accession number (USNM number); year of accession, if known;
description; and donor.

The index to the catalog has several major categories of
cross-referenced entries. In addition to the general object class, such
as "Tractor," it includes use-entries, such as "Plant husbandry," the
names of donors, vendors, and those who arranged for the gifts.

crank act as cams, raising the flails which then fall to the ground by
gravity. Gift of United States Department of the Interior.

13. Model of Gallic Grain Header, about A.D. 70. USNM 46812; 1906. A
wooden box on wheels, 12 by 5 inches, has metal teeth set at the front
end. Shafts extend to the rear, where an ox is yoked. The forward
movement of the cart causes the grain to lodge against the teeth, which
pulled the heads off. The grain then fell back into the box. Gift of
United States Department of the Interior.

14. Model of Ten Eyck Grain Harvester, 1825. USNM 46812; 1906. Model is
made of wood and iron, 15 inches by 8 inches. Long knives on a drum were
rotated by belt shaft on traveling wheels. Long projecting points
gathered the straw. Iron shafts at the rear allowed animals to be
harnessed to push the machine. James Ten Eyck patented the harvester on
November 2, 1825. Gift of United States Department of the Interior.

15. Model of Manning Grain Harvester, 1831. USNM 46812; 1906. Model of
horse-drawn reaper measures 16 inches by 8 inches, with a wheel diameter
of 6 inches. Projecting iron points at the front end gather the grain,
and vibrating knives, powered from the hob of the wheel, cut the grain.
Patented by William Manning on May 3, 1831. Gift of United States
Department of the Interior.

16. Model of Boyce Grain Harvester, 1799. USNM 46812; 1906. This model,
made of wood and iron, is 15 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 5-1/2
inches high. Six rotating knives radically positioned on a vertical
shaft rotate by level gearing on the wheel axle. The whole is mounted on
a two-wheeled cart with shafts for draft animals. English patent number
2324 granted to James Boyce in 1799. Gift of United States Department of
the Interior.

17. Model of Newbold Plow, 1797. USNM 46812; 1906. This model of a metal
plow, with wooden beam and handles 14 inches long, represents the plow
patented by Charles Newbold on June 26, 1797, the first American patent
for a cast-iron plow. Moldboard, share, and landside were cast in one
piece. If the plow broke, it became totally useless. Not until the parts
were made in separate pieces did the iron plow come into wide use. The
cast iron broke more readily than did the later wrought-iron plows. Gift
of United States Department of the Interior.

18. Winnowing Basket, about 1750. USNM 54513; 1912. Used by the three
Richardson brothers, the first settlers of Woburn, Massachusetts. The
threshed grain could be winnowed in two ways. It could be poured slowly
from the edge of the basket in a breeze, where the heavier grain fell to
the ground while the chaff blew away. More commonly, the farmer tossed
the grain into the air and caught it in the basket, while the chaff blew
away. This rectangular basket measures 50 inches by 30 inches. Gift of
Mrs. Clarissa W. Samson, West Medford, Massachusetts.

(An earlier version of Catalog No. 19.)]

19. Centrifugal Cream Separator, 1914. USNM 56432; 1914. Carl Gustav De
Laval of Sweden invented this successful continuous-flow cream separator
in 1879. Loaned by De Laval Separator Company, New York, New York.

20. Model Tractor, 1919. USNM 64098; 1919. No particular manufacturer
seems represented by this spring-driven toy, which merely represents
tractors of around 1919. The heavy-duty field tractor has four widely
spaced iron wheels. Gift of Toy Manufacturers of the United States, New
York, New York.

21. Model Tractor with Plow, Harrow, and Roller, 1919. USNM 64098; 1919.
Spring-driven, toy tractor. The plow, harrow, and roller, as well as the
tractor itself, represent a typical machine of the period. The product
of no particular firm seems to have been copied. Gift of Toy
Manufacturers of the United States, New York, New York.

22. Meat Grinding Machine, about 1810. USNM 110326; 1930. Hand made of
wood and iron, with six parts held together by two iron bolts. The
cutting edges are set in the sides of a box parallel to each other and
about one-quarter inch apart. A shaft, set in the center of the box, is
turned by a crank. The horizontal shaft has iron slugs, graduated from
coarse to fine, set into the shaft in a helical pattern. The meat enters
through the square hole at the top and the iron teeth press it against
the knife edges; thus, the meat is cut smaller and smaller until it
comes out a small hole in the bottom of the machine. The device is very
ancient in design and could still be found in common use in the United
States as late as 1860. Gift of R. C. Fairhead, Rushville, Nebraska.

23. Carey Plow, about 1815. Received from Division of Ethnology in 1931.
A Carey plow with a slot in the beam for a colter. The landside handle
passes through the beam. Usually, the beam tenon passes through a
mortise in the handle. Possibly made by the farmer. Replication of a
common and popular American plow of the 18th century. Donor not known.

24. Hoe, about 1830. USNM 115122; 1931. Wrought-iron, handmade hoe made
in Ohio and attributed to very early 19th century. The hoe's blade is 5
inches wide and its handle is 6 feet long. Gift of Mrs. Grace M.
Swiggett, Washington, D. C.

25. Reaper Sickle Bar, about 1847. USNM 115878; 1931. Sickle bar from a
McCormick reaper. The blade style suggests a comparatively sophisticated
stage of development, most surely after 1833. David Cromer of Seneca
County, Ohio, used this sickle bar on a McCormick reaper. The blade is 5
feet long and 5 inches deep. Gift of Frank Hepp, Berwick, Ohio.

[Illustration: Figure 3.--Gail Borden's vacuum pan of 1853, used to make
condensed milk. (Catalog No. 26.)]

26. Borden Vacuum Pan, 1853. USNM 119188; 1932. The original vacuum pan
used by Gail Borden in 1853 for condensing milk by concentrating it in a
vacuum. He patented the process on August 19, 1856. Borden borrowed this
pan from nearby Shaker farmers who had used it for canning. Borden did
his early work at New Lebanon, New York. Borden at first failed to get a
patent because the process was not deemed useful. There is nothing
exceptional about this pan except that Borden used it. Gift of Borden
Milk Company, New York, New York.

27. Model of McCormick Reaper, 1834. USNM 121105; 1932. Scale model of
the grain reaper patented by Cyrus McCormick on June 21, 1834. Roderick
Davis constructed the model from the specifications of the patent. Gift
of Charles G. Abbot, Washington, D. C.

28. Model of McCormick Reaper, 1845. USNM 124615; 1933. Scale model of
the reaper patented by Cyrus H. McCormick on January 31, 1845. Roderick
Davis constructed the model from the specifications of United States
patent 3895. Gift of McCormick Historical Association, Chicago,
Illinois.

29. Model of McCormick Reaper, 1847. USNM 124615; 1933. Cyrus McCormick
patented this reaper on October 23, 1847. Roderick Davis built the model
from specifications of United States patent 5335. Gift of McCormick
Historical Association, Chicago, Illinois.

30. Wheeled Plow, 1769. USNM 127755; 1934. Wheeled plow made by Matthew
Thumb in 1769 at Palatine, New York, for Henry Kloch. It has an almost
flat, wooden moldboard; wrought-iron share and colter; a two-wheel truck
in front for the beam; and one handle. The large wheel ran in the furrow
and the small wheel on the land. The wooden parts of the hitch and the
draft chain have been restored. The plow is probably a copy of a German
one. Gift of Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome, London, England.

31. Model of Grain Separator, 1875. USNM 129836; 1934. Working model of
a grain separator for a threshing machine made by Daniel Garver. The
model represents inventions covered by three patents issued to Daniel
and Cyrus Garver: the grain separator, patent 114546, issued May 9,
1871; the fan blast regulator, patent 114547, issued May 9, 1871; and
the bag holding device, patent 161501, issued March 30, 1875. Loaned by
Miss Melchora Garver, Hagerstown, Maryland.

32. Waldron Cradle Blade and Snead, about 1840. USNM 129789; 1934. The
blade has holes for attaching the cradle. The wooden frame, or snead,
supports the cradle fingers, now missing. Gift of Sydney S. Stabler,
Washington, D. C.

33. Settling Can Cream Separator, about 1890. USNM 129789; 1934. Cooley
brand creamer, used for separating milk from cream prior to churning.
The milk and cream were set in a cool place for several hours while the
cream rose to the top. The farmer drew skim milk off through a spigot at
the bottom, after which the cream could be drawn off. Used on farms
before the hand centrifugal separator came into wide use. By 1890, in
butter-producing areas, the centrifugal separator had already caused the
disuse of the Cooley and similar separators. Gift of Sidney S. Stabler,
Washington, D. C.

34. Wooden Hayfork, about 1879. USNM 137459; 1936. Hayfork of
second-growth white oak, made by John Heiss, Lima Township, Lagrange
County, Indiana. It was used for feeding stock and for handling clover
and short straw of all kinds. Gift of E. W. Heiss, Washington, D. C.

35. Wooden Measure, 1845 or earlier. USNM 137960; 1936. Small, round
wooden measure used in 1845 by William Heiss, Lagrange County, Indiana,
to feed small grain or mill feed to livestock. William Heiss was a
grandfather of the donor, E. W. Heiss of Washington, D. C.

36. Half-Bushel Measure, about 1829. USNM 137960; 1936. Made and used by
William Heiss on his farm in Lagrange County, Indiana, about 1829.
Probably used in local barter and trade in such items as beans, corn,
and seeds for various crops. Loaned by E. W. Heiss, Washington, D. C.

[Illustration: Figure 4.--Cotton planter, about 1895. (Catalog No. 37.)]

37. Wooden Drum Cotton Planter, about 1895. USNM 14557; 1937. All wood
except for a duckbill furrow opener in front and two duckbill row
coverers in the rear, both made of metal. The drum of soft wood measures
20 inches in diameter and 13 inches wide. About the center of the drum
is a wooden, metal-rimmed wheel which ran down the furrow, keeping the
seeder on course. Near the wheel, and all around the drum, are 13 evenly
spaced holes through which the cotton seeds fell into the furrow as the
drum revolved. No counting or tripping mechanism was involved, so the
device undoubtedly wasted seed. A mule or a horse pulled the planter and
the farmer walked behind it. James Nelson of Greenwood, South Carolina,
made this planter about 1895. Gift of Ruben F. Vaughn, Honea Path, South
Carolina.

38. Cast-Iron Plow, 1854. USNM 150396; 1938. A cast-iron plow made by
Stephen McCormick of Fauquier County, Virginia, in 1854. The plow
embodies features covered by patents issued to Stephen McCormick on
February 3, 1819, January 28, 1826, and December 1, 1837. Plows of this
type, made chiefly between 1826 and 1850, involved interchangeable
parts. The first patent precedes that of Jethro Wood by seven months,
but the principle of interchangeable parts had been worked out and
patented as early as 1813. Gift of Leander McCormick-Goodhart, Silver
Spring, Md.

39. Mehring's Milking Machine, 1884. USNM 148530; 1938. Original working
model of a hand-powered milking machine built by William M. Mehring in
1884. Mehring subsequently improved and patented the machine in 1892.
The improved machine did not work well because it created continuous
suction for the length of the stroke. The successful application of
intermittent suction, necessary so as not to injure the cow, was worked
out in Scotland in 1902. Gift of Mrs. Bessie D. Mehring, Keymar,
Maryland.

40. Hand-Powered Milking Machine, 1892. USNM 148530; 1938. Practical
hand-pump milking machine designed and built in 1892 by William M.
Mehring, who was granted patent 488282 on December 28, 1892. This
milker, which injured cows when used rapidly, represents an effort to
solve the problem of machine milking, although the use of human power
also limited its usefulness. Gift of Mrs. Bessie D. Mehring, Keymar,
Maryland.

41. Ox Yoke, 1838. USNM 148675; 1938. Edward Scoville (1813-1887) used
this ox yoke when driving an ox cart from Trumbull County, Ohio, to De
Kalb County, Indiana, in 1838. Until well after the Civil War, oxen
pulled most of the wagons going west, and this yoke is typical of all
used in the westward migration, in the North as well as in the South.
Gift of Reign Scoville, Poplar Bluff, Missouri.

[Illustration: Figure 5.--John Deere plow, one of the three plows made
by Deere in 1838. (Catalog No. 42.)]

42. Deere Plow, 1838. USNM 148904; 1938. John Deere made this plow, with
steel share and polished wrought-iron moldboard, at Grand Detour,
Illinois, in 1838. Joseph Brierton bought it and used it on his farm,
and the Deere Company obtained it in 1901. It is one of three plows made
by John Deere in 1838, and presumably it is identical to his first steel
share plow, made in 1837 at Grand Detour. Called the singing plow, it
proved especially effective in prairie country after the sod had been
broken because the earth did not adhere to the share and moldboard. The
implement could also be used as a breaking plow. Gift of Deere and
Company, Moline, Illinois.

43. Model of Sulky Plow, 1899. USNM 156653; 1940. Working model of the
Hy-Lift sulky plow invented by Niels O. Starks of Madison, Wisconsin,
and made by the Fuller and Johnson Company around 1900. Starks received
patent 616984 on January 3, 1899. The land wheel on this plow
automatically raises and lowers the plow at the end of a furrow. Gift of
S. O. Strucksberg, St. Joseph, Missouri.

44. Barbed Ribbon Wire, 1879. USNM 159858; 1941. Specimen of barbed wire
made with saw teeth cut out of twisted ribbon wire. Gift of B. F.
Arthur, Winchester, Virginia.

45. Chinese Plow, date unknown. USNM 161555; 1941. This primitive,
one-handled plow has an iron hook on the end of the beam. Apparently it
had an iron shoe for a share, which is now missing. This style of plow
is typical of the kind used in rice-growing sections of China. Gift of
United States Department of Agriculture.

46. Carey Plow, about 1820. USNM 161555; 1941. The share and landside of
this small cultivating plow are in one piece of wrought iron with
sockets for the left handle and the standard bar share. It has a flat
wooden moldboard. Used in Northumberland County, Virginia, until 1855 or
1860, for cultivating corn and other row crops. Gift of United States
Department of Agriculture.

47. Plow, about 1790. USNM 161555; 1941. Only the share, colter, and
beam of this plow are original, the rest having been reconstructed. The
original parts came from Northumberland County, Virginia. Gift of Edwin
Brown, Brown's Store, Virginia.

48. Old Colony Strong Plow, 1740. USNM 161555; 1941. The moldboard of
this plow is made of wood and covered with thick pieces of iron. The
plow has a lock colter and wrought-iron share fitted on the end of a
wooden beam. Pelatiah Kinsman of Ipswich, Massachusetts, had the plow
made in 1740. It represents the New England open-drawn plows of that
time. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.

49. Old Colony Plow, 1783. USNM 161555; 1941. This plow resembles the
Old Colony Strong Plow (No. 48) but it is not as large and the moldboard
is covered with uniform, narrow iron straps. Farmers used this plow for
cross-plowing after initial breaking by the Strong Plow and for
cultivating. It probably was drawn by oxen. John Foster, a corporal in
the Revolutionary Army, had this implement made at Ipswich,
Massachusetts, in 1783. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.

50. Tavenner Plow, between 1810 and 1860. USNM 161555; 1941. The
Tavenner plow has a cast-iron moldboard and a wrought-iron share and
colter. Plows of this type were made and used widely in Loudon County,
Virginia. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.

51. Smith Plow, about 1800. USNM 161555; 1941. This sod-turning plow has
its landside, moldboard, and colter in separate pieces. It was built on
the lines of a plow patented by Robert Smith in 1800. Gift of United
States Department of Agriculture.

52. Gideon Davis Plow, about 1825. USNM 161555; 1941. Gideon Davis
received a patent in 1825 for his improvements of the Newbold plow
patented in 1797. In tests in 1825 to determine the efficiency of
different plows, the Davis plow took first place in a competition with
five others. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.

53. Woodcock Plow, about 1848. USNM 161555; 1941. The Woodcock plow has
separate landside, moldboard, share, cutter, and point. This plow has
the first reversible point. Woodcock plows were first used in 1847, in
Maryland. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.

[Illustration: Figure 6.--Eagle plow, about 1849. (Catalog No. 54.)]

54. Eagle Plow, 1849. USNM 161555; 1941. The Number 25 Eagle Plow, which
first appeared in the catalog of the J. Nourse Company in 1849, became
the standard plow of New England after the middle of the 19th century.
Its moldboard was based on a design worked out by Thomas Jefferson. Gift
of United States Department of Agriculture.

55. Mexican Plow, about 1890. USNM 161555; 1941. This Mexican bull
tongue plow has an iron shoe on the point and it closely resembles
Spanish plows of the 16th century. It was intended to be pulled by an ox
and to break the soil for only three or four inches at the most. Gift
of United States Department of Agriculture.

56. Butcher's Saw, 1879. USNM 130572; 1942. This saw is part of a set of
butcher's tools (Nos. 56-67) presented to William H. Hoover by the

[Illustration: Figure 7.--Babcock butterfat tester, about 1895. (Catalog
No. 68.)]

68. Babcock Butterfat Tester, about 1895. USNM 173353; 1946. A machine
used in determining the amount of butterfat in milk or cream. The
Vermont Farm Machine Company of Bellows Falls, Vermont, made the
centrifuge, which mixed sulphuric acid with the milk in order to
produce a reading of the amount of butterfat tested. The Brighton Farm
at Patuxent River, Montgomery County, Maryland, used this machine around
1895. Stephen M. Babcock developed this tester in 1890 and released it
to the public, without patent, in 1891. The device had far-reaching
effects in the dairy industry, because for the first time it allowed
accurate payment to farmers for the actual amount of butterfat in their
milk; also, it allowed farmers to test their cows to discover which ones
produced the most butterfat. Gift of Sidney S. Stabler, Hyattsville,
Maryland.

69. Buggy Rake, 1840. USNM 175393; 1947. The buggy rake harvested grain
after it had been cut with a cradle. The rake has handles and a wheel,
like a wheelbarrow, with long wooden tines in front to scoop up the
grain. When the binder stepped on a bar at the back of the buggy the
tines would move up and allow the grain to slide back against the
uprights in a convenient position for binding. Although it undoubtedly
reduced the physical labor of binding, this rake would not have been
very efficient and would have allowed the reaper to get far ahead of
the binder. Gift of F. B. Day, Owosso, Michigan.

70. Model of Plow, about 1885. USNM 179841; 1949. The model has a share,
standard, and moldboard of metal with a gauge wheel on the beam. The
beam pivots on the standard, allowing adjustments of the angle of draft.
The end of the beam is fastened to a brace which extends to the back of
the moldboard. The share and point are in one piece; and the moldboard
is one piece. The model resembles the plows of James Oliver, which by
1885 had been widely known and were quite possibly copied. Donor
unknown.

71. Diorama of Tropical Banana Plantation, late 19th century. USNM
186623; 1950. The diorama shows bananas being harvested and trees being
cut. The banana bunches get to the railroad cars on burros. At the
bottom, bananas are shown in various stages of growth and ripening. Gift
of United Fruit Company, Washington, D. C.

72. Diorama of Tropical Coffee Plantation, late 19th century. USNM
186553; 1950. The diorama shows coffee berries being dried in the sun
and in the shade in preparation for marketing the coffee. At the bottom,
various stages of growth and ripening of the coffee berries are
depicted. Gift of The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A & P),
New York, New York.

73. Food-Slicing Machine, mid 19th century. USNM 188878; 1950. Cutting
knives, set in helix in a wooden axle, move the meat through the box,
cutting it finer and finer. Gift of George Murphy, Washington, D. C.

74. Fanning Mill, about 1860. USNM 192872; 1951. A hand-crank operated
the winnowing mill for separating grain from chaff and beans from hulls.
A four-blade, wooden fan, shaped like a paddle wheel, blows a draft
below oscillating screens. The chaff is blown off from the threshed
grain, and the grain or beans fall from the screens into the path of the
draft. The screens catch any straw left after threshing. Gift of Arden
Wilson, Harrisville, West Virginia.

[Illustration: Figure 8.--Two-row corn planter, about 1854. (Catalog No.
75.)]

75. Two-Row Corn Planter, about 1854. USNM 193259; 1952. This
hand-operated planter, of a type patented by S. Malone on January 3,
1854, was sold by William M. Plant, a dealer in seeds, tools, and
machines at St. Louis, Missouri. When the planter was dropped to the
ground, the two handles moved about 8 inches in a slot toward the
outside. This movement opened a space for the corn to drop into the
shoe, where a small piece of wood opened and the corn fell to the
ground. Gift of Warren Hammond, Fayette, Missouri.

76. Model of Ferguson Tractor, 1952. USNM 193939; 1952. This plastic and
metal model of a Ferguson tractor operates a Ferguson hitch. Gift of

has a bit with three tines. This style spade was invented around 1895
and was widely used for digging trenches for drain tiles on sticky or
mucky soil. The Osmundson Forge Company of Webster City, Iowa, made
these spades as late as 1952. Gift of A. G. Osmundson, Webster City,
Iowa.

82. Glass Churn, about 1900. USNM 193941; 1952. This German-made churn,
of 4-liter capacity, has a hand crank which drives a metal propeller at
the bottom in one direction while paddles on the shaft turn in the other
direction. Gift of A. G. Osmundson, Webster City, Iowa.

83. Cedar Sap Spouts, about 1800. USNM 194893; 1952. Sap spouts, made
of cedar, about 15 inches long. Spouts like these were made and used by
settlers of upper New York about 1800 to gather the maple sap after the
trees had been tapped. Gift of Frank E. Olmstead, Potsdam, New York.

84. Cedar Sap Spouts, about 1800. USNM 194893; 1952. Sap spouts for
maple tree tapping, about 15 inches long and made of cedar. The maple
syrup and sugar industry provided some income for frontier farms, as
well as providing sugar for domestic use. Although maple syrup often
sold at high prices, the industry never achieved major importance even
in the localities where it flourished. These spouts are of the sort used
in the pioneer period in New York. (See also Nos. 83, 85-87.) Gift of
Frank E. Olmstead, Potsdam, New York.

85. Iron Sap Spout, possibly late 19th century. USNM 194893; 1952. A
cast-iron maple sap spout, about 3 inches long, used for gathering the
sap into buckets. Possibly factory-made and used later than the frontier
period, after maple syrup manufacture had become a commercial
enterprise. The leading areas for maple syrup have long been Ohio, New
York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Gift of Frank E. Olmstead, Potsdam,
New York.

86. Iron Sap Spout, possibly late 19th century. USNM 194893; 1952. A
thin, metal trough, plated, and about 3 inches long, used to convey
maple sap from the tap in the tree to the sap bucket. This is the type
spout most commonly used today in those areas where farmers supplement
their income with maple syrup production. Gift of Frank E. Olmstead,
Potsdam, New York.

87. Sap Bucket Spikes, possibly late 19th century. USNM 194893; 1952.
Hand-made iron spikes used to hold buckets for maple tree sap. They had
to be hooked somewhat so the bucket could hang on them well. Gift of
Frank E. Olmstead, Potsdam, New York.

88. Diagram of Jefferson Moldboard, 1798. USNM 198605; 1953. A
three-dimensional wire diagram, at half scale, illustrating Thomas
Jefferson's design of a plow mold-board as he described it in a letter
to Sir John Sinclair in 1798. In the same year Jefferson read a paper to
the American Philosophical Society that was titled "Description of a
Mold-Board of the Least Resistance and of the Easiest and Most Certain
Design." The wire diagram was constructed by the Division of Crafts and
Industries, Smithsonian Institution.

89. Model of Jefferson Moldboard, 1798. USNM 198605; 1953. The model
consists of four separate blocks of wood cut to show the progressive
steps in the construction of the Jefferson moldboard: (1) the block of
wood marked for sawing with the rear section cut out, and in two parts;
(2) the block of wood sawed on two diagonals, with the rear section cut
out, and in three parts; (3) the block of wood sawed transversely on
guide lines down to the diagonals, with the wood between the transverse
cuts removed and leaving the face of the moldboard roughly shaped; (4)
the rear surface of the board produced in the same manner as the front,
resulting in a completed moldboard. The models were constructed by the
Division of Crafts and Industries, Smithsonian Institution, after
Jefferson's original moldboard, located at the Natural History Museum,
Paris, France.

90. Wooden Curd Breaker, about 1860. USNM 198617; 1953. This curd
breaker is made of wood with iron pegs in the cylinder and hopper. Gift
of Laurence Hathaway, Easton, Maryland.

91. Grain Cradle, about 1844. USNM 198620; 1953. Caleb Paul Duval used
this cradle on his Glen Echo farm near Baltimore, Maryland. Gift of
Virginia Duval, College Park, Maryland.

92. Barrel Churn, about 1860. USNM 198620; 1953. A wooden barrel churn
with iron crank and paddles. Such churns were of too small volume to be
used on commercial dairy farms, and they were not at all useful in
creameries, which first appeared in 1861. Gift of Virginia Duval,
College Park, Maryland.

93. Cookie Roller, about 1860. USNM 198620; 1953. A wooden, grooved,
one-handled cookie roller, about 14-1/2 inches long and about 3-1/4
inches in diameter. The roller added an esthetic touch to home-made
cookies but was of little importance in the history of commercial food
processing. Gift of Virginia Duval, College Park, Maryland.

94. Meat Grinder, 1859. USNM 198620; 1953. This iron, hand-cranked meat
grinder was patented August 2, 1859. Gift of Virginia Duval, College
Park, Maryland.

95. Butter Prints, about 1860. USNM 198620; 1953. Two butter prints. One
is circular, with a tri-lobed leaf design and about 3 inches in
diameter; the other is a box mold with two five-point star designs and
about 5 inches long, 2-1/2 inches wide, and 4 inches high. The butter
was pressed into these molds before being served, or, sometimes, before
being rolled in paper and sold in towns. This aspect of farm dairying
quickly disappeared after the creamery dominated the industry. Gift of
Virginia Duval, College Park, Maryland.

96. Shoe Last, possibly mid 19th century. USNM 196820; 1953. A small
last, to fit either foot, for a shoe about 8-3/4 inches long and 2-1/4
inches wide. Such implements were useful in frontier communities and
generally were owned by itinerant cobblers who went from house to house.
Gift of Virginia Duval, College Park, Maryland.

97. Model of Fanning Mill, 1857. USNM 198620; 1953. This is a working
model of a fanning mill invented by Joseph and James Montgomery and
covered by patents 10324, issued in 1853; 13062, issued in 1855; and
16447, issued in 1857. The crank handle and the slide, which governed
the flow into the hopper, are missing. James Montgomery took the model
on sales trips as a demonstrator. Gift of Ruth Montgomery, Peoria,
Illinois.

98. Model of McCormick Reaper, 1831. USNM 121526; 1953. A scale model of
the 1831 reaper of Cyrus McCormick, built long afterwards from
descriptions by the inventor. Gift of McCormick Historical Association,
Chicago, Illinois.

99. Bee Colony, 1953 (renewed yearly). A 3-story bee hive with about
60,000 bees. The hive was designed by experts at the Department of
Agriculture Research Station, Beltsville, Maryland. The United States
Department of Agriculture donated the hive and the Italian bees.

100. Model of Ox-Powered Sugar Cane Mill, 1925. USNM 200380; 1954. Model
of a mill of a type used in Puerto Rico as early as 1523. It took ten
men and four yoke of oxen to operate the mill, which could crush about
four tons of cane in a 12-hour day. This type of mill extracted about 40
to 45 percent syrup based on the weight of the cane, compared to 80 to
85 percent extracted by modern mills. Gift of Daniel Thompson,
Petersburg, Virginia.

101. Model of Water-Lifting Wheel, 1884. USNM 200380; 1954. A model of a
wind-driven waterwheel used for raising water into the evaporating beds
in salt works. This type of device lifted water from the ocean in Puerto
Rico. Gift of Daniel Thompson, Petersburg, Virginia.

102. Model of Grist Mill, 1883. USNM 200380; 1954. This model of a
water-powered grist mill resembles those used throughout America in the
19th century before the discovery of the gradual reduction process and
the consequent centralization of the milling industry. This particular
mill, known to have operated from 1883 to 1940, ground corn in Puerto
Rico. Gift of Daniel Thompson, Petersburg, Virginia.

103. Farm Copybook, about 1840. USNM 209042; 1955. Wells Forbes, who had
a farm near Alexandria, Virginia, kept this book for about a year in the
1840s. Gift of Bessie W. Palm, Washington, D. C.

clips, each different, denoting a brand for labeling tobacco. Gift of
Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C.

111. Bar Share Plow, 1807. USNM 214608; 1957. A left-handed wooden
moldboard plow. Most American plows cast the furrow to the right. The
Reverend Christian Lesher brought this rare sort of plow from Lancaster
County, Pennsylvania, to Washington Township, Pennsylvania, in 1807.
Gift of Daniel Lesher, Waynesboro, Pennsylvania.

[Illustration: Figure 11.--Sausage stuffer, early 19th century. (Catalog
No. 112.)]

112. Sausage Stuffer, about 1820. USNM 213816; 1957. This hand-lever
sausage stuffer, mounted on a bench, may have been made in England in
the early 19th century and later brought to Brampton, Ontario. Not all
parts are of the same age. The replaced parts seem to be those most
subject to wear and tear. This style sausage stuffer was quite common in
the 18th and 19th centuries. Gift of Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.

113. Meat Grinder, about 1830. USNM 312816; 1957. A hand-cranked meat
grinder made of wood with iron slugs to push the meat against stationary
knives. Overall, 14 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 10 inches high.
Gift of Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.

114. Sausage Stuffer, early 19th century. USNM 213816; 1957. This
hand-cranked sausage stuffer, made of wood and with an iron screw, fits
on a small bench with lard press. It is 20 inches long, 8-1/2 inches
wide, and 11 inches high. Gift of Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.

115. Lard Press, late 19th century. USNM 213816; 1957. A lard press made
of cylindrical perforated metal, with a screw press to be mounted on a
small bench. The press is 11 inches in diameter and 10 inches high. The
bench is about a yard long, 8 inches wide, and 18 inches high. Gift of
Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.

116. Butcher's Table, late 19th century. USNM 213816; 1957. A heavy, low
table made of two thick slabs of wood with a gutter cut along the edges
of the table. Used in cutting up animal carcasses. Some 6 feet long, 34
inches wide, and 24-1/2 inches high. Gift of Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois.

117. Chopping Bowl, late 19th century. USNM 213816; 1957. Elliptical
wooden chopping bowl, some 30 inches long, 17-1/2 inches wide, and 7
inches high. Gift of Tee-Pak, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.

118. Thresher, about 1855. USNM 214890; 1957. A threshing machine marked
"J. and P. Flickinger, Hanover, Pa., No. 41." It once had a drive for a
vibrating straw separator. Gift of James W. Brown, Brookeville,
Maryland.

119. Grain Cradle, about 1870. USNM 214890; 1957. A grain cradle made at
Brighton, Maryland, by William Nickerson, Jr. The cradle fingers are of
ash, and the braces of hickory. This type of cradle continued in use in
many places even after the advent of harvesting machinery. Farmers with
only small acreages in bread grains or who farmed rough or hilly soil
could not effectively use the reapers and harvester of the middle 19th
century. Gift of James W. Brown, Brookeville, Maryland.

120. Binder's Rake, about 1870. USNM 214890; 1957. The binder followed
the cradler. This hand rake, used by the binder for gathering the grain
before binding and later shocking, had teeth rived out of hickory. Such
a rake could also be used by a binder who followed those the early
reapers used before the invention of the twine binder. Gift of James W.
Brown, Brookeville, Maryland.

[Illustration: Figure 12.--Harpoon hayforks. (Catalog Nos. 121, 123.)]

121. Harpoon Hayfork, late 19th century. USNM 214890; 1957. A
double-harpoon hayfork and pulley for lifting hay from a wagon to a barn
hayloft. Power was supplied by horse or mule. The small barbs on the
harpoon could catch and hold a surprising amount of hay. Gift of James
W. Brown, Brookeville, Maryland.

122. Grain Sack, 1842. USNM 214608; 1957. A grain sack of homespun linen
made from flax grown on the John Lesher farm near Waynesboro,
Pennsylvania. Woven at a roadside mill, the sack has a capacity of three
bushels and is marked "John Lesher, No. 26, 1842." Prior to the advent
of and widespread use of the elevator system of grain handling, nearly
all grain was moved in sacks that had to be shifted about by hand and
stored in warehouses. The elevator system began in Buffalo, New York, in
1842, but reached a position of prominence only in the 1870s when it
began flourishing in Chicago and Milwaukee. Thereafter the grain sack
became virtually a curiosity. Gift of James W. Brown, Brookeville,
Maryland.

123. Single-Harpoon Hayfork, about 1895. USNM 216224; 1957. A hay
harpoon, commonly called a hay needle, about 35-1/2 inches long. Gift of
Cora E. Robinson, Schenectady, New York.

124. Tractor Engine Starter, 1930. USNM 218874; 1958. The starting
device could be bolted to the rear wheel hub of an automobile. An
extendible shaft went from the wheel-fitting to the crank on the
tractor. The car engine then could turn over the tractor engine. The
starter was made by C. O. Goodrich, who marketed it for about eight
years in five midwestern states. Self starters on tractors eventually
ended the need for the device. Gift of C. O. Goodrich, Plymouth,
Indiana.

125. Fordson Crank, about 1925. USNM 218874; 1958. This device was used
to crank the engine on Fordson tractors. Gift of C. O. Goodrich,
Plymouth, Indiana.

126. Milking Machine, 1896. USNM 220004; 1958. A Mehring foot-powered
milking machine. Gift of Earl J. Waybright, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

127. Carey Plow, about 1800. USNM 220005; 1958. A type of plow widely
used in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the United States.
This particular plow was a one-horse, single-bottom, walking type, with
wooden handles, beam, stock, and moldboard. The share point is of iron.
All wooden joints are joined with wooden pegs. There is a bolt-type
brace from beam to stock and a small iron brace with a larger wooden
brace between the handles. Gift of International Harvester Co., Albany,
New York.

128. Hoe, possibly mid 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. Only the blade
remains of this socket-type hoe. Gift of New York Historical
Association, Cooperstown, New York.

129. Log Roller, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. Oxen drew this
roller in preparing seed beds. The roller crushed clods and compressed
the soil, leaving a firm, compact seed bed. It was useful, obviously,
only on certain types of soil in fairly humid areas. The roller is made
of four log sections, each 23 inches long and 14 inches in diameter. The
logs are set in a weighted frame measuring 35 inches by 9 feet, with a
tongue about 13 feet long. Gift of New York Historical Association,
Cooperstown, New York.

130. Grain Cradle, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. A form of
scythe used for harvesting grain before the reaper came into use, or
used in places where the reaper proved uneconomical or technologically
inappropriate, as rough or hilly land. This specimen has four wooden
fingers, or tines, that are 45 inches long and spaced 7 inches apart.
The blade is 2 inches wide and as long as the fingers. Gift of New York
Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

131. Self-Rake Reaper, 1895. USNM 213356; 1958. A McCormick Daisy Reaper
of 1895 in which the operator sat on a seat mounted on the axle of the
left wheel. Two horses drew the reaper. Three rotating arms with 3-inch
projections raked, bound and shocked the grain. The cutter bar, over 5
feet long, has three triangular sickle blades which oscillate through
the guard teeth, as in Hussey or modern cutter bars. Gift of New York
Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

132. Barley Fork, possibly late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. A
rectangular wooden barley fork with a one-eighth-inch-gauge wire guard
for holding the barley on the four tines. The guard was needed because
of the nasty stings that the beard could give the worker. Gift of New
York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

133. Brush Hook, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. A typical iron
sickle, called a hook because of its general shape. It has a circular
tip on the end of the blade so that it could be used for cutting brush.
Gift of New York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

134. Fanning Mill, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. An early
fanning mill with pulley and leather belt. Gift of New York Historical
Association, Cooperstown, New York.

135. Scythe, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. A crooked-handled
scythe used for cutting grain before the cradle, and thereafter for
cutting hay. Gift of New York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New
York.

[Illustration: Figure 13.--Flop-over hay rake. (Catalog No. 136.)]

136. Flop-Over Hay Rake, about 1895. USNM 213356; 1958. A rake for
piling hay that would be carried from the field or put into a mow. This
sort of implement was used as early as 1820. The farmer walked behind
the horse-drawn rake and raised the handle when the rake was full; this
caused the double set of teeth to revolve, releasing the hay in a pile
and putting the second set of teeth into position to rake more hay. The
older method involved using small hand rakes and required considerable
time and effort in a very disagreeable task. Gift of New York Historical
Association, Cooperstown, New York.

137. Victor Mowing Machine, 1880. USNM 213356; 1958. A one-horse,
front-cut mowing machine similar to the Buckeye mower. The cutter bar
can be raised and lowered parallel to the ground for desired cutting
heights, and it can be lifted and fastened in an upright position for
transport to and from the field. Mowers cut more rapidly and lower than
did reapers, and thus they used a different gear ratio; however, farmers
sometimes used reapers for mowing. Gift of New York Historical
Association, Cooperstown, New York.

138. Spring-Tooth Hay Rake, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958. A
sulky rake with spring teeth designed to jump over obstructions in the
field. Gift of New York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

139. "Railway Horse Power," about 1885. USNM 213356; 1958. A
horse-powered treadmill made chiefly of wood, with metal parts where the
wear would be greatest. It was used to produce power for belt-driven
equipment such as threshers or fanning mills. The machine is set in
motion by putting a horse in the pen and releasing the brake. The weight
of the horse causes the slats to move endlessly, which in turn rotates
the belting wheel. Two-horse treadmills also were used, but such
machines, although portable, worked less efficiently than the
sweep-power machines. This treadmill was made in Vermont. Gift of New
York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.

[Illustration: Figure 14.--Dog-powered churn, 1881. (Catalog No. 140.)]

140. Dog-Powered Churn, 1881. USNM 213356; 1958. H. M. Childs of Utica,
New York, patented this dog-powered churn in 1871, with improvements
patented in 1881. A dog, tied or strapped into the pen, ran forward and
so moved the slats of the treadmill which in turn rotated a flywheel.
Attached to the flywheel is a pitman rod which raises and lowers a churn
dasher. Devices of this sort had appeared earlier for use in the
farm-dairy industry. The change of direction effected by the pitman rod
caused some loss of energy; in any case, a revolving barrel-churn proved
more efficient in the long run. Gift of New York Historical Association,
Cooperstown, New York.

141. Winnowing Basket, about 1800. USNM 213356; 1958. The winnowing
basket was used to work off the chaff from the threshed grain. When the
grain was tossed into the air, the wind would blow away the chaff and
the grain would fall back into the basket. Sometimes the grain would be
poured from another basket into a winnowing basket, with the wind doing
the winnowing. Gift of New York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New
York.

[Illustration: Figure 15.--Avery Bulldog tractor, about 1919. (Catalog
No. 142.)]

142. Avery Bulldog Tractor, 1919. USNM 222860; 1958. This is one of the
several makes of tractors which set a trend toward lighter tractors
about the time of World War I. It was designed for light field work such
as cultivating but could also be used for belt drive. It developed 5 to
10 horsepower. Sold by Everett Noirot, Freehold, New York.

143. Grain Cradle, about 1870. USNM 230323; 1958. This grain cradle
resembles a scythe, with modification by the addition of a light wooden
frame of four fingers with braces. Gift of Massachusetts Society for
Promoting Agriculture.

144. Scythe, about 1840. USNM 230323; 1958. A straight-handled scythe,
probably hand-made, that largely was used for mowing, although it could
be used for reaping grain. Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting
Agriculture.

145. Harness Vise, probably mid 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. This
wooden device could be used to pry open the jaws of a recalcitrant
horse. More often, it held parts of the harness as the saddler worked.
Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.

146. Wooden Hand Fork, late 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. A wooden
pitchfork for handling hay, straw, and the like. The metal pitchfork
gradually replaced these wooden forks between the middle and end of the
19th century. Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.

147. Horse-Drawn Hayfork, late 19th century. USNM 230323; 1959. The fork
was driven into the hay and the handle compressed until it latched. A
rope was attached to the fork, run up over a pully in the barn, and
then down to a horse. In this way the hay could be lifted into the barn.
Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.

148. Horse-Drawn Planter, 1856. USNM 230323; 1958. E. C. Fairchild of
Deerfield, Massachusetts, made this planter, which has compartments for
seeds and fertilizer. As the drive-wheel pulled a sliding bar back and
forth, seeds and fertilizer alternately dropped into the ground. The
spacing of seeds and fertilizer could be set by adjusting the metal bar.
Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.

149. Fanning Mill, mid 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. A machine for
winnowing grain after it had been threshed. Grain fed into the machine
landed on vibrating screens which permitted the kernels to fall into the
path of a draft of air which blew off the chaff and debris. The clean
grain fell into a container beneath the mill. The operator turned a
crank which operated both the screens and the fan. Gift of Massachusetts
Society for Promoting Agriculture.

150. Hoe, mid 19th century. USNM 230322; 1958. A small hand hoe used for
cultivating. Gift of Farmer's Museum, Hadley, Massachusetts.

151. Tile Knife, late 19th century. USNM 230322; 1958. This knife,
resembling a small spade, was used to cut the trench in which tile was
laid. It has a triangular metal cutter at right angles on the right
side, and this gave the trench a straight edge on one side and perhaps
helped keep the trench straight. Gift of Farmer's Museum, Hadley,
Massachusetts.

developed in 1925 by the Department of Agriculture as an aid in
estimating the acreage of cotton in Mississippi. The crop meter was
attached to the dashboard of an automobile and connected by cable to the
odometer. A circuitous route was followed through the cotton area, and
when the driver came to the edge of a cotton field he pushed a button
which started the meter measuring the frontage of the field. The total
mileage registered could be interpreted in terms of the acreage. The
meter method was later replaced by aerial observation. Gift of

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
