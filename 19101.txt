ACT I


_A charming room in the Tillmans' house. The walls are white woodwork,
  framing in old tapestries of deep foliage design, with here and there
  a flaming flamingo; white furniture with old, green brocade cushions.
  The room is in the purest Louis XVI. The noon sunlight streams through
  a window on the left. On the opposite side is a door to the hall. At
  back double doors open into a corridor which leads to the ballroom.
  At left centre are double doors to the front hall. A great, luxurious
  sofa is at the left, with chairs sociably near it, and on the other
  side of the room a table has chairs grouped about it. On floral small
  table are books and objets d'art, and everywhere there is a profusion
  of white roses and maidenhair fern._

_In the stage directions Left and Right mean Left and Right of actor,
  as he faces audience._

_Three smart-looking SERVANTS are peering through the crack of the
  folding door, their backs to the audience. The pretty, slender MAID
  is on a chair. The elderly BUTLER dignifiedly stands on the floor.
  The plump, overfed little HOUSEMAID is kneeling so as to see beneath
  the head of the BUTLER._


HOUSEMAID. [_Gasping._] Oh, ain't it a beautiful sight!

BUTLER. [_Pompously._] Not to me who 'ave seen a Lord married in
Hengland.

MAGGIE. Oh, you make me sick, Mr. Potts, always talking of your English
Aristocracy! I'm sure there never was no prettier wedding than this. Nor
as pretty a bride as Miss Jinny.

BUTLER. [_Correcting her._] Mrs. Haustin!

HOUSEMAID. She looks for all the world like one of them frosted angels
on a Christmas card. My, I wish I could 'a' seen her go up the aisle
with the organ going for all it was worth!

MAGGIE. It was a _beautiful_ sight!

BUTLER. A good many 'appens to be 'aving the sense to be going now.

HOUSEMAID. Could you hear Miss Jinny say "I do," and make them other
remarks?

MAGGIE. Yes, _plain_, though her voice was trembly like. But Mr. Austin
he almost shouted!

  [_Laughing nervously in excitement._

BUTLER. 'E's glad to get 'er!

MAGGIE. _And her him!_

HOUSEMAID. Yes, that's what I likes about it. Did any one cry?

MAGGIE. Mrs. Tillman. Lots of people are going now.

HOUSEMAID. What elegant clothes! Oh, gosh!

BUTLER. [_Superciliously._] Mrs. Cullingham don't seem in no 'urry;
she's a common lot!

MAGGIE. I don't care, she's rich and Miss Jinny likes her; she just
throws money around to any poor person or church or hospital that wants
it, or _don't_! So she can't be so _very common_ neither, Mr. Potts!

HOUSEMAID. Say, I catch on to something! Young Mr. Tillman's sweet on
that there tall bridesmaid.

MAGGIE. [_Sharply._] Who?

BUTLER. Miss Chester. I've seen there was something goin' hon between
them whenever she's dined or lunched 'ere.

MAGGIE. [_Angry._] 'Tain't true!

BUTLER. I'll bet my month's wages.

MAGGIE. I don't believe you!

BUTLER. Why, what's it to _you_, please?

MAGGIE. [_Saving herself._] Nothing--

HOUSEMAID. Well, I guess it's truth enough. That's the second time I've
seen him squeeze her hand when no one wasn't lookin'.

MAGGIE. Here, change places with me! [_Getting down from her chair._]
If you was a gentleman, Mr. Potts, you'd have given me _your place_!

  [_Witheringly._

BUTLER. If I was a _gentleman_, miss, I wouldn't be here; _I'd_ be on
the other side of the door.

  [_He moves the chairs away._

MAGGIE. [_To Housemaid._] Honest, you saw something between them?

HOUSEMAID. Who?

MAGGIE. Him and her? Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Chester--

HOUSEMAID. _Cheese it!_ they're coming this way!

  [_She and the MAID and the BUTLER vanish through the door Right._

  [_GEOFFREY and RUTH enter through the double doors quickly at back.
  GEOFFREY is a young, good-looking man, but with a weak face. He is of
  course very smartly dressed. RUTH is a very serenely beautiful girl,
  rather noble in type, but unconscious and unpretending in manner.
  They close the doors quickly behind them._

GEOFFREY. We'll not be interrupted here, and I must have a few words
with you before you go.

  [_He follows her to the sofa where she sits, and leans over it, with
  his arm about her shoulder._

RUTH. Oh, Geof,--Geof, why weren't we married like this?

GEOFFREY. It couldn't be helped, darling!

RUTH. It isn't the big wedding I miss, oh, no, it's only it seemed
sweeter in a church. Why did we have to steal off to Brooklyn, to that
poor, strange little preacher in his stuffy back parlour, and behave as
if we were doing something of which we were ashamed?

GEOFFREY. You love me, I love you,--isn't that the chief thing, dearest?

RUTH. But how much longer must we keep it secret?

GEOFFREY. Till I can straighten my affairs out. I can't explain it all
to you; there are terrible debts,--one more than all the others,--a debt
I made when I was in college.

RUTH. If I could only help you! I have a _little_ money.

GEOFFREY. No, I love you too much; besides, this debt isn't _money_,
and I hope to get rid of it somehow before long.

RUTH. Forgive me for worrying you. It is only that every one is so happy
at this wedding except me,--dear Jinny brimming over with joy, as I
would be,--and it's made me feel--a little--

GEOFFREY. [_Comes around the sofa and sits beside her._] I know, dear,
and it's made me feel what a brute I am! Oh, if you knew how I hate
myself for all I've done, and for the pain and trouble I cause you now!

  [_MAGGIE, her sharp features set tense, appears in the doorway on the
  left behind the curtains and listens._

RUTH. Never mind, we won't think of that any more.

GEOFFREY. I can never throw it off, not for a minute! I'm a worthless
fellow and how can you love me--

RUTH. [_Interrupting him._] I _do_! You are worth everything to me, and
you will be worth much to the world yet!

GEOFFREY. I love you, Ruth--that's the one claim I can make to deserve
you. But it's helped me to give up _all_ the beastly pleasures I used to
indulge in!

RUTH. [_Softly._] Geof!

GEOFFREY. Which I used to think the only things worth living for, and
which now, thanks to you, I loathe,--every one of them.

RUTH. I'm so glad! I've been some help, then.

GEOFFREY. If I'd only got you earlier, I'd have been a different man,
Ruth!

RUTH. [_Smiling and taking his nervous hand in hers._] Then I mightn't
have fallen in love with you if you were a _different_ man!

GEOFFREY. Dear girl! Anyway, this is the good news that I want to tell
you--I hope now to have things settled in a couple of weeks.

RUTH. [_In glad relief._] Geoffrey!

GEOFFREY. But--I mayn't be successful; it might be, Ruth--it might be,
we would have to wait--for years--

RUTH. [_Quietly._] I don't think I could bear that! It's not easy for me
to lie and deceive as I've had to the last few months; I don't think I
could keep it up.

  [_PETER CULLINGHAM enters suddenly, from the ballroom, a pale young
  man, but, unlike GEOFFREY, hard and virile._

PETER. Oh, here you are! I say, are you two spoony? Just the way _I_
feel! [_Laughing._] I caught and hugged old Mrs. Parmby just now! I
think it's sort of in the air at weddings, don't you?

GEOFFREY. [_Rising._] I'm surprised to see you've left the refreshment
table, Peter.

PETER. They sent me to find Miss Chester--they're going to cut the
bridesmaid's cake, and if you two really are spoony, Miss Chester, you'd
better not miss it--you might get the ring!

  [_They laugh as PETER takes out a bottle from which he takes a round,
  black tablet which he puts in his mouth._

RUTH. [_Also rising._] I'd better go.

  [_PETER is making frantic efforts to swallow the tablet._

GEOFFREY. [_Noticing him._] What's the matter with you?

PETER. O dear! I've eaten so many ices and fancy cakes, I've got awful
indigestion, and I'm trying to swallow a charcoal tablet.

RUTH. Come with me and get a glass of water.

PETER. No, it's very bad to drink water with your meals; but I'll get a
piece of bridesmaid's cake--that'll push it down!

  [_PETER and RUTH go out through the double doors._

  [_The moment they are out of the room, MAGGIE comes from behind the
  curtain and goes straight up to GEOFFREY. He looks astonished and
  frightened._

GEOFFREY. What do you want? Have you been listening?

MAGGIE. So that's it, is it? You want to marry her when you can get rid
of me.

GEOFFREY. [_With relief._] What do you mean?

MAGGIE. Oh, I may not have heard everything, but I heard and saw enough
to catch on that you're in love with Miss Chester.

GEOFFREY. Well?

MAGGIE. Well, you won't marry her--I'll never set you free.

GEOFFREY. Sh!

  [_Looking about and closing the doors._

MAGGIE. Oh, they're all in the dining room.

GEOFFREY. [_Angry._] What do you want, anyway?

MAGGIE. [_She pleads a little._] When I came here to your house and got
a position, it was because I _loved_ you, if you _had_ treated me bad,
and I hoped by seeing you again, and being near you, you might come back
to me and everything be made straight!

GEOFFREY. Never! Never! It's impossible.

MAGGIE. [_Angry again._] Oh, is it! Well, the dirty little money you
give me now only holds my tongue quiet so long's you behave yourself and
don't run after any other girls! But the minute you try to throw me
down, I'll come out with the whole story.

GEOFFREY. I was drunk when I married you!

MAGGIE. More shame to you!

GEOFFREY. You're right. But I was only twenty--and you--led me on--

MAGGIE. [_Interrupting him._] Me! led you on! _me_, as decent and nice
a girl as there was in New Haven if I do do housework, and that's my
wedding ring and you put it there, and mother's got the certificate
locked up good and safe in her box with my dead baby sister's hair and
the silver plate off my father's coffin!

GEOFFREY. We mustn't talk here any more!

MAGGIE. You look out! If I wasn't so fond of your sister Miss Jinny,
and if the old people weren't so good to me, I'd just show you right
up _here_--_now_!

GEOFFREY. I'll _buy_ you off if I can't divorce you!

MAGGIE. _You!_ Poof!

  [_GIRLS' voices are heard from the ballroom._

GEOFFREY. Look out--some one's coming!

MAGGIE. [_Going._] You haven't got a red cent; my cheque's always one of
your _father's_!

  [_She goes out Right._

GEOFFREY. Good God! what am I going to do--shoot myself, if I don't get
out of this soon--I must get some air!

  [_He goes out Left._

  [_JINNY opens the double doors, looks in, and then enters. She is an
  adorable little human being, pretty, high-strung, temperamental, full
  of certain feminine fascination that defies analysis, which is partly
  due to the few faults she possesses. She is, of course, dressed in
  the conventional wedding-dress, a tulle veil thrown over her face._

JINNY. Not a soul! Come on!

  [_She is followed in by the four BRIDESMAIDS--nice girls every one of
  them--and also, very slyly, by SUSIE, a very modern spoiled child, who
  sits unobserved out of the way at the back._

Now, my dears, I wish to say good-by all by ourselves so I can make you
a little speech! [_All laugh gently._] In the first place I want to tell
you that there's nothing like marriage! And you must every one of you
try it! Really, I was never so happy in my life!

GRACE. Must we stand, or may we sit down?

JINNY. Oh, stand; it won't be long and you'll only crush your lovely
frocks. In fact, I advise you not to lose any time sitting down again
until you've got the happy day fixed!

RUTH. You know, Jinny darling, that there is no one so glad for your
happiness as your four bridesmaids are--isn't that so, girls?

ALL. Yes!

  [_And they all together embrace JINNY, saying, "Dear old Jinny,"
  "Darling Jinny," "We'll miss you dreadfully," etc., ad lib., till
  they get tearful._

JINNY. Good gracious, girls, we mustn't cry. I'll get red eyes, and
Jack'll think what an awful difference just the marriage service makes
in a woman.

  [_The doors at the back open, and AUSTIN appears in the doorway._

  [_AUSTIN is a typical New Yorker in appearance, thirty-two years
  old, good-looking, manly, self-poised, and somewhat phlegmatic in
  temperament._

AUSTIN. Hello! May a mere man come in to this delectable tea party?

JINNY. _No_, Jack! But _wait_--by the door till I call you!

AUSTIN. [_Amused._] Thank you!

  [_He goes out, closing the door._

GERTRUDE. We'll miss you so awfully, Jinny.

JINNY. Just what I say! Get a man to keep you company, and then you
won't miss any one.

BELLE. Yes, but attractive men with lots of money don't come into the
Grand Central Station by every train!

JINNY. [_Putting her arm about her._] You want too much, my dear Belle!
And you aren't watching the Grand Central Station either half so much
as you are the steamer docks for a suitable person. Now don't be angry;
you know you want a good big title, and you've got the money to pay,
but, my dear Belle, it's those ideas of yours that have kept you single
till--twenty-six!--now _that_ you must confess was nice of me, to take
off _three_ years!

BELLE. [_Laughing._] Jinny, you're horrid!

JINNY. No, I'm not! You know I'm _really_ fond of you, or you wouldn't
be my bridesmaid to-day; it's only that I want _your wedding_ to be as
happy as _mine_--that's all, and here's a little gift for you to
remember your disagreeable but loving friend by!

  [_Giving her a small jewelry box._

BELLE. Thank you, Jinny! Thank you!

  [_A little moved._

GRACE. Mercy! I hope you're not going to take each one of us!

JINNY. I am, and come here, _you're_ next!

GRACE. I'll swear I don't want to get married at all!

JINNY. Don't be silly, you _icicle_! Of course you don't; you freeze
all the men away, so that you've no idea how nice and comfy they can
be! My advice to you, Grace darling,--and I _love_ you, or I wouldn't
bother,--is to _thaw_! [_Laughs._] I used to be awfully jealous of you--

GRACE. [_Interrupting._] Oh!

JINNY. Yes, I was! You're lots prettier than I am.

GRACE. Jinny!

JINNY. You _are_! But I got over it because I soon saw you were so cold,
there was no danger of any conflagration near you! Oh, I've watched your
_eyes_ often to see if any man had lighted the fires in them yet. And
now I'm determined they shall be lighted. You're too _cold_! Thaw,
dear,--not to _everybody_,--that would be like slushy weather, but
don't keep yourself so continually so far below zero that you won't have
time to strike--well--say eighty-five in _the shade_, when the right bit
of masculine sunshine _does_ come along! Here--with my best love!

  [_Giving her a small jewelry box._

  [_GRACE kisses JINNY._

GERTRUDE. I am the next _victim_, I believe!

JINNY. All I've got to say to _you_, Miss, is, that if you don't decide
pretty soon on _one_ of the half dozen men you are flirting with
_disgracefully_ at present, they'll every one find you out and you'll
have to go in for widowers.

GERTRUDE. [_Mockingly._] Horrors!

JINNY. Oh, I don't know! I suppose a widower is sort of _broken in_ and
would be more likely to put up with your caprices! For the sake of your
charm and wit and true heart underneath it all, you dear old girl you!

  [_Giving her a small jewel box._

GERTRUDE. Thank you, Jinny. I'm only afraid I will do the wrong thing
with you away! You know you're always my ballast!

JINNY. Nonsense! Female ballast is no good; masculine ballast is the
only kind that's safe if you want to make life's journey in a love
balloon. [_SHE turns to RUTH CHESTER._] Ruth--the trouble with you is,
you're too sad lately, and show such a lack of interest. I should think
you might be in love, only I haven't been able to find the man. Anyway,
if you aren't in love, you must _pretend_ an interest in things. Of
course, men's affairs are awfully dull, but they don't like you to talk
about them, so it's really very easy. All you have to do is listen,
stare them straight in the eyes, think of whatever you like, and
look pleased! It _does_ flatter them, and they think _they_ are
_interesting_, and you _charming_! Wear this, and think of me! [_Giving
her a box._] and be happy! I _want_ you to be _happy_--and I can see you
aren't!

RUTH. [_Kissing her._] Thank you, dear!

JINNY. There, that's all!--except--when I come home from abroad in
October, if every one of you aren't engaged to be married, I'll wash my
hands of you--

  [_They all laugh._

  [_SUSIE, sliding off her chair at back, comes forward._

SUSIE. Now, it's my turn! You can't chuck me!

JINNY. [_Trying not to laugh._] Susie! where did you come from and _what
do_ you mean?

SUSIE. Oh, you give me a pain!--I went up the aisle with you to-day,
too--what's the matter with telling me how to get married!

JINNY. I'll tell you this, your language is dreadful; where do you get
all the boy's slang? You don't talk like a lady.

SUSIE. I'm not a lady. I'm a little girl!

JINNY. You _talk_ much more like a common boy.

SUSIE. Well, I'd rather _be_ a _boy_!

JINNY. Susie, I shall tell Aunt Laura her daughter needs looking after.

SUSIE. Oh, very well, cousin Jinny. If you're going to make trouble,
why, forget it!

  [_Turns and goes out haughtily, Right._

JINNY. [_Going to the double doors, calls._] Now you can come in, Jack.

  [_AUSTIN enters._

AUSTIN. And now I've only time to say good-by. All your guests have gone
except the Cullinghams, who are upstairs with your mother, looking at
the presents.

GERTRUDE. Come! All hands around him!

  [_The five GIRLS join hands, with AUSTIN in the centre._

BELLE. We don't care if every one else has gone or not, _we're_ here
yet!

AUSTIN. So I see! But I am ordered by my father-in-law--ahem! [_all
laugh_] --to go to my room, or he thinks there will be danger of our
losing our train.

ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS. [_Ad lib._] Where are you going? Where are you
going? We won't let you out till you tell us.

AUSTIN. I daren't--I'm afraid of my wife!

JINNY. Bravo, Jack!

GRACE. Very well, then, we'll let you out, on _one_ condition, that you
kiss us all in turn.

  [_The GIRLS laugh._

JINNY. No! No! [_Breaking away._] He shan't do any such thing!

  [_They all laugh and break up the ring._

GERTRUDE. Dear me, isn't she jealous!

BELLE. Yes, it is evidently time we all went! Good-by, Jinny! [_Kissing
her._] A happy journey to _Washington_!

JINNY. No, it isn't!

  [_General good-bys. JINNY begins with RUTH at one end, and AUSTIN at
  the other; he says good-by and shakes hands with each girl._

GERTRUDE. [_Kissing JINNY._] Good-by, and a pleasant trip to _Niagara
Falls_!

JINNY. Not a bit!

GRACE. [_Kissing JINNY._] Good-by, I believe it's _Boston_ or _Chicago_!

JINNY. _Neither!_

RUTH. Good-by, dear, and all the happiness in the world!

  [_Kisses her._

JINNY. Thank you.

  [_She turns and goes with the other three girls to the double doors at
  back, where they are heard talking._

RUTH. Mr. Austin?

AUSTIN. Yes?

  [_Joining her._

RUTH. [_Embarrassed._] You like your new brother, _don't_ you?

AUSTIN. Geof? most certainly I do, and Jinny adores him.

RUTH. I know, then, you'll be a good friend to him if he needs one.

AUSTIN. Surely I will.

RUTH. I think he does need one.

AUSTIN. Really--

  [_The GIRLS are passing out through the doors._

BELLE. Come along, Ruth.

  [_THEY pass out and JINNY stands in the doorway talking to them till
  they are out of hearing._

RUTH. Sh! please don't tell any one, not even Jinny, what I've said! I
may be betraying something I've no right to do, and don't tell _him_
I've spoken to you.

AUSTIN. All right!

  [_JINNY turns around in the doorway._

RUTH. Thank you--and good-by.

  [_Shaking his hand again._

  [_JINNY notices that they shake hands twice. A queer little look comes
  into her face._

AUSTIN. Good-by.

RUTH. Have they gone?--Oh! [_Hurrying past_ JINNY.] Good-by, dear.

  [_She goes out through the double doors._

JINNY. [_In a curious little voice._] Good-by....

[_She comes slowly down the room toward AUSTIN, and smiles at him
quizzically._] What were you two saying?

AUSTIN. Good-by!

JINNY. But you'd said it once to her already! Why did you have to say
good-by _twice_ to _Ruth_? Once was enough for all the other girls!

AUSTIN. [_Banteringly._] The first time _I_ said good-by to _her_, and
the second time _she_ said good-by to _me_!

JINNY. Do you know what I believe--_Ruth Chester's in love with you_!

AUSTIN. Oh, darling!

  [_Laughs._

JINNY. Yes, that explains the whole thing. No wonder she was _triste_
to-day.

AUSTIN. [_Laughing._] Jinny, sweetheart, don't get such an absurd notion
into your head.

JINNY. [_Looks straight at him a moment, then speaks tenderly._]
No--no--I know it's not your fault. There was no other woman in this
house for you to-day but _me_, _was_ there?

AUSTIN. There was no other woman in the world for me since the first
week I knew you.

  [_Taking her into his arms._

JINNY. This is good-by to _Jinny Tillman_!

  [_He kisses her._

Jack, darling, do you think I could sit on your knee like a little child
and put my arm around your neck and rest my head on your shoulder for
just five seconds--I'm _so tired_!

  [_MRS. CULLINGHAM opens the door._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh!

  [_Shuts the door very quickly and knocks._

  [_JINNY and AUSTIN laugh._

JINNY. Yes, yes--come in!

  [_MRS. CULLINGHAM enters. She is a handsome, whole-souled, florid
  woman; one of those creatures of inexhaustible vitality who make
  people of a nervous temperament tired almost on contact by sheer
  contrast. She is the kindest, best meaning creature in the world._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh, do excuse me! I haven't any more tact!--and I hate
to interrupt you, but I must say good-by. [_Calls._] Peter!

PETER. Yes'm.

  [_Entering with a glass of water and a powder. He sits in the
  arm-chair at right, and constantly looks at his watch._

AUSTIN. I'm much obliged to you, Mrs. Cullingham, for the interruption,
as I was sent long ago to make myself ready for the train, if you'll
excuse me!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Certainly!

JINNY. Good-by!

  [_Taking his hand as he passes her._

AUSTIN. Good-by!

  [_He goes out Right._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. If it's time for _him_, it's certainly time for _you_.
I won't keep you a minute!

JINNY. No, really we've plenty of time,-- [_both sit on sofa._] Wasn't
it a lovely wedding!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I never saw a sweeter, my dear! And it was perfectly
elegant! Simply great!

JINNY. And isn't Jack--

MRS. CULLINGHAM. He is! And so are you! In fact I've been telling your
mother I don't know how to thank you both. You've asked me to-day to
meet the swellest crowd I've ever been in where I was _invited_, and
didn't have to buy tickets, and felt I had a right to say something
besides "excuse me," and "I beg your pardon." Of course, I've sat next
to them all before in restaurants and at concerts, but this time I felt
like the real thing myself, and I shall never forget it! If you or your
husband ever want any mining tips, come to me; what my husband don't
know about mines isn't worth knowing!

JINNY. I'm as glad as I can be if you've had a good time, and you
mustn't feel indebted to us. Ever since we met in Egypt that winter,
mamma and I have always felt you were one of our best friends.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Of course you know it isn't for _my own_ sake I'm doing
these stunts to get into Society. It's all for _my boy_. He's _got_ to
have the best--or the _worst_, however you look at it! [_Laughing._]
Anyway, I want him to have a chance at it, and it belongs to him through
his father, for my first husband was a real swell!

  [_Looking at PETER lovingly._

  [_At this moment, PETER, having again looked at his watch, tips up the
  powder on his tongue, and swallows it down with the water._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Poor darling! He suffers terribly from indigestion.
That's an alkali powder he takes twenty minutes after eating. Peter, we
must say good-by now.

PETER. [_Coming up._] Good-by, Miss Jinny.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. _Mrs. Austin!_

JINNY. Oh, I'll always be "Miss Jinny" to Peter!

PETER. Thank you! We've had a great time at your wedding! _Bully food!_
But I'm _feeling_ it! [_He turns aside._] Excuse me!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I was just telling Mrs. Austin--

  [_Interrupted._

JINNY. "Jinny"--don't change.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Thank you-- [_Rises to go._] I was just saying we won't
forget in our social life, will we, Peter, that Miss Jinny gave us the
biggest boost up we've had yet?

  [_JINNY also rises._

PETER. Well, you know, mother, I don't think the game's worth the
candle. It's begun to pall on me already.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I really think he's going to be superior to it!

PETER. I only go now for your sake.

  [_MRS. TILLMAN, coming from Right, speaks off stage._

MRS. TILLMAN. Jinny! Jinny!

JINNY. Mother!

  [_MRS. TILLMAN enters._

JINNY. I ought to dress?

MRS. TILLMAN. [_To MRS. CULLINGHAM._] She'll be late if she isn't
careful.

JINNY. I'm going to. Is Maggie there?

MRS. TILLMAN. Yes, waiting!

JINNY. Good-by. [_Kisses MRS. CULLINGHAM._] Good-by. [_Shakes PETER'S
hand._]

PETER. Many happy returns!

  [_JINNY goes out Right._

MRS. TILLMAN. Come, I want to give you some of Jinny's flowers to take
home with you. Would you like some?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I should love them!

  [_They go out through the doors at back._

  [_PETER is suffering with indigestion. He takes a charcoal tablet, and
  SUSIE cautiously enters Right._

SUSIE. There you are! Have you got 'em?

PETER. No, I gave them back to you.

SUSIE. Then they're in there on the table--get 'em quick, the trunks are
coming down now!

  [_PETER goes out quickly at back, as the BUTLER and MAN SERVANT enter
  Right, carrying a large new trunk with a portmanteau on top of it._

SUSIE. Put them right over there for a minute! [_They put them down in
the centre of the room, and the FOOTMAN goes out Right._] And mind, you
don't split on us, Thomas. Auntie Tillman knows all about it--it's just
to be a nice little surprise for Cousin Jinny and my new uncle.

BUTLER. Very well, miss.

  [_He also goes out Right._

  [_At the same time PETER reenters at back with a roll of papers and
  some broad white satin ribbon. The papers are about half a foot broad
  and two feet long, and on them is printed, "We are on our honeymoon."_

PETER. [_With gay excitement._] I've got 'em.

SUSIE. Get some water--there's sticky stuff on the back!

  [_PETER gives her the papers and ribbons and goes out again at back._

SUSIE. Quick! [_Ties a big white bow on the portmanteau and on a trunk
handle._] If Auntie Tillman sees 'em, I'll bet she'll grab 'em off.
She'll be as mad as _hops_!

  [_The BUTLER and FOOTMAN reenter Right, and bring down an old steamer
  trunk and a gentleman's dressing-bag._

BUTLER. [_To the FOOTMAN._] Go and see if the carriage is there!

FOOTMAN. Yes, sir.

  [_He goes out Left._

  [_As PETER reenters from the back, with the water._

SUSIE. Quick now! Quick!

  [_They stick one label on the big steamer trunk facing the audience._

PETER. I say isn't that great!

  [_SUSIE giggles aloud with delight. The BUTLER, standing at one side,
  smiles. They put another label on the other trunk._

SUSIE. [_Giggling._] I heard them plan it,--they're taking one old trunk
purposely so as people would not catch on they were just married!

  [_Giggles delightedly._

  [_The FOOTMAN reenters with a driver, Left._

FOOTMAN. Yes, sir, it's here.

BUTLER. [_To the driver._] You can take that first.

  [_Pointing to the steamer trunk._

  [_DRIVER goes out Left with it on his shoulder, and the portmanteau._

BUTLER. Now, James, you're to go over with the luggage to Twenty-third
Street Ferry and check the heavy baggage; you know where to.

FOOTMAN. Yes, sir.

SUSIE. [_Eagerly._] Oh, _where to?_

BUTLER. I am hunder hoath not to tell, Miss.

SUSIE. O pish!

  [_Kneeling in the big arm-chair and watching proceedings from behind
  its back._

BUTLER. [_Continues to the FOOTMAN._] And wait with the checks and Mr.
Austin's dressing-bag-- [_Showing it._] --until they come.

FOOTMAN. Yes, sir.

PETER. And make haste, or, I say, somebody'll turn up and give our whole
joke away!

  [_The DRIVER reenters._

SUSIE. Yes, _do_ hurry!

FOOTMAN. [_To the DRIVER._] Come along.

  [_They take the big trunk out Left. BUTLER follows with the
  dressing-bag._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Calls from the room at back._] Peter darling, are you
there?

SUSIE. Phew! Just in time!

  [_Sliding down into a more correct position in the chair._

PETER. Yes, mother!

  [_Going to back._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_In the doorway, at back._] Come, take these beautiful
roses from Mrs. Tillman!

  [_MRS. CULLINGHAM and MRS. TILLMAN enter._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_With her arms full of roses._] Thomas will take them
down.

PETER. No, I'd like to. Aren't they bully?

  [_He takes them._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_To MRS. TILLMAN._] Good-by, and thank you again. I
know you must want to go up to Jinny.

MRS. TILLMAN. Yes, she may need me to help her a little. Good-by.
Good-by, Peter.

PETER. Good-by, ma'm.

  [_MRS. TILLMAN goes out Right._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Why, Susie, how do you do?

SUSIE. [_Glides out of the chair and stands before it._] How do you do?

  [_Embarrassed._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. You're a good little girl, I hope?

SUSIE. I don't! I hate good little girls!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. O my!

  [_She goes out, laughing, Left._

  [_PETER, coming to SUSIE, catches her in his arms and kisses her, much
  against her will._

SUSIE. [_Furious._] Oh, you horrid, nasty thing, you! [_She strikes at
him; he runs; she chases him from one side of the room to the other,
around a sofa and table, and out Left, screaming as she chases him._] I
hate you! I hate you!

  [_MAGGIE enters Right._

MAGGIE. Miss Susie, Mrs. Tillman wants to see you upstairs.

SUSIE. What for?

MAGGIE. I don't know, Miss.

SUSIE. Pshaw! have I got to go? All right!

  [_Going toward the door at Right._

  [_AUSTIN enters, meeting SUSIE._

AUSTIN. Hello! Where are _you_ going?

SUSIE. Oh, up to Auntie Tillman's room. Goodness knows what for; it's an
awful bore! Want to come along?

AUSTIN. No, thank you; but if you see your Cousin Jinny, you might tell
her I am down.

SUSIE. [_Hanging on to him._] I say! Where are you and Cousin Jinny
going to, anyway?

AUSTIN. [_Smiling._] I don't know.

SUSIE. O my, what a fib! And that's a nice example to set a little girl!

  [_She goes out Right._

MAGGIE. [_Coming forward._] I beg pardon, sir, but may I speak to you a
minute?

AUSTIN. Certainly, Maggie, what is it?

MAGGIE. I've been trying for a chance to see you alone. I wouldn't
bother you, sir--but it's only because I'm fond of Miss Jinny, and of
Mr. and Mrs. Tillman, and they've all been so good to me; I know it
would nearly kill 'em if they knew.

AUSTIN. Come, Maggie, knew what?

MAGGIE. Well, _one member_ of this family ain't been good to me, sir.
[_From this point her feelings begin to get the better of her and she
speaks rapidly and hysterically._] He's been bad, bad as he could, and
somebody's got to talk to him, and I don't see who's a-goin' to do it
but you. If he don't change, I'll not hold my tongue any longer. It's
all I can do for their sakes to hold it now!

AUSTIN. Look here, what are you talking about? You don't mean Mr.
Geoffrey?

MAGGIE. Yes, I do, sir; he's my husband.

AUSTIN. What!!

MAGGIE. We was married when he was at Yale, sir; I was in a shop there.

AUSTIN. But--! Well, after all, isn't this your and Geoffrey's affair?
Why bring me in?

MAGGIE. Because he's making love to Miss Chester, and promising to marry
_her_ now, and if he don't stop--I'll make trouble!

AUSTIN. But if he's married to you, as you say--he can't marry--any one
else.

MAGGIE. He's tried to make me believe our marriage ain't legal, because
he was only twenty and he'd been drinking!

AUSTIN. What makes you think Mr. Geoffrey cares for--Miss Chester?

MAGGIE. I just heard and see him making love to her _here_!

AUSTIN. This is a pretty bad story, Maggie.

MAGGIE. Yes, sir, and the worst is, sir, I know I ain't good enough for
him, and that's why I've kept still about it these three years, but I
can't help loving him no matter how ugly he's treated me. [_Breaking
down into tears._] I just can't help it! I _love_ him, sir, even if I'm
only a servant girl, and I can't stand it thinking he's going to try and
get rid of me for some one else!

  [_She sobs out loud._

AUSTIN. Sh!--Maggie. Sit down a minute, and control yourself.
Somebody'll hear you, and besides they'll be coming down presently. I'll
have a talk with Mr. Geoffrey when I come back--

  [_Interrupted as GEOFFREY enters Left. He doesn't see MAGGIE, who is
  collapsed in a corner of the sofa._

GEOFFREY. [_To AUSTIN._] Ah! Thank goodness I've caught you; I had an
awful headache and went out for a breath of air, and then I was afraid I
might have missed you! I knew in that case Jinny would never forgive me,
nor--I--myself--for that--matter--

  [_His voice grows less exuberant in the middle of his speech and
  finally at the end almost dies away, as he sees the expression in
  AUSTIN'S face and realizes that something is wrong somewhere. When
  he stops speaking, MAGGIE gives a gasping sob. He hears it, and
  starting, sees her._

GEOFFREY. Maggie!

AUSTIN. Geoffrey, is what this girl says true?

GEOFFREY. That I married her in New Haven? Yes.

MAGGIE. [_Rises._] I'll go, please, I'd rather go.

AUSTIN. Yes, go, Maggie; it's better.

  [_MAGGIE goes out Right._

GEOFFREY. [_As soon as she is out of the room._] Promise me, Jack, you
won't tell any one! It's awful, I know! For two years at college I went
all to pieces and led a rotten life,--and one night, drunk, I married
her, and it isn't so much her fault. I suppose she thought I loved
her,--but this would break up the old lady and gentleman so, if they
knew, I couldn't stand it! And Jinny, for God's sake, don't tell Jinny.
_She respects me._ You won't tell her, will you?

AUSTIN. No. But Maggie says you want to marry some one else now.

GEOFFREY. [_With a change, in great shame._] That's true, too.

  [_He sits in utter dejection on the sofa._

AUSTIN. How are you going to do it?

GEOFFREY. I must make money somehow and buy off Maggie.

AUSTIN. Yes, go out to Sioux Falls, get a divorce there on respectable
grounds, and settle a sum of money on Maggie.

GEOFFREY. But I can't do that!

AUSTIN. Why not?

GEOFFREY. I can't do anything that would give publicity, and that
divorce would.

AUSTIN. Any divorce would; you can't get rid of that.

GEOFFREY. I tell you I can't have publicity. Ruth--Miss Chester--would
hear of it.

AUSTIN. Well, if she loves you, she'll forgive your wild oats,
especially as every one sees now what a steady, straight fellow you've
become.

GEOFFREY. It's Ruth! But I can't do that. No, Jack, you must help--you
will, won't you? Oh, _do_, for Jinny's sake! Help me to persuade Maggie
to keep silent for good, tear up that certificate of marriage. I was
only twenty; it's hardly legal, and I'll settle a good sum--

  [_Interrupted._

AUSTIN. [_Going straight to him, puts his hand heavily on his
shoulder._] Good God, you're proposing bigamy! You've done enough; don't
stoop to _crime_!

  [_The two MEN face each other a moment. GEOFFREY'S head drops._

AUSTIN. Forget you ever said that; do what I tell you when Jinny and I
have gone abroad, so she will be away from it a little, and if you want
money, let me know.

  [_JINNY enters Right, with nervous gaiety, covering an upheaving
  emotion which is very near the surface._

JINNY. Ready! And there _you_ are, Geof. I've been sending all over the
house after you! Good-by! [_Throwing her arms about him._] Dear old
Geof! Haven't we had good times together! Always, always from the
youngest days I can remember--I don't believe there were ever a brother
and sister so sympathetic; I know there was never a brother such a
perfect darling as you were--I'll miss you, Geof! [_The tears come into
her voice, anyway._] I used to think I'd never marry at all if I
couldn't marry _you_, and I _do_ think _he_ is the only man in the world
who could have taken me away from home, so long as you were there! [_To
AUSTIN, smiling._] You aren't jealous?

AUSTIN. No!

JINNY. [_In jest._] Isn't it awful! You can't _make_ him jealous! I
think it's a positive flaw in his character! Not like--_us_, is he?

GEOFFREY. Dear old girl--

JINNY. [_Whispers to him._] And I've noticed how you've overcome certain
things, dear Geof. I know it's been _hard_, and I'm proud of you.

GEOFFREY. Sh! Jinny, dear old sister! I'll miss _you_! By George, Jin,
the house'll be awful without--but you-- [_His voice grows husky._]
--just excuse me a minute!

  [_He is about to break down, and so hurries out Right._

JINNY. [_Sniffling._] He was going to cry! Oh, Jack, you'll be a brother
to Geoffrey, won't you? You know he's been awfully dissipated, and he's
changed it all, all by himself! _If he should go wrong again_--I believe
it would break my heart, I love him so!

AUSTIN. I'll do _more_ for him, if he ever needs me, than if he were _my
own_ brother, because he's _yours_!

JINNY. [_Presses his hand and looks up at him lovingly and gratefully._]
Thank you. Wait here just a minute; I know he won't come back to say
good-by. He's gone up to his room, I'm sure--I'll just surprise him with
a hug and my hands over his eyes like we used to do years ago.

  [_She starts to go out Right, and meets MR. and MRS. TILLMAN, who
  enter._

TILLMAN. The carriage is here!

JINNY. I won't be a second--

  [_She goes out Right._

MRS. TILLMAN. Where has she gone?

AUSTIN. Up to her brother.

MRS. TILLMAN. Her father's been locked up in his study for three
hours--he _says_ thinking, but to _me_ his eyes look very suspicious!

  [_Taking her husband's arm affectionately._

TILLMAN. [_Clears his throat._] Nonsense!

MRS. TILLMAN. Well, _how many cigars did you smoke_?

TILLMAN. Eight.

MRS. TILLMAN. The amount of emotion that a man can soak out of himself
with tobacco is wonderful! He uses it just like a sponge!

TILLMAN. Jack, the first thing I asked about you when I heard
that--er--that things were getting this way was, does he smoke? A man
who smokes has always that outlet. If things go wrong--go out and smoke
a cigar, and when the cigar's _finished_, ten to one everything's got
right, somehow! If you lose your temper, don't speak!--a cigar, and when
it's finished, then speak! You'll find the temper all gone up in the
smoke! A woman's happiness is safest with a man who smokes. [_He clears
his throat, which is filling._] God bless you, Jack, it _is_ a wrench;
our only girl, you know. She's been a great joy--ahem!

  [_He quickly gets out a cigar._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Stopping him from smoking._] No, no, dear, they're
_going now_!

TILLMAN. Well, the best I can say is, I wish you as happy a married life
as her mother and I have had.

MRS. TILLMAN. Thirty-five _dear_ years! But now, George, let me say a
word--you always have monopolized our new son--he'll be much fonder of
you than _me_!

TILLMAN. Old lady!--Jealous!--

MRS. TILLMAN. Turn about is fair play--you're jealous still of Jinny and
me. [_She pauses a moment._] I think we'd better tell him!

TILLMAN. All right. The only rifts in our lute, Jack, have been little
threads of jealousy that have snapped sometimes!

MRS. TILLMAN. Nothing ever serious--of course, _but_ it's a fault that
Jinny shares with us, and the _only fault_ we've ever been able to find.

TILLMAN. We called her for years the girl with the green eyes. She goes
it pretty _strong_ sometimes!

AUSTIN. Oh, that's all right--I shall _like_ it!

MRS. TILLMAN. You'll always bear with her, won't you, if she should ever
get jealous of you?

AUSTIN. Of _me_? I'll never give _her the chance_.

MRS. TILLMAN. It isn't a question of chance; you just can't help it
sometimes, can you, George?

TILLMAN. No, you can't.

MRS. TILLMAN. And so--

AUSTIN. Don't worry! Your daughter's safe with me. I'm not the jealous
sort myself and I love Jinny so completely, so calmly, and yet with my
heart, and soul, and mind, and body, she'll never have a _chance_ even
to _try_ to be jealous of _me_!

TILLMAN. Sh!

  [_JINNY enters Right._

JINNY. I found poor Maggie up in my room crying! She says she can't bear
to have me go away. I think she's sorry now she wouldn't come with me as
maid--and I said good-by to cook and she sniffed!

  [_AUSTIN looks at his watch._

AUSTIN. Oh! we ought to go!

MRS. TILLMAN. Good-by, darling!

  [_Kissing JINNY and embracing her a long time, while AUSTIN and
  TILLMAN shake hands warmly and say good-by._

JINNY. [_Going to her father._] Good-by, father. Dear old father!

  [_With happy emotion._

  [_AUSTIN meanwhile is shaking hands with MRS. TILLMAN._

JINNY. [_Returns to her mother._] Darling--oh, how good you've always
been to me! Oh, mummy darling, I _shall_ miss you! You'll send me a
letter to-morrow, won't you, or a telegram? Send a telegram--you've got
the address!

MRS. TILLMAN. [_With tears in her eyes._] Yes, it's written down!

JINNY. You can tell father, but no one else!

  [_Hugs and kisses her mother._

TILLMAN. Come, Susan! They'll lose their train!

  [_JINNY again embraces her father._

ALL. Good-by! Good-by!

  [_JINNY, starting to go with AUSTIN, suddenly leaves him and runs back
  again to her mother and throws herself in her arms. They embrace, in
  tears._

JINNY. Good-by, mother!

MRS. TILLMAN. Good-by, my darling!

TILLMAN. Come, come! they'll lose their train!

  [_JINNY runs to AUSTIN, and with his arms about her, they hurry to
  the door Left. They go through the doors at back to window in the
  corridor. JINNY stops at the door and she and AUSTIN face each other
  a moment._

JINNY. [_Looking up at him._] Oh, Jack!

  [_She throws her arms about his neck and buries her face on his
  shoulder._

AUSTIN. Jinny, Jinny dear, you're not sorry?

JINNY. [_Slowly raises her head and looks at him, smiling through her
tears, and speaks in a voice full of tears and little sobs._] Sorry? Oh,
no! Oh, no! It hurts me to leave them, but I never was so _happy_ in my
life!

  [_He kisses her and they hurry out, with his arm about her._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_In the corridor, lifts the window._] I hear the door--

TILLMAN. There they are!

  [_SUSIE rushes across the stage with a bowl of rice in her arms and
  goes out Left._

  [_MR. and MRS. TILLMAN wave and say "Good-by!" "Good-by!" "Good-by!"
  They close the window in silence. The sound is heard as the window
  frame reaches the bottom. They turn and come slowly forward, TILLMAN
  wiping his eyes and MRS. TILLMAN biting her lips to keep the tears
  back. They come into the front room and stop, and for a second they
  look around the empty room. TILLMAN puts his hand in his pocket and
  takes out his cigar case. MRS. TILLMAN, turning, sees him; she goes
  to him swiftly and touches his arm, looking up at him through her
  tears. He turns to her and slowly takes her in his arms and holds
  her there close and kisses her tenderly on the cheek._

  [_SUSIE enters Left, with empty bowl, sobbing aloud, as_

    THE CURTAIN FALLS




ACT II

(_Two months later_)


_The Vatican, Rome; the Tribune of the Apollo Belvedere; a semicircular
  room with dark red walls; in the centre is the large statue of Apollo.
  There are doorways at Right and Left. There is a bench on the right
  side of the room. A single LADY TOURIST enters Right, takes a hasty
  glance, yawns, and looking down at her Baedeker, goes out Left. A
  PAPAL GUARD is seen passing outside in the court. A FRENCHMAN and his
  WIFE (with Baedekers) are seen approaching; they are heard talking
  volubly. They enter Left._

BOTH. Ah!--

  [_They stand a moment in silent admiration._

HE. [_Reading from Baedeker._] Apollo Belvedere. [_He looks up._] C'est
superb!

SHE. [_Beaming with admiration._] Magnifique! Voila un homme!

HE. _Quelle grace!_

SHE. _Quelle force!_

  [_Both talk at once in great admiration and intense excitement for
  a few moments. Then he suddenly drops into his ordinary tone and
  manner._

HE. Allons, allons nous!

SHE. [_In the same tone._] Oui, j'ai faim!

  [_They go out Right._

  [_JINNY and AUSTIN enter Left, he looking over his shoulder. They
  stand a moment just inside the doorway._

JINNY. What are you looking back so much for, Jackie?

AUSTIN. I thought I saw some one I know.

JINNY. Who?

AUSTIN. I didn't know who; it just seemed to be a familiar back.

JINNY. [_Playfully._] Oh, come! I think the present works of art and
your loving wife are quite enough for you to look at without hunting
around for familiar backs!

AUSTIN. And Baedeker! [_Reading from Baedeker about the Apollo._] Apollo
Belvedere, found at the end of the fifteenth century, probably in a
Roman villa--

JINNY. Of course, Apollo!

AUSTIN. Great, isn't it?

JINNY. Stunning! [_She turns and looks at him, smiling quizzically._]
_Still_--but I suppose I'm prejudiced!

AUSTIN. [_Obtuse._] Still what?

JINNY. You dear old stupid! You know, Jack, you're deeply and
_fundamentally_ clever and brilliant, but you're not quite-- _bright_--
_not quick_!

  [_Laughing._

AUSTIN. Don't you think having _one_ in the family quick as chain
lightning is enough? What have I missed this time, Jinny? You don't mean
you've found a family likeness in the statue over there? I don't want to
be unappreciative, but it doesn't suggest your father to me in the
least,--nor even Geoffrey.

JINNY. _Stupid!!_ Of course it doesn't _suggest_ anybody to me--I was
only thinking I sympathized with Mrs. Perkins of Boston,--don't you know
the old story about her?

AUSTIN. No, what was it?

JINNY. [_After a quick look around to see that they are alone._]
Well--Mrs. Perkins from Boston was personally conducted here once and
shown this very statue, and she looked at it for a few moments, and then
turned around and said, "Yes, it's all right, but give _me Perkins_!"

AUSTIN. Jinny!

  [_Laughing._

JINNY. Are you shocked? Come, I'm tired; let's sit down here and read my
letters--there's one from Geof.

  [_They sit on the bench at Right, and JINNY takes out a letter from
  GEOFFREY._

AUSTIN. I'll read ahead in Baedeker and you tell me if there's any news.
[_He opens the Baedeker and reads, and she opens and reads the letter._]
Where is Geof's letter from?

JINNY. New York, of course; where else would it be?

AUSTIN. I had an idea he was going away.

JINNY. Geof! Where?

AUSTIN. West, a good way somewhere.

JINNY. But _why_ would he go West?

AUSTIN. Oh, he had some business, I believe; I remember thinking it was
a good idea when he told me. It was the day we were married--I was
waiting for you to come downstairs.

JINNY. I think it's very funny Geof never said anything about it to
_me_.

AUSTIN. My dear, what time had _you_? You were _getting married_!!

JINNY. I _was_! Thank heaven! I'm _so happy_, Jack!

  [_Snuggling up to him on the bench._

AUSTIN. [_Steals a little, quick hug with his arm about her waist._]
Bless you, darling, I don't think there was ever a man as happy as I am!

  [_They start apart quickly as a GERMAN COUPLE enter Right, with a
  YOUNG DAUGHTER, who is munching a cake, and hanging, a tired and
  unwilling victim, to her mother's hand._

WOMAN. Ach! schoen! sehr schoen!!

MAN. Groesses, nicht?

WOMAN. _Yah!_

  [_They stand admiring._

AUSTIN. By the way, when you answer your brother's letter, I wish you'd
say I seemed surprised he was still in New York.

JINNY. [_Reading._] Um--um--

MAN. [_Wiping his warm brow._] _Wunderbaum!_

WOMAN. _Yah!!_

  [_They go out Left, talking._

JINNY. [_Looking up from her letter._] Oh! what do you think?

AUSTIN. That you're the sweetest woman in the world.

JINNY. No, _darling_, I mean _who_ do you think Geoffrey says is over
here and in Italy?

AUSTIN. I haven't the most remote idea! So far as _I've_ been able to
observe there has been absolutely _no one_ in Italy but _you and me_.

JINNY. If you keep on talking like that, I shall kiss you!

AUSTIN. What! before the tall, white gentleman? [_Motioning to Apollo._]
I am dumb.

JINNY. [_Very lovingly._] Silly! Well!--Mrs. Cullingham and Peter are
over here and have brought Ruth Chester!

AUSTIN. [_Speaking without thinking._] Then it _was_ her back.

JINNY. [_With the smallest sharpening of the look in her eye._] When?

AUSTIN. That I saw just now.

JINNY. [_With the tiniest suggestion of a strain in her voice._] You
said you didn't know whom it reminded you of.

AUSTIN. Yes, I know, I didn't quite.

JINNY. But if you thought it was Ruth Chester, why not have said so?

AUSTIN. No reason, dear, I simply didn't think.

JINNY. Well-- [_Sententiously._] --_next time--think!_

AUSTIN. What else does Geoffrey say?

JINNY. Oh, nothing. The heat for two days was frightful--already they
miss me more than he can say--

  [_Interrupted._

AUSTIN. I'll bet.

JINNY. Father smoked nineteen cigars a day the first week I was gone.

AUSTIN. _I_ haven't _had_ to smoke _any_!

JINNY. Mercy! don't boast!--and he thinks they will all soon go to Long
Island for the summer.

AUSTIN. Doesn't he say a word nor a hint at his going West?

JINNY. No, he says he may go to Newport for August, and that's all.

  [_Putting away letter, and getting out others._

AUSTIN. Going to read all those?

JINNY. If you don't mind, while I rest. _Do_ you mind?

AUSTIN. Of course not, but I think while you're reading I'll just take a
little turn and see if I can't come across the Cullinghams.

  [_Rising._

JINNY. [_After the merest second's pause, and looking seriously at
him._] Why don't you?

AUSTIN. I'll bring them here if I find them--

  [_He goes out Right._

  [_JINNY looks up where he went off and gazes, motionless, for a few
  moments. Then she throws off the mood and opens a letter._

  [_Two tired Americans enter Right, a girl and her mother, MRS. LOPP
  and CARRIE._

MRS. LOPP. What's this, Carrie?

CARRIE. [_Looking in her Baedeker._] I don't know; I've sort of lost my
place, somehow!

MRS. LOPP. Well, we must be in Room No. 3 or 4--ain't we?

CARRIE. [_Reads out._] The big statue at the end of Room No. 3 is Diana
the Huntress.

MRS. LOPP. This must be it, then,--Diana! Strong-looking woman, ain't
she?

CARRIE. Yes, very nice. You know she was the goddess who wouldn't let
the men see her bathe.

MRS. LOPP. Mercy, Carrie! and did all the other goddesses? I don't think
much of their habits. I suppose this is the same person those Italians
sell on the streets at home, and call the Bather.

  [_JINNY is secretly very much amused, finally she speaks._

JINNY. Excuse me, but you are in one of the cabinets--and this is the
Apollo Belvedere.

MRS. LOPP. Oh, thank you very much. I guess we've got mixed up with the
rooms,--seems as if there's so many.

CARRIE. [_Triumphantly._] There! I _thought_ it was a man all the time!

MRS. LOPP. Well, what with so many of the statues only being piecemeal,
as it were, and so many of the men having kinder women's hair, I declare
it seems as if I don't know the ladies from the gentlemen half the time.

CARRIE. Did the rest of us go through here?

JINNY. I beg your pardon?

CARRIE. Thirty-four people with a gassy guide? We got so tired hearing
him talk that we jes' sneaked off by ourselves, and now we're a little
scared about getting home; we belong to the Cook's Gentlemen and Ladies.

JINNY. Oh, no, the others haven't passed through here; probably they
have gone to see the pictures; you'd better go back and keep asking the
attendants the way to the pictures till you get there.

MRS. LOPP. [_With rather subdued voice._] Thank you! We've come to do
Europe and the Holy Land in five weeks for $400--but I don't know, seems
as if I'm getting awful tired--after jes' sevin days.

CARRIE. [_Affectionately._] Now, mommer, don't give up; it's because you
haven't got over being seasick yet; that's all!

JINNY. [_Helplessly._] Oh, yes, you'll find it much less tiring in a few
days, I'm sure.

MRS. LOPP. Still Rome does seem a powerful way from _home_! How'll we
ask for the pictures?

CARRIE. Why, mommer! "Tableaux!" "Tableaux!" I should think you'd 'a'
learned that from our church entertainments! Good-by; thank you ever so
much.

MRS. LOPP. You haven't lost _your party_, too, have you?

JINNY. [_Smiling._] I hope not! He _promised_ to come back!!

MRS. LOPP. Oh! pleased to have met you--Good-by!

  [_They start off Left._

JINNY. No, not that way--back the way you came.

MRS. LOPP. Oh, thank you!

  [_She drops her black silk bag; out of it drop crackers, an account
  book, a thimble, a thread-and-needle case, a bottle of pepsin tablets,
  etc. They all stoop to pick the collection up, JINNY helping._

JINNY. [_Handing._] I'm sure you'll want these!

MRS. LOPP. Yes, indeed; don't you find them coupon meals very
dissatisfactory?

CARRIE. Thank you ever so much again. Come on, mommer!

  [_MRS. LOPP and CARRIE go out Left._

  [_JINNY looks at her watch and goes back to her letter._

  [_MRS. CULLINGHAM enters Left._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Screams._] Jinny!

JINNY. [_Jumps up._] Mrs. Cullingham! [_They embrace._] Did Jack find
you?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. No, we haven't seen him! Ruth and Peter are dawdling
along, each on their own; I like to shoot through a gallery. There's no
use spending so much time; when it's over you've mixed everything all up
just the same!

JINNY. [_Laughing._] Well, I've this minute read a letter from Geoffrey
saying you were over here. And Jack, who thought he got a glimpse of you
a little while ago, went straight off to try and find you.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. What fun it is to see you--and how _happy_ you look!

JINNY. I couldn't _look_ as happy as I _feel_!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Glancing at the statue._] Who's your friend? Nice
gent, isn't he?

  [_Laughing._

JINNY. Mr. Apollo! Would you like to meet him?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Hesitates._] Er--no--I don't think! You must draw the
line somewhere! He wouldn't do a thing to Corbett, would he?

JINNY. Who was Corbett?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. He was a prize fighter, and _is_--but that's another
story-- Do you mean to say you've never heard of him?

JINNY. Oh, the name sounds familiar. But this, you know, is Apollo.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. No, I don't know; was he a champion?

JINNY. No, he was a Greek god!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh, was he? Well, I wouldn't have cared about being in
the tailoring business in those days, would you? Let's sit down. [_They
sit on bench Right._] Of course you know we wouldn't accept a thing like
that in Peoria, where I come from, as a gift! No, indeed! If the King of
Italy sent it over to our Mayor, he'd return it C.O.D.

JINNY. Sounds like Boston and the Macmonnies Bacchante!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh, my dear, _worse_ than that! It reminds me of a man
at home who kept an underclothing store in our principal street and had
a plaster cast of this gent's brother, I should think, in his window to
show a suit of Jaegers on,--you know, a "combination"! And our Town
Committee of Thirteen for the moral improvement of Peoria made the man
take it out of his window and hang the suit up empty!

JINNY. Poor man!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. You ought to see our Park!--you know we've got a
perfectly beautiful park,--and all the _men_ statues wear Prince
Alberts, and stand like this-- [_She poses with lifted arm at right
angle to body._] --as if they were saying, "This way out" or "To the
monkey cage and zoo."

JINNY. [_Laughing._] But the women statues?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. My dear! They only have heads and hands; all the rest's
just clumps of drapery--we only have "Americans" and "Libertys," anyway.
They apply the Chinese emigration law to all Venuses and _sich ladies_!

  [_They both laugh._

JINNY. Where did you say Peter and Ruth were?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Well, I left Peter--who isn't at all well; I hoped this
trip would help his indigestion, but it seems to have made it worse!--I
left him--er--in a room with a lot of _broken-up Venuses_--I thought it
was all right; he was eating candy, and there wasn't a whole woman among
'em!

JINNY. [_Slight strain in her voice._] How did you happen to bring over
Ruth Chester?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Well, you know I always liked her. She never snubbed me
in her life--I don't think any one you've introduced me to has been
quite so nice to Peter and me as Mrs. Chester and her daughter.

JINNY. O they _are_ real people!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Ruth is terribly depressed over something. She's thin
as a rail and the family are worried. She says there's nothing worrying
her, and the doctors can't find anything the matter with her,--so Mrs.
Chester asked me if I wouldn't take her abroad. They thought the voyage
and change might do her good, and I seem to have a more cheery influence
over her than most people. So here we are! [_As PETER enters Left,
eating._] Here's Peter! How do you think the darling looks?

PETER. How do you do, Mrs. Austin?

JINNY. How do you do, Peter? [_They shake hands._] I'm sorry to hear you
are seedy, but you eat too many sweet things.

PETER. I'm not eating candy; it's soda mints! [_Showing a small
bottle._] I _am_ bad to-day, mother.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. If you don't get better, we'll go to Carlsbad.

JINNY. How do you like Rome, Peter?

PETER. Oh, I don't know--too much Boston and not enough Chicago to make
it a real lively town.

JINNY. [_Laughing._] I think I'll go look for Jack and tell him you've
turned up.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Perhaps he's found Ruth.

JINNY. [_With a change in her voice._] Yes, perhaps.

  [_She goes out Right._

PETER. [_Going to the doorway Right, calls after her._] Ruth's in a room
on your left, with rows of men's heads on shelves, Emperors and
things,--but gee, such a _job lot_!

  [_Comes back and looks up at the statue._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Isn't it beautiful, Peter?

PETER. No, it's _too big_!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Still this one isn't broken!

PETER. That's a comfort! Yes, it has been mended, too! [_Examining._]
Oh, yes, it's only another of these second-hand statues. Say, you missed
one whole one, the best I've seen yet! A Venus off in a fine little
room, all mosaics and painted walls,--that's where I've been.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Why, Peter Cullingham! _Alone?_ What kind of a Venus?

PETER. Oh, beautiful! I forgot to take my medicine!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Was she--er--_dressed_, darling?

PETER. We--you know--she _had_ been, but she'd sort of pushed it a good
way off!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_With a sigh._] You know we _ought_ to admire these
things, Peter darling; that's partly what we've come to Europe for!

PETER. O pshaw! here comes a gang of tourists. Come on, let's skip!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. But Ruth and Mrs. Austin?

PETER. We didn't agree to wait, and we can all meet at our hotel.

  [_A crowd of TOURISTS, led by a GUIDE, presses and crowds in the
  doorway. They drag their tired feet in a listless shuffle across the
  room and stand in a somewhat sheepish and stupid bunch at the statue.
  One or two of the younger women nudge each other and giggle. The GUIDE
  stands a little in advance of them. The GUIDE describes the statue,
  and while he is doing so PETER and MRS. CULLINGHAM go out Right. Most
  of the TOURISTS turn and watch them go instead of looking at the
  statue._

GUIDE. This is the Apollo Belvedere, discovered at the end of the
fifteenth century, some say in a Roman villa or farm-house near the
Grotter Terratter. Very fine specimen both as marble and man. This
statyer is calculated to make Sandow et cetery look like thirty cents.
Height seven feet, weight--

A MAN TOURIST. How much?

A GIRL TOURIST. Was he married?

  [_Titters from the group._

GUIDE. Give it up! Should judge he was. The god once held a bow in his
left hand and probably a laurel wreath in his right.

ANOTHER WOMAN TOURIST. A what?

GUIDE. A laurel wreath. You want to take a good look at this, as it is a
very fine piece. Now come along, please--make haste; we must finish up
this place before feeding!

  [_He leads the way out Right, and the TOURISTS follow, shuffling
  along, without speaking, MRS. LOPP and CARRIE lagging in the rear._

  [_AUSTIN enters Left, followed by RUTH._

AUSTIN. This is where I left her with Apollo! [_Calls._] Jinny! She
seems to have gone!

  [_He looks behind the statue and out door, Right._

RUTH. Probably the Cullinghams, who were headed in this direction, found
her, and they've all gone back for us; you see I walked all around the
court first without going into the rooms, so I missed them, but found
you.

AUSTIN. What shall we do? Sit down here and wait for them to come back,
or shall I go in search?

RUTH. Oh, no, you might miss them, and then we'd all be lost! If you
left Jinny here, she's sure to come back to meet you.

  [_She sits on the bench and AUSTIN stands behind her._

AUSTIN. I'm sorry to learn you've been ill.

RUTH. Oh! it's nothing.

AUSTIN. Ah, I'm afraid it's a good deal. Will you forgive me if I say I
think I know what it is!

  [_She looks up startled._

  [_After a moment._

You haven't forgotten the day of Jinny's and my wedding, when you told
me Geoffrey Tillman needed a friend?

RUTH. I hoped _you'd_ forgotten; I oughtn't to have told you; I
_oughtn't_ to have!

AUSTIN. Why not? I had a talk with Geoffrey, then, and he told me
everything.

RUTH. He did! You are sure?

AUSTIN. Sure.

  [_He sits beside her._

RUTH. That he and I--

AUSTIN. Love each other.

RUTH. Oh, but that isn't all.

AUSTIN. I know the rest!

RUTH. He told you--about--about--

AUSTIN. The marriage?--Yes?

RUTH. Oh, I'm so glad, so glad! Now I can speak of it to some one, and
some one who can advise me, and will help us.

AUSTIN. I have already advised him, but he doesn't seem to be taking my
advice; it has worried me.

RUTH. When I left he was awfully depressed. He said he saw no prospect
of being able to publish our marriage for years, maybe!

AUSTIN. _What_ marriage?

  [_In astonishment._

RUTH. _Our_ marriage, in Brooklyn! [_She notices his expression and is
alarmed._] You said he had told you!

AUSTIN. [_Recovering himself, and speaking at first with hesitation._]
Yes, but not the details, not--wait, I'm a little confused. [_Rising and
walking a moment._] Let's get it all quite clear now, that's the only
way I can help you--both; I ought, of course, to have gone through it
all with him, but there really wasn't time.

RUTH. I can't go on like this much longer. It's killing me to deceive
mother; I _must_ tell her soon!

AUSTIN. [_Quickly, stops walking._] No. You mustn't, not yet, if I'm
going to help you; you'll obey me, won't you?

RUTH. Yes, if you only will help us!

AUSTIN. You said you and Geoffrey Tillman were married where?

RUTH. In Brooklyn.

AUSTIN. When?

RUTH. A month before your wedding.

AUSTIN. [_To himself._] It's impossible!

  [_Walking up and down._

RUTH. [_Smiling sadly._] Oh, no! I remember the date only too well.

AUSTIN. I didn't mean that.

RUTH. I lied to my mother that day for the first time--at any rate,
since I was a child--and I've been lying to her ever since.

AUSTIN. [_Probing her._] But--but why were you married so secretly?

RUTH. We couldn't afford to marry and set up for ourselves. He expected
then to be sent off at once to the Philippines, and--well he didn't want
to leave me behind, free; I'm afraid he's rather jealous--you must have
found out by now that Jinny is. They all are! And _I_ didn't want him to
go so far off without my belonging to him either; _I'm_ that jealous,
too! [_Smiling._] So--that's why!

AUSTIN. And this long period of secrecy since then--do you understand
that?

Ruth. Hasn't he explained to you his debts? You know before he loved me
he was very fast, but since--

AUSTIN. Yes, I know how he gave up every one of his old habits with a
great deal of courage.

RUTH. _Nobody_ knows what it cost him! How can you help us? Get him
something to do to pay off his debts? Or can't you make him feel even if
we do have to go on living at our different homes for a while, it is
better to publish the fact that we are married?--

AUSTIN. I shall go back at once to America if I can persuade Jinny!

RUTH. And I, too?

AUSTIN. No. You must stay abroad till I send word for you to come home.
If I am going to help you, you will help me by doing exactly as I say,
won't you?

RUTH. Yes.

AUSTIN. It's _very_ important that you should _absolutely obey me_!

RUTH. _I will._

  [_A pause._

  [_JINNY, unnoticed by either of them, appears in the doorway at Right.
  AUSTIN is walking up and down. RUTH is leaning her elbow on the back
  of the bench and burying her face in her hands._

AUSTIN. It's awful! My God, it's awful!

JINNY. [_In a strained, assumed, nonchalant tone._] _What is?_

RUTH. Jinny!

  [_Rising._

AUSTIN. I didn't hear you, Jinny!

JINNY. No, you both seemed so absorbed.

RUTH. [_Going to JINNY._] I'm so glad to see you.

  [_Kisses her, but JINNY only gives her her cheek and that rather
  unwillingly; she is looking all the time at her husband._

JINNY. Thank you, I've just left the Cullinghams. They sent word to you
they were going and would wait for you outside.

RUTH. Oh, then, I mustn't keep them waiting. We'll all meet at dinner
to-night, won't we? Good-by--good-by.

  [_With a grateful look at AUSTIN, she goes out Right._

JINNY. [_Watches her go; then turns to AUSTIN._] That wasn't true, what
I told her--I haven't seen the Cullinghams, and I don't know where they
are, and what's more, I don't care!

AUSTIN. What do you mean?

JINNY. [_Beginning by degrees to lose control of herself._] What did
_she_ mean by _following you_ to Rome?

AUSTIN. Jinny!

JINNY. Oh, don't try to deny it; that'll only make me suspect _you_!

AUSTIN. My dear girl, you don't know what you're saying!

JINNY. She's ill, they say at home! Yes, and they don't know what's the
matter with her, do they? No! But I can tell them! She's in love with
another woman's husband!

AUSTIN. [_Taking her hand._] Hush! I won't allow you to say such things!

JINNY. [_With a disagreeable little laugh._] Oh, won't you? _You'd_
better be careful,--my eyes are opened!

AUSTIN. Yes, and much too wide.

JINNY. A half-blind person would have known there was something between
you two. When I came into this room just now, it was in the air--it was
in both your faces!

  [_She sits on the bench._

AUSTIN. You've worked yourself up to such a pitch you're not responsible
for what you're saying!

JINNY. _I_ not _responsible_! What was it you were saying was _so_
"awful" when I came in here? "My God, so awful!"

  [_He doesn't answer._

  [_Almost hysterical, she rises._

She had told you she loved you! She'd confessed she'd followed you over
here!

AUSTIN. Absolutely false, _both_ your suppositions!

JINNY. Oh, of course you'd protect her; you're a gentleman! But if I
_thought_ you _knew_ she was coming over--

AUSTIN. Jinny! Jinny! How _can_ you have such a thought?

JINNY. Well, why didn't you tell me when you thought you saw her a
little while ago?

AUSTIN. Oh--

JINNY. Oh, it's very easy to say "Oh!" [_Imitating him._] but _why
didn't you_?

AUSTIN. I told you I didn't think who it was; I only thought something
familiar flashed across my eyes. Jinny darling, this is sheer madness on
your part, letting yourself go like this. It has no reason, it has no
excuse! Ask your own heart, and your own mind, if in speaking to _me_ as
you have, you haven't done me at least an injustice and my love for you
a _little_ wrong.

JINNY. Well, I'm sure _she's_ in love with you, anyway.

AUSTIN. No, she isn't! And it's disgraceful of you to say so! I know she
isn't--

JINNY. How do you know she isn't?

AUSTIN. There's no question of it. I'm sure of it! You mustn't think,
dear, that because _you_ love me, everybody does--you idealize me!

  [_Smiling apologetically._

JINNY. Oh, you're so modest you don't see! but I do--on the steamer, in
the hotels, everywhere we go, always, all the women admire you awfully!
I see it!

AUSTIN. [_Laughing._] What utter nonsense! [_Taking her into his arms._]
You've got something in your _eyes_!

JINNY. Only tears!

AUSTIN. No, something else,--something _green_.

JINNY. [_Laughs through her tears._] Somebody's told you my old
nickname!

AUSTIN. What?

JINNY. [_Laughs and is a little embarrassed._] The girl with the green
eyes.

AUSTIN. Ahem!--

JINNY. Well, I don't care if it is appropriate, I can't help it.

  [_Slipping from his arms._

AUSTIN. You must--or it will threaten our happiness if you let yourself
be carried away by jealousy for no earthly reason outside of your dear,
little imagination, like you have this time--

  [_Interrupted._

JINNY. You honestly don't think she cares for you?

AUSTIN. Not a bit!

JINNY. But what was it you were so serious about--what _is_ between you?

AUSTIN. She is in a little trouble, and I happen to know about it.

JINNY. How?

AUSTIN. [_After a second's hesitation._] That you mustn't ask me; it was
not from her I knew of it.

JINNY. Truly?

AUSTIN. Truly.

JINNY. I don't care, she hadn't any business to go to you! I should
think she'd have gone to a _woman_ instead of a _man_ for sympathy.
She's got Mrs. Cullingham!

AUSTIN. She can't go to her, poor girl. Mrs. Cullingham knows nothing
about it.

JINNY. Now don't you get too sympathetic--_that's very dangerous_!

AUSTIN. Look out, your imagination is peeping through the keyhole.

  [_A moment's pause._

JINNY. [_In a sympathetic tone, the jealousy gone._] What is her
trouble, Jack?

AUSTIN. That, dear, I can't tell you now; some day, perhaps, if you want
me to, but not now. Only I give you my word of honor, it has nothing to
do with you and me--does not touch our life! And I want you to tell me
you believe me, and _trust_ me, and won't let yourself be jealous again!

JINNY. I do believe you, and I do trust you, and I will _try_ not to be
jealous again!

AUSTIN. That's right.

JINNY. You know that book of De Maupassant's [_They move away
together._] I was reading in the train the other day,--about the young
girl who killed herself with charcoal fumes when her lover deserted her?

AUSTIN. [_Half laughing._] This is apropos of what, please? I have
absolutely _no_ sympathy with such people.

JINNY. In America that girl would have simply turned on the gas.

AUSTIN. You're getting morbid, Jinny!

JINNY. No, I'm not! but if ever--

AUSTIN. [_Interrupting--laughing it off_.] I shall install _electric
light_ as soon as we get home!

  [_They both laugh._

JINNY. I'm sorry I was so disagreeable to Ruth, but I'll try to make up
for it in every way I can.

  [_She sits on the bench and he leans over the back toward her._

AUSTIN. There's one other thing, Jinny, I'd like to speak of now. Would
you mind giving up the Lakes and going home this week?

JINNY. Going _home_--at once?

AUSTIN. Yes--_Wall Street_ is very uncertain. I'm worried,--I don't mind
telling you,--and I want to see Geoffrey about his business.

JINNY. [_Half in earnest._] Jack! You're not running away from _her_,
are you?

AUSTIN. Jinny! _After all_ we've said!

JINNY. No! I wasn't in earnest! I'm ready to go. I've seen the Lakes,
and whether you are in Italy or in New York, so long as we are together,
it's our honeymoon just the same.

AUSTIN. And may it last _all our lives_!

JINNY. Still, I don't mind owning up that leaving Ruth Chester behind
here is rather pleasanter! [_She rises quickly with a sudden thought._]
_She_ is not going back, too?

AUSTIN. Oh, no, not for a long time. They are over here indefinitely.

JINNY. I've been too horrid and nasty for words this morning, Jack--I'm
so sorry.

AUSTIN. It's over and forgotten now.

JINNY. You _do_ forgive me?

AUSTIN. Of course, dear; only I want to say this one thing to you: to
suspect unjustly a _true_ love is to insult that love!

JINNY. I didn't really suspect you.

AUSTIN. Of course I know you didn't; this is only by way of a
grandfatherly warning! It is possible to insult a true love too
often--and love can die--

JINNY. Sh! don't, please, say any more. You have forgiven me, haven't
you?

AUSTIN. Yes!

JINNY. Then kiss me!

AUSTIN. [_Smiling._] Here! My dear, some one will see us!

JINNY. No, only Apollo; see, there's no one else about--it's luncheon
hour!

AUSTIN. But--

  [_Taking her hand._

JINNY. [_Pulling him._] Come along, then, behind the statue. No one will
see us there!

  [_They are behind the statue a moment and then come around the other
  side._

JINNY. There! no one saw us, and I'm so _happy_, are you?

AUSTIN. _"So happy!"_

  [_JINNY takes his arm and they go to the Left entrance. She stops and
  looks up at him._

JINNY. Are my eyes _green_ now?

AUSTIN. Now they're _blue_!

JINNY. Hurrah! and I'm going, from now on, to be _so good_, you won't
know me.

  [_And hugging his arm tight they go out as_--

    THE CURTAIN FALLS




ACT III

(_Three weeks later_)


_The Austins' library; a warm, attractive room, with dark woodwork, and
  the walls hung in crimson brocade; Dutch marqueterie furniture; blue
  and white china on the mantel and tops of the book shelves; carbon
  photographs of pictures by Reynolds, Ronney, and Gainsborough on the
  wall. There is a double window at the back. A door at Right leads to
  the hall, and another on the Left side of the room leads to JINNY's
  own room. MRS. TILLMAN sits at a pianola Right, playing "Tell me,
  Pretty Maiden"; she stops once in a while, showing that she is
  unaccustomed to the instrument. JINNY enters from Left, singing as
  her mother plays._

JINNY. Darling mother!

  [_She puts her arms about her and kisses her._

  [_They come away from the pianola together, to a big arm-chair._

MRS. TILLMAN. I really must get one of those sewing-machine pianos for
your father. I believe even he could play it, and it would be lots of
amusement for us.

JINNY. Jack adores it; I gave it to him for an anniversary present.

MRS. TILLMAN. What anniversary?

  [_Sitting in the chair._

JINNY. Day before yesterday. The eleventh Tuesday since our marriage.
Have you been in town all day? I _am_ glad to see you!

  [_She sits on the arm of the chair with her arm about her mother._

MRS. TILLMAN. Yes, and I told your father to meet me here and we'd take
the six-thirty train from Long Island City.

JINNY. Jack and I are going to the theatre to-night.

MRS. TILLMAN. I thought they were all closed!

JINNY. Oh, no, there are several musical comedies on,--Jack's favorite
form of amusement,--and I've bought the tickets myself for a sort of
birthday party.

MRS. TILLMAN. Is it his birthday?

JINNY. No, that's only my excuse!

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Laughing._] Had we dreamed you and Jack were coming home
in June, your father and I wouldn't have gone into the country so early.

JINNY. We've been home two weeks and it hasn't been hot yet.

MRS. TILLMAN. And you're still ideally happy aren't you, darling?

JINNY. Yes--

  [_She rises and goes to a table near the centre of the room and looks
  at the titles of several books without realizing what they are._

MRS. TILLMAN. Why, Jinny,--what does that mean?

JINNY. Oh, it's all my horrid disposition!

MRS. TILLMAN. Been seeing green?

JINNY. Um! Um! Once in Rome, and on the steamer, and again since we've
been back.

MRS. TILLMAN. Nothing serious?

JINNY. [_Hesitatingly, she turns and faces her mother._] No--but the
last time Jack was harder to bring around than before, and he looked at
me for fully five minutes without a particle of love in his eyes, and
they were almost--_dead_ eyes!

MRS. TILLMAN. What was it all about?

JINNY. Ruth Chester, principally.

MRS. TILLMAN. Why Ruth?

JINNY. Well, the first real scene I made was in Rome in the Vatican. I
was jealous of her; I can't explain it all to you--as a matter of fact,
it hasn't been all explained to _me_! Something was troubling Ruth that
Jack knew, and he said he'd help her.

MRS. TILLMAN. What?

JINNY. That's just it; Jack won't tell me. And the day we sailed from
Naples a telegram came, and of course I opened it, and it said, "Trust
me, I will do everything you say. Ruth."

MRS. TILLMAN. Why haven't you told me anything of all this before, dear?

JINNY. [_Going back to her mother._] I was ashamed to! Somehow, in the
end I always knew I was wrong and had hurt him--hurt him terribly,
mother, the man I love better than everything else in the world! Yes,
even better than you and father and Geoffrey--all together!

  [_In her mother's arms, crying a little._

MRS. TILLMAN. Oh, this curse of jealousy! I was in hopes he was so
strong he would help you to overcome it.

JINNY. He does try hard, I can see sometimes; but he hasn't a spark of
it in him, and he can't understand it, and I know I'm unreasonable, and
before I know it I am saying things I don't know what, and some day he
won't forgive them! I'm sure some day he won't!--

  [_Breaking down again._

  [_She rises and turns away._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Rising and putting her arms about her._] Come, dear! Now
you're getting yourself all unstrung, and that won't do you any good;
you've got to fight this battle out, I'm afraid, by yourself, trusting
in the deep love of your husband to teach him forbearance. Your father's
and my troubles were never very big because we _shared_ the curse, so we
knew how to sympathize with each other!

JINNY. What an awful thing it is!

MRS. TILLMAN. Yes, my dear child. Jealousy has no saving grace, and it
only destroys what is always most precious to you. Jinny, don't let it
destroy _your best_ happiness!

JINNY. Mother, if it _should_, I'd kill myself!

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Shocked, but quite disbelieving her._] My dear!

  [_MAGGIE enters Right._

MAGGIE. Mr. Tillman is downstairs, madam.

MRS. TILLMAN. Tell him to come up.

MAGGIE. Yes, madam.

  [_She goes out Right._

JINNY. Don't tell father anything before me.

MRS. TILLMAN. I don't know that I shall tell him at all; he would only
advise more cigars!

  [_TILLMAN enters Right._

  [_MRS. TILLMAN sits on the sofa at Left._

TILLMAN. Are you here?

JINNY. [_Going to meet him._] We are, father dear, and your presence
_almost_ completes us. [_Kisses him._] I say _almost_, because Jack
hasn't come up town yet, and Geoffrey's heartless enough to stay on
fishing at Cape Cod!

TILLMAN. No, he isn't; he's back to-day.

  [_He sits in the arm-chair at Right._

JINNY. Oh, I do want to see him!

  [_Sitting near her father._

TILLMAN. He ought to have been in by now--I met them this morning. He
was to lunch with Jack, and he's going to put up for a few days at the
University.

JINNY. He must dine with us every night.

TILLMAN. Jinny!-- [_Looking at her._] --You look as if you've been
crying!

  [_The two WOMEN are embarrassed, and JINNY doesn't reply._

TILLMAN. [_Hurt._] Oh, if you prefer to have secrets from your father,
it's all right! _I don't begrudge_ your mother her _first place_ in your
affections!

JINNY. Not at all, father; with you and mother there's no first place.
She will tell you all about it on the way home! Please, mother.

MRS. TILLMAN. Very well, dear.

TILLMAN. A little "scrap" between you and Jack?

JINNY. Yes, but it's all over!

TILLMAN. Um!-- [_Thinks a second, then taking out his cigar case, he
empties it of cigars and hands them to JINNY._] Give your husband these,
please, when he comes in!

  [_JINNY and her MOTHER exchange a smile._

JINNY. But, father, Jack's got boxes full--

TILLMAN. Never mind; give him those, _from me, with my compliments_!

JINNY. [_Laughing._] Very well!

TILLMAN. How are you and Maggie getting on?

JINNY. Splendidly.

MRS. TILLMAN. Such a nice girl!

JINNY. And wasn't it odd Jack was bitterly opposed to my taking her?

MRS. TILLMAN. My dear, if we hadn't lent her to you for these few weeks,
you wouldn't have got anybody decent for so short a time.

TILLMAN. Why didn't Jack want her to come?

JINNY. I don't know, he just didn't want her; and then last week he
talked with her in the library for three-quarters of an hour by my
watch.

MRS. TILLMAN. Why?

JINNY. Oh, it seems _she_ has troubles, too! All single young women with
troubles, of no matter what class, seem to make a bee line for my
husband, even if they have to cross the ocean!

TILLMAN. What do you mean?

JINNY. [_Half laughing._] Oh, nothing, but it was about that talk with
Maggie that we had our last quarrel.

  [_MAGGIE enters Right._

MAGGIE. Mrs. Cullingham.

  [_A second's dead silence, the announcement falling like a bombshell._

JINNY. [_Astounded._] _Who?_

  [_She rises._

TILLMAN AND MRS. TILLMAN. _Who?_

MAGGIE. Mrs. Cullingham and her son, madam.

JINNY. They're in Europe.

MRS. TILLMAN. Are you sure you're not mistaken, Maggie?

MAGGIE. Oh, yes'm. Even if you _could_ mistake Mrs. Cullingham, you
couldn't mistake Mr. Peter!

JINNY. Ask them to please come up, Maggie.

MAGGIE. Yes'm.

  [_She goes out Right._

TILLMAN. Why, they only just sailed the other day, didn't they?

MRS. TILLMAN. Yes, and they were supposed to be gone all summer at
least, for Ruth Chester's health! What in the world can they have come
back for?

JINNY. [_With curious determination._] _That_ is what _I_ intend to find
out.

TILLMAN. [_Rising._] We must be going, Susan; we've lost our train as it
is.

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Rising._] We can take the seven-two.

  [_MAGGIE shows in MRS. CULLINGHAM and PETER. PETER shakes hands with
  MRS. TILLMAN, then with JINNY, and then with MR. TILLMAN._

  [_MRS. CULLINGHAM kisses MRS. TILLMAN and shakes hands with MR.
  TILLMAN._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Jinny, you angel, aren't you surprised!

  [_Kissing her._

JINNY. Well, rather!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Well, you aren't a bit more surprised than I am. [_A
clock strikes six-thirty._] There goes the half hour, Peter; you must
take your powder.

PETER. I beg your pardon, mother; it's the tablet now.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Excuse me, dear, I'm so dead tired.

  [_Sits on the sofa._

JINNY. [_To Peter._] Will you have some water?

PETER. No, thank you, I've learned now to take them _au naturel_, and
without much, if any, inconvenience!

  [_Takes his tablet with still a certain amount of difficulty, and sits
  Right._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_To MRS. CULLINGHAM._] Did you have a bad voyage?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. No, perfectly beautiful!

PETER. [_Reproachfully, and with a final swallow._] Oh, mother!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Except, of course, for poor Peter; he gets worse every
trip! He can eat _absolutely nothing_--that is _for long_! But it's the
Custom House that's worn me out; I was there from twelve till four.

MRS. TILLMAN. But you wouldn't have had time to buy anything!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Of course not! But I took plenty of new dresses for the
entire summer; most of them hadn't been worn, and they were determined
to make me pay duty.

JINNY. We had to pay awfully for things! I wanted to try and smuggle,
but Jack wouldn't let me!

MR. TILLMAN. I'm afraid _we_ must go!

  [_ALL rise._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. What do you think the Inspector had the impudence to
ask me finally,--if I wanted to bring the dresses in as theatrical
properties!

  [_They laugh._

MRS. TILLMAN. You must have some _gorgeous_ frocks!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh, there are some _paillettes_! But who do you suppose
he took me for--Sarah Bernhardt!

TILLMAN. [_Looking at his watch._] I don't wish to interrupt this vital
political conversation, but, Susan, if you don't want to miss the
seven-two train, too--!

MRS. TILLMAN. [_Rising._] Oh, no, we mustn't do that. Good-by. [_To MRS.
CULLINGHAM, shaking hands._] It's nice to see you again, anyway. Is Ruth
better?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I'm sorry to say--I don't think she is--good-by.

  [_To MR. TILLMAN, who says good-by_--_general good-bys._

MRS. TILLMAN. [_To JINNY._] You want me to tell your father?

JINNY. Yes, it's better; it does make him jealous if he thinks I tell
you things and keep secrets from him.

TILLMAN. Good-by, Peter.

MRS. TILLMAN. Good-by, Peter.

PETER. By-by.

  [_MR. and MRS. TILLMAN quickly go out Right, JINNY going to the door
  with them._

JINNY. [_Coming back from doorway._] Now do tell me what it means. I
thought you were abroad indefinitely, or for the summer at least.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. So did I! I'm just as surprised to be here as you _seem
to be_! [_They sit down near each other._] Didn't you really know we
were coming?

JINNY. No! How should I?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I don't know--I thought--

  [_She hesitates, embarrassed._

  [_After a pause._

JINNY. What did you think?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Nothing, except that you must know we were coming home.

JINNY. Why--that _I_ must?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. You mustn't put me into a corner like that!

JINNY. How do you mean "corner"? How did you happen to come home like
this?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Ruth suddenly got a cable--she didn't tell me from
whom--but she said she must go home at once.

JINNY. But her mother's never been better!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Carelessly._] The cable wasn't from her mother.

JINNY. Oh, then, you know who it was from? [_No answer._] Oh, I see now
why you thought I ought to know about it; the cable was from _Jack_,
_wasn't it_?

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Relieved._] Yes.

JINNY. Oh, it was!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I looked at it when she was out of the room; of course,
it was sort of by accident-- [_Very much embarrassed._] --that is,
I just happened to see--O dear, there! You know what I mean; it was
dreadful of me, but I couldn't help it.

JINNY. [_In a strained voice._] Jack and Ruth are very good friends and
he looks after some of her affairs. You know having no man in the family
complicates things.

PETER. Oh! I say!

  [_Standing up, suddenly._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. What _is it_, dear?

PETER. I believe I haven't got my before-dinner tabs.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Oh, look carefully!

PETER. [_He looks in his right-hand pocket, takes out a bottle._] Soda
mints! [_From his left-hand pocket a box._] Alkali powders! [_From third
pocket a bottle._] Charcoal tablets! [_From fourth pocket another
bottle._] Dr. Man's Positive Cure! [_From fifth pocket a box._]
Bicarbonate soda!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. There's your other side pocket!

PETER. That's my saccharine [_Showing bottle._] and my lithia tabs.
[_Showing another bottle._] We'll have to go, mother; I've left them
home!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. We must go, anyway, my dear.

  [_Rising._

  [_JINNY also rises._

PETER. [_Suddenly claps his hand behind him and speaks joyfully._] No,
we needn't go after all; I forgot my hip pocket. Here they are!

  [_Bringing them out._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. We must go all the same! [_To JINNY._] Sometimes I
think he takes too much medicine stuff!

JINNY. I should think so! Peter, you ought to diet.

PETER. I can't! I've tried, and I lose my appetite right away!

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Good-by, dear. How long will you be in town?

JINNY. I don't know--several weeks, I imagine. Jack came home on some
business, you know, and I don't think it's settled yet. Good-by.

  [_To PETER._

PETER. Good-by. You know you mustn't drink water with your meals; that's
the great thing. So I drink only champagne.

  [_He goes out Right._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. [_Waits and speaks to JINNY with real feeling._] I'm
awfully ashamed of myself, and I hope I haven't made any trouble or fuss
with my meddling. Don't let me!

JINNY. No, of course not.

  [_With a strained smile._

MRS. CULLINGHAM. I wish I could believe you.

JINNY. Well, _do_.

MRS. CULLINGHAM. Good-by.

  [_She goes out Right._

JINNY. Good-by. Where's that telegram that came for him a little while
ago? [_Going to the desk at Right, and finding the telegram._] Of course
it's from her, saying that she's arrived. That's the trouble with
telegrams; the address doesn't give the handwriting away. She must have
sent it from the dock! Couldn't even wait till she was home! [_She walks
to the window and stands there a moment, then comes back, looking at her
watch._] Nearly seven already, and no sign of him, and we must dress and
dine--huh! I think I might as well tear up my theatre tickets! [_She
paces up and down the room, stopping now and then with each new thought
that comes to her._] I wonder if he went down there to meet her--he must
have known the boat; if he cabled her to come back, she must have cabled
an answer and what boat she'd take! But no other telegram has come for
Jack here to my knowledge--oh! of course, what am I thinking of, she
sent _that one_ to _his office_ to-day; she was afraid he might have
left before this one could get there, so she risked it here. Good
Heavens! why am I maudling on like this to myself out loud? It's really
nothing--Jack will _explain_ once more that he _can't_ explain, but that
Ruth has "troubles," and I'll believe him again! But I won't! He
promised me she should stay over there! [_Looks at her watch again._]
He's there, with her! _Nothing ever_ kept him half as late down town as
this! What a little fool I am!

  [_GEOFFREY enters suddenly Right._

JINNY. [_Cries out, joyfully._] Geoffrey! [_And rushing to him, embraces
him._] You brute, you, not to come straight back to New York when you
heard I was home! You dear old darling, you!

GEOFFREY. I couldn't, old girl; there were reasons--I don't have to tell
you I wanted to.

JINNY. I don't know! Was there a pretty girl up there, Geof? I'm sure I
shouldn't think her pretty if you were in love with her. I believe I
shall be awfully jealous of your wife when you get one!

GEOFFREY. Rubbish! Hasn't Jack come back yet?

JINNY. "Come back" from where?

GEOFFREY. Brooklyn.

JINNY. Brooklyn! Why, he told me--what did he go there for?

GEOFFREY. [_Embarrassed._] I don't know if you don't--

JINNY. You _do_!!

GEOFFREY. No--really--I--

JINNY. Oh, it's something to be concealed, then?

GEOFFREY. Hang it, Jinny! drop the subject. I thought he said he was
going to Brooklyn; probably I was mistaken.

JINNY. [_Satirically._] One is so apt to think just casually that every
one's going to Brooklyn! [_Looks at her watch._] Of course it's
Brooklyn. [_Goes and looks at the telegram; turns._] So you're going
back on _me_, too, are you? You're going to _protect Jack_ at _my_
expense!

  [_AUSTIN enters Right._

AUSTIN. [_Absorbed._] Good evening, Jinny dear.

JINNY. It's after seven!

AUSTIN. [_Pleasantly._] Is it? Have you been waiting long, Geoffrey?

GEOFFREY. No, I've only just now come in.

JINNY. It's _I_ who have done the waiting!

AUSTIN. I'm sorry, but it couldn't be helped.

JINNY. You didn't tell me you were going to Brooklyn.

AUSTIN. [_After a quick, sharp look at Geoffrey, who shakes his head
once emphatically._] It must have escaped my mind.

JINNY. That's very likely! Going to Brooklyn's the sort of thing one
talks about and dreads for days.

AUSTIN. Well, Jinny, that will bear postponement, and my conversation
with Geoffrey won't; will you please leave us together here for a while?

JINNY. And what about the theatre?

AUSTIN. What theatre?

JINNY. Oh, you've _forgotten_ entirely my little birthday party! Thanks!

AUSTIN. Oh, Jinny! I _did_! Forgive me! I'm awfully sorry! I've got a
lot on my mind to-day.

  [_Tries to put his arms about her and kiss her. She pushes herself
  away from him, refusing to let him kiss her._

JINNY. Yes--I know you have-- [_At door Left._] --I'll leave you two to
your confidences. You can trust Geof; he just now refused to betray you.

  [_AUSTIN only looks at her fixedly, seriously. She looks back at him
  with bravado. Then she deliberately crosses the room, gets the cable,
  and recrosses with it and goes out Left._

AUSTIN. Poor Jinny! [_Turning to GEOFFREY._] and that, too, lies largely
on your already overcrowded shoulders.

GEOFFREY. [_Breaking down._] I know! I know!

AUSTIN. [_Sitting in the corner of the sofa._] Here, don't cry! You've
got to be strong now, and you've no use nor time for crying. I've had
another long interview with the Brooklyn minister.

GEOFFREY. Yes?--

AUSTIN. [_Drawing a chair near to him and sitting._] Well, of course we
both know that he's doing wrong to keep silent, but he will. He wishes I
hadn't told him, because he thinks he'd never have noticed your divorce
from Maggie when it was granted--nor remembered your name if he had seen
it in the papers.

GEOFFREY. That's what I _told_ you!

AUSTIN. _You_ only argued that for fear I'd insist on _your_ going to
this minister yourself. But in the bottom of your heart you know it was
a risk we couldn't afford to run. I've explained everything to him--how
such a fine, sweet girl would suffer if he did expose you, and I gave
him my word you would be remarried to Ruth at once after the divorce. Of
course we both know it's wrong, but we both hope the end justifies the
means that removes difficulty number two.

GEOFFREY. You're sure about Maggie?

AUSTIN. She's signed a paper; she realizes you'll never live with her,
and--it's pathetic--she loves you--that girl, too--so much as to give
you your freedom--Good Lord! what is it about you weak men that wins
women so? What is it in _you_ that has made two women love _you_ to such
a self-sacrificing extent?

GEOFFREY. [_Half tragic, half comic laugh._] I give it up!

AUSTIN. [_Bitterly._] So do I. Well, Maggie is to have six hundred
dollars a year.

GEOFFREY. Where'll I get it?

AUSTIN. We'll talk about that when the time comes. [_He rises._] _Now_
the most important, the most painful, task of all must be done and _you_
must do it. _Not I this time--you!_

GEOFFREY. [_Looking up, frightened._] What?

AUSTIN. Ruth Chester landed this morning.

GEOFFREY. [_Starting up._] Impossible!

  [_Rising._

AUSTIN. The moment Maggie signed my paper I cabled Miss Chester to
return. You can't go out west and institute proceedings for divorce
without her _knowing the whole truth from you_ first! You don't want her
to find it out from the newspapers, do you?

GEOFFREY. And you want _me_ to tell her?

AUSTIN. _To-day._ And to-morrow you start west!

GEOFFREY. [_Facing AUSTIN._] I _won't_ tell her!

AUSTIN. [_Calmly._] You've got to!

Geoffrey. I'd rather shoot myself; do you understand me--I'd rather
shoot myself!

AUSTIN. That's nothing! That would be decidedly the _easiest_ course out
of it, _and_ the most _cowardly_.

GEOFFREY. She'll hate me! She'll loathe me! How could she help it at
first! But just after a little, if I weren't there, the love she has for
me might move her somehow or other--and by degrees perhaps--to forgive--

AUSTIN. I don't deny that you will have to go through a terrible
degradation with her--but that is nothing compared with what you
deserve. If _you_ tell her, at least the humiliation is secret, locked
there between you two, and no one else in the world can ever know what
happens; _but_ if you send some one else, and no matter who,--_any one_
else but you _is_ an outsider,--you ask her to make a spectacle of her
humiliation, to let a third in as witness to the relations and emotions
between you two! It's insulting her _again_! Don't you _see_?

  [_A pause._

GEOFFREY. Yes, I see! My God! I _must_ tell her myself.

AUSTIN. That's right, don't waver, make up your mind and do it--Come!

  [_Urging him up._

GEOFFREY. [_Hesitates a moment._] And Jinny?

AUSTIN. Oh, she'll come round all right; she always does.

GEOFFREY. And she doesn't suspect?

AUSTIN. Not the slightest.

  [_A pause._

GEOFFREY. Need she?

AUSTIN. The worst? No, _never_!

GEOFFREY. [_He rises, with new encouragement._] You'll give me your
word?

AUSTIN. Yes. [_Shakes his hand._] I know how much she loves you; _I_
wouldn't have her know anything. It's made us some ugly scenes, but they
soon pass, and when you are once out of your trouble for good, we'll
have no excuse, I'm sure, for any more!

GEOFFREY. Then I shall go to bed to-night with the respect still of at
least two women who are dear to me, my mother and Jinny, even if I lose
the respect and love of the one woman who is dearer! Only think, Jack,
how I've got to stand up there--never mind about myself--and make _her
suffer tortures_! Good-by. God give me courage to do the heart-breaking
thing I must do.

AUSTIN. I am sure the one hope you have of forgiveness is in your
manliness of going to her as you are doing and telling her yourself
_all_ the truth!

GEOFFREY. And that, like everything else, I owe to you.

AUSTIN. No, to _Jinny_! Good luck!

  [_He shakes GEOFFREY'S hand and GEOFFREY goes out Right._

AUSTIN. [_Goes to the door Left, opens it, and calls to JINNY, in the
next room._] Jinny, Geoffrey's gone,--what are you doing?

JINNY. [_Answers in a very little staccato voice._] Waiting till you
should have the leisure to receive me!

AUSTIN. Come along!

  [_Leaves the doorway._

  [_JINNY enters Left and stands in the doorway._

JINNY. [_With affected nonchalance._] I didn't care to go downstairs for
dinner, so I have had a tray up here. Maggie brought up something for
you, too; would you like it now?

AUSTIN. [_Ignoring purposely her mood and manner._] I shouldn't mind! I
do feel a little hungry.

  [_He sits in the arm-chair._

JINNY. [_Speaks off through the doorway Left._] Bring in the tray for
Mr. Austin, Maggie.

MAGGIE. [_Off stage._] Yes'm.

  [_JINNY pulls forward a little tea table beside his chair. Her whole
  manner must be one of slow, dragging carelessness, like the calm
  before a storm. Her expression must be hard. She carries the telegram
  still unopened, and on top of it the theatre tickets torn into
  pieces._

  [_MAGGIE brings in the tray, puts it on the table, and goes out Right.
  On the tray are chops, peas, some whiskey, a syphon, a roll, etc._

AUSTIN. [_Sits down quickly and with a show of eagerness._] Ah!

  [_Begins to eat as if he were hungry and enjoyed it._

  [_JINNY sits on the sofa at his Left, and looks at him,--AUSTIN is of
  course conscious of JINNY'S mood, but pretends not to notice it._

AUSTIN. [_After a silence during which he eats._] I say I _am_ hungry!
And these chops _are_ very good, aren't they?

  [_No answer._

I'll tell you what it is, Jinny! Of course travelling is great sport and
all the rest of it, but after all one does get tired of hotels, and to
quote a somewhat familiar refrain, "There's no place like home."

  [_No answer._

Have you a headache, Jinny?

JINNY. [_Very short._] No.

AUSTIN. That's a good thing, and I hope you are not as disappointed as I
am about the theatre.

JINNY. [_Half laughs._] Humph!

AUSTIN. I'll celebrate _your_ birthday to-morrow and take _you_.

JINNY. [_Quickly._] _Why_ did you go to Brooklyn?

AUSTIN. On the private business of some one else.

JINNY. [_With all her nerves tied tight._] That's the best answer you
will give me?

AUSTIN. My dear girl, it's the only answer I _can_ give you.

JINNY. When you are through I have something for you!

AUSTIN. What?

JINNY. I'll give it to you when you have finished.

AUSTIN. I'm ready. [_He rises. JINNY rises too, and gives him the
telegram with the torn tickets on top, and then rings the bell, at
Right._] What are these torn papers?

JINNY. Our theatre tickets!

  [_He looks at her._

AUSTIN. And when did this telegram come?

JINNY. This afternoon.

AUSTIN. Why didn't I get it when I came in?

JINNY. [_Bitingly._] I kept it to have the _pleasure_ of giving it to
you myself; it's from Ruth Chester.

AUSTIN. How do you know?

JINNY. Oh, I haven't opened it! But I know! When I held it in my hand it
burnt my fingers! [_MAGGIE enters Right._] Take away the tray, please,
Maggie.

MAGGIE. Yes'm.

  [_She leaves the room with the tray._

  [_JINNY replaces the small table carelessly, almost roughly._

  [_AUSTIN opens and reads the telegram; there is a second's pause._

JINNY. May I read it?

AUSTIN. [_After a moment's hesitation._] Yes, if you wish.

  [_Not handing it to her._

JINNY. I _do_!

AUSTIN. [_Reaches over and hands her the telegram; he speaks quietly._]
When you behave like this it's impossible for me to feel the same toward
you.

JINNY. And how do you think I feel when I read this?

  [_Reads it, satirically, bitterly._

"Arrived safely; please let me see you before the day goes. Ruth."
"_Ruth_" if you please!

AUSTIN. [_Standing over JINNY._] I want you to be careful to-night. I
want you to control yourself. I've been through a great deal to-day, and
if you make me angry God knows what I mightn't say and _do_!

JINNY. And _I've_ been through a great deal _for many a day now_, and I
want the truth about this at last! It's all very well for you to spare
her by not telling me what this _mysterious_ trouble is about which
you've been hoodwinking me ever since we were married, but _now_ you've
got to choose between sparing _her_ and sparing _me_!

  [_She sits determinedly._

AUSTIN. Is this your answer to me when I beg you to be very careful
to-night to control yourself?

JINNY. It's your turn to be careful! What did you marry me for if you
were in love with Ruth?

AUSTIN. _Jinny!_

JINNY. [_A little frightened, to excuse herself._] You gave me your word
of honor she would stay abroad indefinitely.

AUSTIN. Nonsense! I said I understood she was going to stay some
time--indefinitely.

JINNY. It's the same thing, and here she is back practically the moment
we are!

AUSTIN. I can't control Miss Chester's movements--I couldn't foresee
when she would come back. In Rome she told me she would stay on.

JINNY. [_Rising and facing him._] Ah! that's what I wanted to see, if
you really _would lie_ to me!

AUSTIN. What do you mean?

JINNY. [_Beside herself._] Liar! [_He only looks at her, with his face
hard and set; she is insane with jealousy for the moment._] _You sent_
for Ruth to come back.

AUSTIN. _And_ if _I did_?

JINNY. You tried to deceive me about it. And if you'll tell me a lie
about one thing, you'll tell me a lie about another, and I don't believe
one word of all your explanations about the intrigue between you and
Ruth Chester!

AUSTIN. [_Taking her two hands._] Sit down!

  [_She sits in the arm-chair, half forced by him._

JINNY. _Why_ did you send for Ruth Chester to come back?

AUSTIN. I have told you before, I am trying to help Miss Chester.

JINNY. "_Ruth!_"

AUSTIN. I am trying to help her in a great and serious trouble.

JINNY. Why did you send for her to come back? What's the trouble?

AUSTIN. I've told you before I can't tell you.

JINNY. You daren't tell me, and you haven't even the face to tell
another lie about it!

AUSTIN. If you say another word, I shall _hate_ you! If you _won't_
control _yourself_, I must make you, as well as keep my own sane
balance. You have insulted my love for you to-night as you've never done
before; you've struck at my own ideal of _you_; you've almost done, in a
word, what I warned you you might do--_kill_ the love I have for you!

JINNY. [_Frightened._] Jack!

AUSTIN. I mean what I say!

JINNY. [_In tears._] That--that you--you don't love me?

AUSTIN. That is not what I said, but I tell you now that since I first
began to care for you, never have I loved you so little as I do
to-night.

JINNY. [_With an effort at angry justification._] And suppose I tell you
it is your own fault, because you haven't treated me--

AUSTIN. [_Interrupting her._] Like a _child_, instead of a _woman_!

JINNY. No, because you've kept part of yourself from me, and that part
you've given--

AUSTIN. For God's sake, stop! [_A pause--JINNY is now thoroughly
frightened; slowly she comes to her senses._] Do you _want_ a rupture
for good between us? [_No answer._] Can't you see what I tell you is
true? That I can't bear any more to-night? That if you keep on you will
rob _me_ of every bit of love I have for you, just as you've already
robbed me of the woman I thought you were?

JINNY. "Already!" No, no, Jack, don't say that. Oh, what have I done!

  [_She cries._

AUSTIN. You've done something very serious, and before you do
more-- [_Speaking hardly._] --I think we'd better not stay in this
evening; it would be wiser for both of us if we went out somewhere.

JINNY. No, I couldn't go out feeling this way! I've hurt you, hurt you
terribly! Oh, why do I do it? Why can't I help myself?

AUSTIN. I think one more scene to-night would finish things for us. I
_warn_ you of that, Jinny--

  [_He goes to the desk and sits at it, looking blankly before him. She
  comes slowly, almost timidly, behind his chair._

JINNY. No, don't say it! don't say it! Try to forgive me--oh, Jack, I
hate myself, and I'm so ashamed of myself! I know I've disappointed you
awfully, awfully! You _did_ idealize me; I knew it when you married me,
but I told you then I wasn't worth your loving me, didn't I? I never
pretended to be worthy of you. I always knew I wasn't.

AUSTIN. Hush!

JINNY. It's true! it's only too awfully true. But do you remember how
you answered me then when I told you I wasn't worth your loving me?

AUSTIN. [_Coldly and without looking at her._] No.

JINNY. You took me in your arms and held me so I couldn't have got away
if I'd wanted to--which I didn't--and stopped the words on my lips with
your _kisses_. [_Her throat fills. He makes no reply. She goes on very
pathetically._] _How I wish_ you'd answer me that way now!

AUSTIN. Whose fault is it?

JINNY. Oh, mine! _mine_! I know it. _You_ don't know it one-half so well
as I! I love you better than anything in the world, love everything of
you--the turn of your head, the blessed touch of your hand, the smallest
word that comes from your dear lips--the thoughts that your forehead
hides, but which my heart guesses when I'm sane! And yet, try as hard as
I can, these mad fits take hold of me, and although I'd willingly _die_
to save you _pain_, still _I_, _I_ myself, hurt and wound you past all
bearing! It doesn't make any difference that _I_ suffer too! _I ought_
to! I deserve to--you _don't_! Oh, no! I know I'm a disappointment and a
failure!

  [_Her eyes fill up with tears and her voice breaks._

AUSTIN. [_He turns to her._] No, Jinny, not so bad as that, only I
thought you were _big_--and you're _so little_, oh, _so small_!

JINNY. Yes, it's true; I'm small--I'm _small_! Oh, I'd like to be big,
too! I want to be noble and strong, but I'm not--I'm as weak as
water--only it's _boiling_ water! I want to be Brunhilde, and I'm only
Frou Frou! Yes, I'm little; but I _love_ you--_I love you!_

  [_She sinks on to a stool beside him. A moment's pause._

  [_With a trembling voice._

You don't mind my sitting here?

AUSTIN. No--

  [_Very quietly, he places his arm about her neck, his hand on her
  shoulder. She quickly steals up her hand to take his, and leaning
  her head over it, kisses his hand. He draws it away and kisses her
  hair._

JINNY. [_Timidly, very softly._] You forgive me?

AUSTIN. [_With a long sigh._] Yes.

JINNY. [_Bursting into tears and burying her face upon his knees._]
Thank you--thank you--I know I don't deserve it--I don't deserve it--I
don't deserve it!

AUSTIN. [_Softly._] Sh!--

  [_JINNY half turns and looks up at him._

JINNY. [_Very, very quietly._] You forgive me--but still--yes, I see it
in your face, you don't love me the same. You look so tired, dear.

AUSTIN. [_Also very quietly._] I am, Jinny.

JINNY. And--happy?

AUSTIN. I'm _not_ quite happy.

JINNY. I wish I could make you so--make you love me the old way. You
used to smile a little when you looked at me--Jack, you don't any more.
But I mean to make you to-night, if I can, and to make you love me as
much as ever you did.

AUSTIN. Good luck, dear.

JINNY. [_Brightening._] What time is it?

AUSTIN. [_Looking at his watch._] Nearly nine.

JINNY. I suppose it is too late for me to dress and for us to go to the
theatre?

AUSTIN. Oh, yes,--and I'm too tired.

JINNY. [_Triumphantly._] Well, then, you shall have your theatre at
home! If Mahomet won't go to the mountain, the mountain must go to your
lordship!

AUSTIN. I don't understand!

JINNY. Well, just wait-- [_She blows her nose._] --till I bathe my face
and eyes a little; I feel rather bleary! [_Starting to go, she stops and
turns._] Good-by?

  [_Questioningly._

AUSTIN. [_Quietly._] Good-by.

JINNY. [_Who wanted him to call her to him and kiss her._] Oh, very
well! but I'll _make_ you smile yet and _kiss_ me of your own accord
to-night--you'll see!

  [_She goes out Left._

[_She is heard singing in her room. AUSTIN goes to the desk and after a
long sigh he begins to write._]

AUSTIN. [_Writing._] Dear Ruth. The satisfaction of the visit to
Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your
telegram till too late to go to your house to-night. My heart aches for
the blow you must have this evening, but please God you will bear it
bravely. The man who loves you is not bad, but he has been weak.
However, I feel once he can shake off the burden of his present
marriage, you will never have cause to complain of him again. And if
your future happiness lies truly in his hands, it will be safe there.

JINNY. [_Calls from her room._] Are you ready?

AUSTIN. Yes.

  [_He stops writing._

JINNY. In your orchestra chair?

AUSTIN. Yes.

JINNY. What will you have, tragedy or comedy?

AUSTIN. [_Smiling._] Shall we begin with tragedy?

JINNY. All right.

AUSTIN. [_Continues to write._] So far I have been able to keep Jinny in
absolute ignorance, but I fear the blow must fall upon her soon, and I
dread to think of what she, too, will suffer. Help me to keep it from
her as long as we can, won't you?

  [_JINNY comes back; she has changed her dress to a loose negligee
  gown, with a red turban on her head; she brings two sheets with her._

JINNY. Excuse me one minute while I set the stage! [_Moving toward each
other the big arm-chair and the sofa, she covers them with the sheets.
AUSTIN turns from his letter on the desk, to watch._] Uncle Tom's Cabin,
Act Four! [_She goes out only for a moment, and reenters, wearing a
man's overcoat, with a pillow tied in the middle with a silk scarf,
eyes, nose, and mouth made on it with a burnt match._] Eliza crossing
the ice! Come, honey darling! [_To the pillow._] Mammy'll save you from
de wicked white man! [_Jumping up on the sofa, and moving with the
springs._] _You_ ought to do the bloodhounds for me, Jack! Excuse me,
but you look the part! [_AUSTIN watches her, not unamused, but without
smiling._] Hold tight to Lize, honey, and don't be afeerd o' dat big
black man over dah--dat's Uncle Tom. [_Crossing to the arm-chair._]
Don't be afeerd, honey; it's Lize dat's cuttin' de ice this time. [_She
throws the pillow away and drags off the two sheets._] Oh, I can see
this is too serious for you!

  [_She starts singing a cakewalk and dances across the room until she
  reaches him, where she finishes._

AUSTIN. Very good, Jinny! I'm sure we couldn't have seen better at the
theatre.

JINNY. Ah! You're getting yourself again!--Darling! Come!--Come!--come
to the pianola and you shall have the sextette! It's in there ready; I
heard mother struggling with it. You don't suppose she has designs upon
the Casino, do you? Now--ready?

  [_He goes to the pianola and starts to play the sextette from
  "Florodora." She runs to the opposite side of the room and begins
  to sing and dance, crossing to AUSTIN as he plays._

AUSTIN. [_After a few moments._] But I can't see you and play at the
same time; I don't like it!

JINNY. [_Delighted._] You _want to see me_, do you?

AUSTIN. Of course I do!

JINNY. Jack! [_Delighted._] Well, then, turn round!

  [_JINNY, hurrying the time of the song, turns it into a regular skirt
  dance. She dances delightfully and AUSTIN cannot resist her charm.
  His face lightens, he smiles, and love comes into his eyes. JINNY
  sees and dances and sings all the better till she reaches him._

AUSTIN. [_Rising, he takes her into his arms._] You adorable Jinny!

JINNY. Ah, Jack! You're smiling again and--_you love me_!

  [_Clasping her arms about his neck._

AUSTIN. Yes! Is the theatre finished?

JINNY. No, only the first act. [_He sits in the big arm-chair, JINNY on
his knee._] I'm _tired_! [_He kisses her. There is a pause. There is a
knock on the door at Right._] Oh, hang it! [_Knock repeated._] _Don't_
answer it! We haven't half made up yet!

AUSTIN. But we must answer it, dear.

JINNY. [_As she rises unwillingly._] I don't see why--I should have let
her knock till she went away.

AUSTIN. Come in!

  [_MAGGIE enters with a letter._

JINNY. What is it, Maggie?

MAGGIE. A note from Miss Chester, m'm, and she's downstairs herself
waiting for an answer.

JINNY. For _me_?

  [_Taking the letter._

MAGGIE. No, m'm; I think she said it was for _Mr._ Austin.

JINNY. _Oh!_--You may wait outside for the answer, Maggie.

MAGGIE. Yes, m'm.

  [_She goes out._

JINNY. [_Slowly goes to AUSTIN and gives him the letter, lightly._] I
see now why you were so anxious to let Maggie in. Perhaps you were
expecting this.

AUSTIN. Jinny! [_Holding her by the hand and trying to pull her over to
him._] Come, I'll give you a kiss for the letter.

JINNY. No, thank you, I don't want kisses that are given by you for
letters from Ruth Chester. Yes! do kiss me! [_He kisses her._] I _won't_
be jealous! _I won't be!_ [_Clinching her teeth._] See, I'm not jealous
a bit! Read your old letter!

  [_AUSTIN opens the note and reads it. As he does so JINNY has passed
  on to the desk and sees AUSTIN'S unfinished letter to RUTH, which
  after a little hesitation she picks up and reads. AUSTIN, having read
  RUTH'S note, looks up thoughtfully a second, and then re-reads it.
  JINNY is furious over what she reads. As she finishes she gives a
  little cry from the very depths of her heart._

JINNY. Oh, _Jack_!

AUSTIN. What is it?

JINNY. Nothing!

  [_She sinks by the desk, crushing the letter in her hand. She looks
  over at him, and then down at the letter, and then back at him._

AUSTIN. Maggie!

JINNY. [_Rising suddenly. She speaks with a voice trembling with only
half-contained emotion and passion._] I told her to wait in the hall;
may I read it?

  [_Holding out her hand for the letter._

AUSTIN. Now look here, Jinny,--I always let you read everything, don't
I?

JINNY. [_Hiding his letter behind her back._] Yes. [_Holding out her
other hand._] Give it to me!

AUSTIN. Now begin to show that you really are going to turn over a new
leaf, and that your love is going to have perfect confidence, and don't
ask to see this letter.

JINNY. But I _do_ ask to see it!

AUSTIN. Then this time I must refuse you!

JINNY. What! is it even more compromising than _your_ letter to her?

AUSTIN. What letter? [_Looking first on the desk, he looks across at her
and sees it in her hand. He is angry, but also frightened for fear it
has told her her brother's secret._] And you've read it?

JINNY. It lay open on the desk there, and anyway the end justifies me!

AUSTIN. [_In an agony._] What does it tell you? I forget what I wrote!

JINNY. It tells me that my jealousy all along has been right, that I've
been a fool to let you blind me!

AUSTIN. [_With a great sigh of relief._] Is that all?

JINNY. [_Beside herself._] "Is that all!" Isn't that enough? Dear God,
isn't that enough? That there's an understanding between you and Ruth to
get rid of _me_!

AUSTIN. If it tells you that, the letter lies! Give it to me!

JINNY. No! _I'll_ read it to you! [_Reads with bitter emphasis._] "The
satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being
disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your
house to-night!" So--you and she went to Brooklyn, did you, and that's
why you came back too late to go to the theatre with me? You _cheat_!
[_She screams in her madness. A pause._] Why don't you answer--why don't
you say something?

AUSTIN. Because if I speak as I feel, I'm afraid of saying something
I'll regret all my life!

JINNY. You don't deny, then?

AUSTIN. Yes! that is due to Ruth. Whatever you may feel about _me_, you
have no _right_ to _insult_ her!

JINNY. Oh, _there's more to_ the letter!

AUSTIN. Jinny, don't you see what you're doing?

JINNY. Yes, I'm getting at the truth at last! [_Reads._] "My heart aches
for the blow you must have this evening! The man who loves you--"

AUSTIN. You shan't read any more; you're mad now!

  [_Tearing the letter away from her._

JINNY. I don't need the letter, the words are burning in here!
[_Pressing her hands to her forehead._] "The man who loves you isn't
bad, only weak. However, I feel once we can shake off the burden of
_this present marriage_"--oh! you--you _brute_ to say that!--"you will
never have cause to complain of him again! So far I have been able to
keep Jinny in perfect ignorance, but I feel the blow must fall upon her
now--"

  [_Interrupted._

AUSTIN. Shall I tell you _the truth_?

JINNY. You don't have to; I've found it out for myself!

AUSTIN. [_In weariness, in disgust, in utter hopelessness._] No! what's
the use. You've done it now--let it go! Let it all go--the whole thing!
What's the use!--it's finished!-- [_A knock on the door at Right._] Come
in!

  [_Maggie enters and closes the door behind her._

MAGGIE. Please, sir, Miss Chester came upstairs and made me knock again
to see if there was an answer and if you will see her now or not.

JINNY. [_Suddenly--aflame with her idea._] Yes! Maggie, show her in!

AUSTIN. No, no! What do you want to do! I'll see Miss Chester to-morrow,
Maggie.

  [_JINNY has crossed to the door, Right._

JINNY. Ruth! Ruth!

RUTH. [_Off stage._] Yes? May I come?

JINNY. _Do_ come in!

  [_She recrosses room; she and AUSTIN face each other for a second._

AUSTIN. [_In a lowered voice._] For God's sake, be careful!

  [_RUTH enters Right._

RUTH. Jinny!

  [_Going to her quickly to embrace her._

  [_JINNY, without speaking, draws away and stares at her with a look
  of hatred. RUTH, seeing it, stops short, and looks from JINNY to
  AUSTIN for explanation--she turns to AUSTIN and gives him her hand,
  which he takes, presses, and drops; JINNY'S shoulders contract at
  this moment; RUTH immediately turns again to JINNY._

RUTH. What is it, Jinny? [_To AUSTIN._] Surely she doesn't blame _me_ in
any way.

JINNY. _Blame you!_

AUSTIN. She doesn't _know_.

JINNY. That's a lie! I know everything, Ruth! I know why you followed my
husband to Rome, and why he sent for you to come back here. I know that
you and he were in Brooklyn this afternoon, and that you only plan to
get rid of me by some divorce, and by hook or crook to marry each other!

RUTH. No!--No!--

JINNY. Oh, you can lie, too, can you? I won't keep you waiting long!
You've stolen my husband from me--take him. I won't _share_ him with any
woman! He's yours now, and I'll soon be out of your way!

AUSTIN. _Jinny!_

RUTH. [_To Austin._] She must be told the truth.

  [_AUSTIN bows his head._

JINNY. Now you'll make up your story, will you? I tell you it's useless.
If he wouldn't let me see your compromising letter, I've seen a letter
from _him_ to _you_ to-night that gives the whole thing away.

RUTH. [_Very quietly._] Your husband went to Brooklyn _without me_, as
your _brother_ will tell you, to see the clergyman who married me, or
_thought_ he _married_ me to _Geoffrey Tillman_ three months ago!
[_JINNY looks up with a start._] That marriage was _illegal_ because
your brother was already married, and Mr. Austin tried and did get the
promise of silence this afternoon about the Brooklyn service, to prevent
a charge of bigamy against your brother. The first marriage, which still
holds good, was with--Maggie, your present servant--

  [_JINNY stands immovable. There is a silence._

AUSTIN. Geoffrey is not at your house?

RUTH. No, he left when I came on here. As I wrote you in the note I sent
upstairs, I was too stunned by what he told me to answer then, and I
wanted a word of advice with you. [_She turns to JINNY._] _I_ knew what
I thought was my _marriage_ to your brother must be kept secret, but I
could not learn why. This was my trouble, which, after your marriage, I
selfishly laid on your husband's shoulders, thinking he might help me!
[_No answer from JINNY, who stands as if struck dumb and into stone._]
Mr. Austin only learned the whole truth when we met that day in Rome.
_I_ did not learn till to-day that I was not honestly your brother's
wife. I had to be told, because divorce proceedings are to be started at
once to break--the other--marriage. [_No answer from JINNY._] To spare
me, and above all to spare you the knowledge of your brother's sin, your
husband has kept Geoffrey's secret from you. You have _well_ repaid him!
[_She turns again to AUSTIN._] Good-by--I feel to-night I couldn't marry
Geoffrey again. He's tumbled so far off his pedestal he has fallen out
of my heart. But still--we'll see; I've told him to come to-morrow.
_Thank you_ from the bottom of my heart--it's full of gratitude, even if
it is broken!

  [_She goes out Right._

  [_JINNY slowly turns, almost afraid to look at AUSTIN. He stands
  stern, with set face._

JINNY. [_In a low voice, ashamed to go near him._] Can you forgive me?
Can you--

AUSTIN. Ugh!

  [_Crossing room for his coat._

JINNY. I'm mad! You know I don't know what I do. But I _love you_--I
love you! Forgive me!

AUSTIN. Never!

  [_Taking up his coat._

JINNY. Where are you going?

AUSTIN. Out of this house.

JINNY. If you leave me, I'll not bear it! I'll kill myself! I warn you!

AUSTIN. Bah!--Good-by!

  [_Going to the door Right._

JINNY. No! Where are you going?

AUSTIN. Out of this house _for good_!

  [_At the door he turns and looks at her._

JINNY. [_Echoes._] For good?

AUSTIN. _For good!_

  [_He goes out, slamming the door behind him._

  [_JINNY stands a moment motionless. She then cries faintly--"Jack!"
  She goes to the door and pushes it open, crying out again in loud,
  strong despair, "Jack!" There is a moment's pause. She cries out
  again weakly, heartbrokenly, "Jack!"--comes back into the room, and
  throwing herself down on the floor, her head resting on her arms in
  the arm-chair, she sobs hysterically, wildly, "What have I done! Dear
  God, what have I done!" as_

    THE CURTAIN FALLS




ACT IV


Scene I

_Dawn of the next day. At the rise of the curtain JINNY is by the open
  window, whose curtains she has thrown aside. The sky is blood-red and
  streaked with gold the moment before sunrise. JINNY is worn and
  haggard, with hair dishevelled._

JINNY. [_Turning and leaning against the window._] Day at last! What a
night--what a night--but now it's morning and he hasn't come back! He
means it! And it's my own fault--it's my own fault! [_She shivers. She
closes the window and comes away. After a moment's pause she goes
deliberately and looks at the several gas fixtures in the room. She then
closes all the doors and locks them. She carefully draws down the shade
and closes in the curtains of the window. She hesitates, then pulls
aside the curtains and the shade, and takes a long, last look at the
dawn. She closes it all in again. She gets Austin's picture from the
desk and places it on the table near the centre of the room. She then
goes to the gas bracket at the Right and turns on the gas. She lights it
to see if the gas is all right; then blows it out. She then crosses to
the other bracket and turns that on; she goes to the chandelier at
centre, and, mounting a chair, turns on its three jets. She then sits
down by the table with AUSTIN'S picture before her, and looking into its
eyes, her elbows on the table, her head in her hands, she waits._] Oh,
Jack, my beloved! I couldn't help it--I never for one minute stopped
loving you better than everything else in my life, but no more than I
could stop loving you could I stop or help being jealous! Once the cruel
idea has got hold of me it seems to _have_ to work its way out!
Everything gets red before me and I don't seem to know what I say or do!
It's no excuse, I know. I've got no excuse, only I _love_ you! You'll
forgive me when I'm gone, won't you, Jack? You'll know I _loved_
you!--loved you so I couldn't _live_ without you!--loved you!--_loved_
you! [_She kisses the photograph tenderly, adoringly, slowly, in
tears._] Loved--you--loved you!--loved--

  [_Her head drops forward, as_

    THE CURTAIN FALLS


SCENE II

_The same morning, three hours later. The curtain rises on the same
  scene in a dull, cold, early morning light. The lamp has burnt itself
  out. A tiny ray of sunlight steals through a slip between the
  curtains. JINNY sits by the table, her arms spread over it and her
  head on her arms--she is perfectly still. AUSTIN'S picture is before
  her. There is a moment's silence. Voices are heard outside,
  approaching door, at Right. Gradually what they say is distinguished._

MAGGIE. No, sir. She hasn't been to bed; I've been to her bedroom--that
door's not unlocked.

TILLMAN. She's been here all night?

MAGGIE. Yes, sir. But twice in the night, sir, I came to the door and
spoke to her and she wouldn't answer me--but I could hear her walking up
and down and sometimes talking to herself.

TILLMAN. [_Calls softly._] Jinny! [_Knocks softly._] It's father! [_No
answer._] It looks as if she were asleep now.

AUSTIN. [_At a little distance._] Father!

TILLMAN. I'm outside the library door.

AUSTIN. [_Nearer._] I can't wait--have you seen her? Will she see me?

TILLMAN. She's locked herself in here. She's not been to her own room.

AUSTIN. Not been to bed at all! Poor Jinny--God forgive me.

TILLMAN. Maggie says she's walked the floor all night.

  [_He knocks on the door Right._

AUSTIN. [_Outside the door, Right, rather softly._] Jinny! I'm so sorry!
I can't say how sorry! I've thought it out through the night, and I
think I understand things better. [_He waits a moment for an answer._]
Jinny, answer me! you shall be as jealous as you like, and I'll always
explain and kiss away those doubts of yours, and I'll have no more
secrets from you, dear. Not one! Jinny! [_As he calls there is a slight
movement of one of JINNY'S arms. With a note of alarm._] Father! I can't
hear a sound of breathing! [_A moment's pause as they listen._] She
threatened it--she threatened it several times! [_With great
determination._] We must get into this room--do you hear me--we must get
in if we have to break the door down! [_They shake the door. He calls a
little louder._] Jinny, Jinny darling--do you hear me? [_JINNY makes a
sort of feeble effort to lift her head, but fails._] Jinny, for God's
sake, answer me! I love you Jinny--_Jinny!_ [_Very slowly JINNY lifts
her head and, with difficulty, she hears as if in a dream; she is dazed,
barely alive._] She doesn't answer!

TILLMAN. See if the key is in the lock.

AUSTIN. No.

TILLMAN. Get the other keys, Maggie.

AUSTIN. _Father!_ Gas! Don't you smell it?

TILLMAN. What!

AUSTIN. Gas, I tell you! O God! she's killed herself! Jinny! Jinny!

  [_Beating the door._

  [_JINNY staggers up, she tries to call "Jack"--but the word only comes
  out in a half-articulate whisper! She tries again, but fails._

MAGGIE. Here's a key, sir.

  [_JINNY tries to go to the door; she staggers a few steps and then
  falls._

  [_They try one key--it does not unlock the door; they try another._

  [_JINNY half raises herself and makes an effort to crawl, but is
  unable and sinks back upon the floor._

AUSTIN. Break the door in, father! We daren't waste any more time!

TILLMAN. No, this has done it!

  [_They open the door and rush in. They stop aghast at JINNY and the
  oppressiveness of the gas in the room._

TILLMAN. Jinny!

AUSTIN. Quick--the window! [_TILLMAN tears aside the curtains and throws
open the window. The sunshine of full morning pours in. He then rushes
to the opposite gas burners and turns them off. Kneeling quickly beside
her._] _Jinny! My wife!_ My beloved!

  [_He takes her up in his arms and hurries to the window._

TILLMAN. Are we too late?

AUSTIN. I don't know. No! she's breathing--and see--see!--she knows
me!--she knows me! [_JINNY smiles at him pathetically._] Send Maggie for
the doctor!

  [_TILLMAN goes out Right._

AUSTIN. Jinny, forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! [_She slips her two
arms up and joins them about his neck. AUSTIN kisses her._] Father!
We've saved her! Oh, thank God, we've saved her!

  [_Bringing her to big chair and putting her in it, he kneels at her
  feet._

JINNY. [_Whispers faintly._] _Dear Jack!_ You forgive _me_--all my
beastly jealousy?

AUSTIN. There's one thing stronger even than jealousy, my Jinny. And
that's LOVE! That's _LOVE_!

  [_He kisses her hands, and_

The Climbers

  A keen satire on contemporary New York society, which explains its

  "And I after happiness and all it brings."--_Act II_.

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
