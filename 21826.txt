Rhymes to Remember...


        "_Always have lobster sauce with salmon,
        And put mint sauce your roasted lamb on.
    In dressing salad mind this law
    With two hard yolks use one raw.
        Roast pork, sans apple sauce, past doubt
        Is Hamlet with the Prince left out.
    Broil lightly your beefsteak--to fry it
    Argues contempt of christian diet.
        It gives true epicures the vapors
        To see boiled mutton minus capers.
    Boiled turkey, gourmands know, of course
    Is exquisite with celery sauce.
        Roasted in paste, a haunch of mutton
        Might make ascetics play the glutton.
    To roast spring chickens is to spoil them,
    Just split them down the back and broil them,
    Shad, stuffed and baked is most delicious,
    T'would have electrified Apicius.
        Roast veal with rich stock gravy serve,
        And pickled mushrooms too, observe,
    The cook deserves a hearty cuffing
    Who serves roast fowl with tasteless stuffing.
        But one might rhyme for weeks this way,
        And still have lots of things to say;
    And so I'll close, for reader mine,
    This is about the hour to dine._"




SOUP.


"The best soups are made with a blending of many flavors. Don't be
afraid of experimenting with them. Where you make one mistake you will
be surprised to find the number of successful varieties you can produce.
If you like a spicy flavor try two or three cloves, or allspice, or bay
leaves. All soups are improved by a dash of onion, unless it is the
white soups, or purees from chicken, veal, fish, etc. In these celery
may be used. In nothing as well as soups can a housekeeper be economical
of the odds and ends of food left from meals. One of the best cooks was
in the habit of saving everything, and announced one day, when her soup
was especially praised, that it contained the crumbs of gingerbread from
her cake box! Creamed onions left from a dinner, or a little stewed
corn, potatoes mashed, a few baked beans--even a small dish of apple
sauce have often added to the flavor of soup. Of course, all good meat
gravies, or bones from roast or boiled meats, can be added to your stock
pot. A little butter is always needed in tomato soup. In making stock,
use a quart of water for every pound of meat and bone. Cut the meat in
pieces, crack the bones, place all in the kettle, pour over it the
proper quantity of cold water; let it soak a while on the back of the
range before cooking. Let soup boil slowly, never hard, (an hour for
each pound of meat) strain through a sieve or coarse cloth. Never let
the fat remain on your soup. Let get cold and lift it off, or skim it
off hot."


BROWN STOCK.

MRS. W. COOK.

Four pounds shin of beef, or other meats and bones--four carrots, four
onions, one turnip, one small head of celery, one half tablespoonful of
salt, one half teaspoonful of peppercorns, six cloves, five pints of
cold water. Cut up the meat bone and place it in a large saucepan, pour
over the water, skim when boiling, prepare the vegetables, add them to
the saucepan; cover closely and boil slowly four hours. The spice should
be added with the vegetables.


CREAM OF CELERY SOUP.

MRS. ERNEST F. WURTELE.

One quart chicken or veal broth; one quart milk; one half cupful rice;
one teaspoonful salt; one head celery; seasoning. Use for this soup a
quart of chicken or veal broth and about a quart of milk; pick over and
wash the rice, rinse it well in cold water, and put it in a thick
saucepan over the fire with a pint of milk and a teaspoonful of salt;
wash a head of celery and grate the white stalks, letting the grated
celery fall into milk enough to cover it; put the grated celery with the
rice and gently simmer them together until the rice is tender enough to
rub through a sieve with a potato masher, adding more milk if the rice
absorbs what has first been put with it. After the rice has been rubbed
through the sieve, return it to the saucepan, place it again over the
fire, and gradually stir with it the quart of stock or broth; if this
quantity of stock does not dilute the soup to a creamy consistency, add
a little milk; let the soup get scalding hot, season it with salt, white
pepper, and a very little grated nutmeg, and serve at once.


CELERY SOUP.

MRS. STOCKING.

Four large potatoes, three large onions, six or eight stalks of celery.
Chop all the vegetables very fine, and place in an earthern kettle and
cover with boiling water, stir often till cooked, then add one quart of
milk and let boil; add butter, pepper and salt to taste. This receipt
will serve six persons.


CHICKEN CREAM SOUP.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.

Take the carcase of a roast chicken or turkey, break the bones, and
cover with a quart of cold water and simmer for two hours adding
boiling water, to keep the original quantity. Strain and return to
kettle, add one chopped onion, two grated raw potatoes, one half small
turnip grated, and one half cup rice. Boil until rice is very soft.
Strain again, and return to kettle and let boil, and add one pint milk,
one teaspoon cornstarch rubbed smooth in a tablespoon butter and a
little salt and pepper, serve hot.


CONSOMME A LA TOLEDO--CLEAR SOUP.

MISS STEVENSON.

One quart stock, two eggs, two gherkins, a little red and green
colouring, two tablespoonfuls cream, whites and shells of two eggs, one
wine glass of sherry, and a little nutmeg. Beat the two whole eggs, pour
over them the cream (hot.) Season the custard with pepper, salt and
nutmeg, colour half red and half green, pour both parts into buttered
tins, poach in hot water until firm. Beat the whites and shells of eggs
with a little cold water, add them to the stock, pour it into a saucepan
and whisk over the fire till boiling; draw on one side and simmer ten
minutes. Cut the custard in shapes, rinse then in warm water, shred the
gherkins, strain the soup, add the wine and garnishing just before
serving.


CAULIFLOWER SOUP.

One cauliflower, two yolks of egg, one half pint of cream, one quart
chicken stock. Boil together the stock and cauliflower, for twenty
minutes, take out the cauliflower, put aside some of the best parts,
pass remainder through a sieve, mix together the yolks and cream, add
them to the soup, put all in a saucepan and stir over the fire until it
begins to thicken, put the pieces of cauliflower into a tureen and pour
the soup over them; the stock used in this soup is better without any
other vegetables.


FISH SOUP.

Two pounds of raw fish, one tablespoonful parsley, one and one half
ounces butter, one ounce flour of rice, one half pint milk, one quart of
water, pepper, and salt. Boil together the bones and skin of fish for
half an hour. Strain, melt butter in a saucepan, stir into it the flour,
add strained water from the pan. Cut up the fish into small pieces, add
it, also salt and pepper, boil slowly ten minutes, add parsley at last
minute.


GIBLET SOUP.

MISS BEEMER.

Giblets from two or three fowls; two quarts of water; one of stock; two
tablespoons of butter, ditto of flour; salt, pepper, and onion if
desired. Put giblets on to boil in the water and boil gently till
reduced to one quart (about two hours); take out the giblets, cut off
tough parts and chop fine the remainder. Return to the liquor and add
stock. Cook butter and flour together until a rich brown, and add to
the soup; season, cook gently half an hour; stir in half a cup of bread
crumbs and in a few minutes serve hot.


KIDNEY SOUP.

MISS STEVENSON.

One ox kidney, one quart second stock or water, one tablespoon Hardy
sauce, one tablespoon mushroom ketchup, one ounce butter, one ounce rice
flour, pepper, salt and cayenne. Wash and dry the kidney, cut into thin
slices; mix together the flour, pepper and salt and roll the kidney in
it. Brown them quickly in the butter, pour over the stock, skim when
boiling. Add sauce and simmer slowly two hours.


LENTIL SOUP.

MRS. THEOPHILUS OLIVER.

One half pound of lentils, one carrot, one onion, one ounce dripping,
salt, pepper corns, one quart of water, one tablespoon of flour. Soak
the lentils all night, wash well, scrape carrot, and onion cut up. Put
the dripping into a saucepan, when warm, put in vegetables, lentils and
flour. Stir for five minutes until all fat is absorbed, add the water
warm, some herbs tied in a bit of muslin. Boil for an hour or more. Rub
through a sieve, return to saucepan. Reheat and serve.


OX TAIL SOUP.

MRS. W. COOK.

Divide an ox tail into lengths of an inch and a half; melt an ounce of
butter in a stew pan and fry the pieces in this, turning them about for
five minutes. Add two quarts of stock or water and bring gently to a
boil. Throw in a teaspoonful of salt, and carefully remove the scum as
it rises. Add a carrot, a turnip and an onion with two cloves stuck in
it, a little celery, a blade of mace and a small bouquet of garum. Stew
gently two and one half hours. Strain the soup and put the pieces of ox
tail in cold water to free them of fat. Mix an ounce and one half of
flour smoothly with a little cold water, add to the stock and simmer for
twenty minutes. Add a little cayenne, a few drops of lemon juice and a
glass of port wine if liked and serve.


OYSTER SOUP.

MISS MIRIAM STRANG.

One quart boiling water, one quart milk, stir in one teacup rolled
cracker crumbs, season with pepper and salt to taste. When all come to a
boil add one quart of oysters; stir well so as to keep from scorching,
then add a piece of butter size of an egg; let it boil up just once,
then remove from the fire immediately.


CREAM OF PEA SOUP.

MISS RUTH SCOTT.

One tin of peas and one pint of water, a very small piece of onion, let
it boil about twenty minutes, strain and mash through sieve. Two
tablespoonfuls of butter, and one of flour, well blended together. Add
that to the peas. Last of all add a pint or _more of boiling milk_. Put
on the stove till it thickens, but be careful not to let it boil.


PALESTINE SOUP.

MRS. W. COOK.

Wash and pare two pounds of artichokes and put them in a stewpan with a
slice of butter, two or three strips of bacon rind, which have been
scalded and scraped and two bay leaves. Put the lid on the stew pan and
let the vegetables "sweat" over the fire for eight or ten minutes,
shaking the pan occasionally to keep them from sticking. Pour on water
to cover the artichokes and stew gently till soft. Rub them through a
sieve, mix the liquor they were boiled in with them, make the soup hot
and add boiling milk until it is as thick as double cream. Add pepper
and salt to taste. Just before serving, mix with the soup a quarter of a
pint of hot cream. This addition will be a valuable one, but may be
dispensed with.


PUREE DE PETIT POIS.

MISS STEVENSON.

One pint green peas, two yolks of egg, one gill cream, one and one half
pints stock, salt and pepper. Strain the liquid from the peas, put them
with the stock in a saucepan and simmer twenty minutes; pass them
through a sieve, pour back to the pan, add yolks, cream, pepper and
salt, and stir over the fire until it begins to thicken; do not allow it
to boil. A spray of mint boiled with the peas is a great improvement.


PUREE DE VEAU.

Four ounces pounded veal, one pint stock, one ounce butter, one ounce
flour, yolks of two eggs, few drops of lemon juice, one half pint
whipped cream. Mix veal and butter together in a saucepan, add flour,
then by degrees the stock (hot) just boil up. Mix yolks and add little
by little the cream, a few drops of cochineal, salt and pepper, pour
over this the contents of the saucepan very carefully.


TOMATO SOUP.

MRS. HENRY THOMSON.

One pint of stewed tomatoes, add a pinch of soda, stir till it ceases
foaming, then add one pint boiling water and one pint of milk, strain
and put on the stove and when near boiling, add a tablespoonful of
cornstarch, wet it with a little cold milk, one tablespoon butter, a
little pepper and salt to taste.


TOMATO SOUP.

MISS EDITH HENRY.

Take a tin of tomatoes and add half a pint of water. Let this boil for
half an hour till the tomatoes are well broken. Add a tablespoonful of
cornstarch, dissolved in a little cold water and mix well. Flavor with
salt and pepper to taste, and half a small onion. Then add a quart of
milk. Let this boil and stir well, so that it will mix, and be careful
that it does not burn on the bottom of the pan.


TURKISH SOUP.

MRS. W. COOK.

One quart of white stock, one half teacupful of rice, yolks of two eggs,
one tablespoon cream, salt and pepper. In preparing this soup boil first
the rice in the stock for twenty minutes. Then pass the whole through a
wire sieve, rubbing through such of the rice as may stick with a spoon,
then stir it thoroughly to beat out such lumps as the rice may have
formed and return all to the saucepan. The yolk of egg, cream, pepper
and salt, must now be well beaten together and added to the stock and
rice, the whole stirred over the fire for two minutes, care being taken
to prevent boiling after the eggs are put in, or they will curdle. This
soup should be served very hot and is excellent.


TURTLE BEAN SOUP.

MISS FRASER.

One pint of black beans, boil in two quarts of water, one onion, two
carrots, small teaspoon of allspice, five or six cloves, a small bit of
bacon or ham. A good bone of roast beef or mutton, let all boil till
quite tender perhaps two hours. Then turn into a colander, take out the
bone and rub all the rest with a wooden spoon through the colander, if
this is too thick add some stock or water. Some meat balls can be
added.




FISH AND OYSTERS.


    "Now good digestion wait on appetite,
     And health on both."--MACBETH.


RULE FOR SELECTING FISH.

If the gills are red, the eyes full, and the whole fish firm and stiff,
they are fresh and good; if on the contrary, the gills are pale, the
eyes sunken, the flesh flabby, they are stale.


BAKED CODFISH.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

Choose a good sized fresh codfish, prepare it for cooking without
beheading it, fill the inside with a dressing of bread crumbs, a finely
chopped onion, a little chopped suet, pepper and salt and moisten all
with an egg. Sew up the fish and bake, basting with butter or dripping.
If butter, beware of too much salt.


BAKED CODFISH.

MRS. R. M. STOCKING.

Pick very fine one cup of codfish; soak several hours in cold water;
have ready two cups of mashed potatoes and mix well with one egg, a cup
of milk, one half cup of butter, little salt and pepper; put this in a
baking dish and cover the top with bread crumbs; moisten with milk; bake
one-half hour.


CURRIED FISH.

MRS. W. COOK.

One pound cooked white fish, one apple, two ounces of butter, one onion,
one pint of fish stock, one tablespoon curry-powder, one tablespoon
flour, one teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar, salt and pepper, six ounces
of rice. Slice the apple and onion, and brown them in a pan with a
little butter, stir in them the flour and curry powder, add the stock by
degrees; skim when boiling and simmer slowly one half hour, stir in them
the lemon juice, also a very small teaspoon sugar; strain and return to
the saucepan, cut up the fish into neat pieces, and put them into the
saucepan also, when quite hot dish with a border of rice.


FISH CREAM.

MRS. J. G. SCOTT.

One can of salmon, one quart of milk, one cup of flour, one cup of
butter, three eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs, one half cupful grated
cheese, one onion, one bunch of parsley, two bay leaves. Take the canned
salmon, or boil a fish, and when cool take out the bones and break the
fish in small pieces. Put on to boil one quart of milk, an onion, a
bunch of parsley, and two bay leaves; after boiling strain through a
colander, then add a cup of flour mixed smooth with cold milk and a cup
of butter; beat up three eggs and pour into the mixture. Put in a baking
dish alternate layers of fish and cream until the dish is full, putting
cream top and bottom. Place on top one cup of bread crumbs and one half
cup of grated cheese. Salt to taste, and cayenne pepper. Bake twenty
minutes.


FISH MOULD.

MRS. A. COOK.

Boil a fresh haddock, remove the bones and pick it in pieces, soak some
bread in milk; put the fish, bread, a small piece of butter, one or two
eggs, pepper and salt together in a bowl and beat them well together.
Put the mixture in a mould and steam, turn out, and garnish with
parsley. Tomato sauce is nice poured round the mould when turned out.
The fish should be about twice the quantity of the bread.


TOMATO SAUCE.

Six tomatoes, two ounces butter, one half ounce flour, one half pint
stock, one teaspoon of salt, one fourth teaspoon of pepper. Place the
tomatoes in a pan and pour over them the stock, add salt and pepper.
Place the pan over the fire and cook all slowly for half an hour. Place
a wire sieve over a basin and rub the tomatoes and stock through the
sieve. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour stir well together,
pour over the tomatoes and stock and stir all over the fire till
boiling, when the sauce is ready for use. Tinned tomatoes do not take so
long to boil.


FISH SCALLOP.

MISS RUTH SCOTT.

Remains of cold fish of any sort, one half pint of cream, one half
tablespoonful anchovy sauce, one half teaspoonful made mustard, one half
teaspoonful walnut ketchup, pepper and salt, bread crumbs. Put all the
ingredients into a stew pan, carefully picking the fish from the bones;
set it on the fire, let it remain till nearly hot, and stir
occasionally. Then put in a deep dish, with bread and small bits of
butter on top; put in the oven till nearly browned. Serve hot.


FISH PIE.

MRS. ANDREW THOMSON.

Boil one haddock, take the best part of the fish, one pint of milk and a
piece of butter as large as an egg, half a cup of flour, two yolks of
eggs, stir together, and then mix well with the fish. Put in a pudding
dish, and take a half cup of bread crumbs, half a cup of grated cheese,
put in the oven for ten minutes, salt and pepper to taste.


POTTED HERRINGS.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

Scale and clean fresh herrings, then taking the fish by the tail you can
easily remove the backbone drawing it towards the head. The smaller
bones will melt in the vinegar; remove the heads and roll each fish up,
tail end inside, and wind a thread round each roll, lay them in the
vessel they are to remain in till used, a stone earthernware crock is
best. Make scalding hot with spices as much vinegar as will cover them,
pour it over the fish and keep them hot about the stove for about an
hour, when they will be well cooked through; do not let them boil or
they will break. Keep in a cool place. Spices: whole white pepper, whole
allspice, and a blade of mace if it is liked.


LOBSTER CUTLETS.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

Mince the lobster fine, and season with pepper and salt, make good and
thick with drawn butter. Mix with the lobster enough to make it stick
together. Shape with the hands into cutlets, roll in bread crumbs and
fry in hot lard.

_The Sauce:_--Make rather a thin custard, season with pepper, salt and a
little nutmeg and chopped parsley, place over the cutlets.


LOBSTER STEW.

MRS. ERNEST F. WURTELE.

Take a boiled lobster and split it open, cut the meat into small pieces
and put into a saucepan with one pint of milk; when boiling add two
tablespoons of flour dissolved in a little water, and boil ten minutes.
Season with salt, pepper and a small piece of butter. Just before
serving pour in a wineglassful of sherry. Canned lobster may be used
with very good results.


OYSTER PIE.--FAMOUS.

One cup melted butter is put in a lined saucepan, and three tablespoons
of flour which are rubbed well into the butter, one half teaspoon of
mace, a little pepper and salt. The juice of the oysters is put into
this to make it thin, and little by little one quart of boiling milk to
one quart of oysters. Last the oysters are put in very carefully and
given a very short boil. The whole is pretty thick and is then put into
a pie dish with pie crust over; one cup of cream is put in just before
the oysters are emptied into the pie dish.

MEATS.


MEATS.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

To make beefsteak tender, rub a pinch of baking soda on each side of the
steak about an hour before cooking and roll it up on itself in the
meantime. A very small pinch of brown sugar used in the same way is
good, but the soda is thought preferable.


MEAT BALLS.

MRS. WADDLE.

Mash finely some potatoes, pass through a sieve, stir in the yolks of
two eggs, one ounce of butter, pepper and salt. Mince finely some beef
or tongue. Mix all well together, add a little parsley, roll into balls,
cover with egg and bread crumbs, fry in hot lard. Let them dry before
the fire on paper. Very good.


SPICED BEEF.

Rub well into a round weighing forty pounds, three ounces saltpetre, let
stand six or eight hours, pound three ounces allspice, one pound black
pepper, two pounds salt, and seven ounces brown sugar; rub the beef well
with the salt and spices. Let it remain fourteen days turning it every
day and rub with the pickle, then wash off the spices and put in a deep
pan, cut small six pounds of suet, put some in the bottom of the pan,
the greater part on the top, cover with coarse paste and bake eight
hours; when cold take off the paste pour off the gravy, it will keep six
months.


SPICED BEEF.

MISS J. E. FRASER.

Two pounds of raw steak from the round, free from bone, fat or sinew,
chopped very fine, six soda biscuits rolled fine, one cup of milk, two
eggs beaten in one tablespoon salt, one dessertspoon of pepper, and add
a little spice if you like. Butter an earthenware jar as large round the
top as the bottom and press the mixture in very lightly. Cover with
butter one half inch thick. Cover the jar with a plate and bake in an
oven for two hours. Serve whole or cut in slices. Nicer cold.


BEEF A LA MODE.

MRS. I. T. SMYTHE.

One half pound of meat, cut up into four inch squares and two or three
inches thick, add onion chopped fine, one teaspoon salt, and one half
teaspoon pepper, cover with boiling water and place in jar and cook in
oven for two hours.


BEEF OLIVES.

MRS. GEORGE M. CRAIG.

Thin slices of steak cut into squares about the size of hand; make a
dressing similar to chicken, bake, then put on the steak and roll, put
in the saucepan with some onion and butter in a little water, let it
simmer for an hour and a half to two hours.


COLD MEAT CUTLETS.

MRS. A. COOK.

Half pound cold meat or chicken, one ounce butter, one ounce of flour,
one gill white stock, one teaspoon chopped parsley, one half saltspoon
grated nutmeg, small teaspoon of salt, saltspoon of pepper, grated rind
of half a small lemon. Pass chicken twice through the mincer, then melt
the butter, stir into it the flour, get it perfectly smooth and add
stock, don't let it brown, stir until it boils and boil two minutes, add
the chicken, (when properly cooked will leave the pan clearly) add
pepper, salt, nutmeg, parsley and lemon, put it away to cool. In using
cold beef, a teaspoon anchovy essence or paste is an improvement, and to
mutton a teaspoon mushroom catsup. When the mixture is cold, place some
flour on board to prevent sticking and form into rolls with square
edges, beat the egg, place breadcrumbs mixed with pepper and salt on
paper, put the rolls first in the egg, then in crumbs, have sufficient
fat in pan and when the white smoke rises, put the rolls in and fry
three minutes, drain on paper. Brown sauce may be served and mashed peas
or potatoes placed in the centre.


CURED MUTTON HAMS.

MRS. W. COOK.

Quarter of a pound bay salt, ditto of common salt, one ounce saltpetre,
four ounces brown sugar, one ounce allspice, four ounces black pepper
(whole), the allspice or one ounce of coriander seed must be bruised not
ground, one quart of water: boil all together a few minutes and rub on
hot. In three weeks the hams will be ready to hang if well rubbed with
the pickle everyday. Sufficient pickle for two.


BRAISED MUTTON.

MRS. ARCHIE COOK.

One boned shoulder of mutton, four ounces of bread crumbs, two ounces of
suet, rind of half a lemon, bunch of mixed vegetables, one tablespoon
chopped parsley, other herbs if liked, one egg, a little milk, one
teaspoon of salt, half teaspoon of pepper. Chop suet finely (or fat from
mutton will do) add breadcrumbs, parsley, grated lemon rind and salt,
moisten with egg and milk. Place mixture in mutton, roll up and tie
securely. Slice vegetables and put them with bones in saucepan also two
cloves, a bay leaf and peppercorns, pour over them a pint of stock or
water, place mutton on top and boil slowly about one and one half hours
according to size of meat, then brush it over with glaze or sprinkle
with flour, pepper and salt and bake it half an hour. Place on a dish,
pour fat from pan and stir in half ounce of flour (browned) add stock in
which meat was cooked, also one tablespoon mushroom catsup and one
tablespoon Worcester sauce, pepper and salt, boil two minutes and strain
around meat. Vegetables in stock can be cut to ornament the dish.


GENUINE IRISH STEW.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.

Take the feet and legs of a pig, cut off at the hams, two will be
sufficient for a family of eight. Singe off the hair and thoroughly
cleanse them, removing the toes by scorching. Cut the legs in pieces
suitable for stewing, put down in cold water and cook slowly for three
hours. Pare and cut up nine or ten good sized potatoes and add to your
stew with salt and pepper, about one half an hour before dishing. After
the potatoes have been put in, the greatest care must be taken to
prevent them from sticking to the pot and burning, therefore you must
stir frequently with a spoon. What remains from dinner pour into a mould
and it will become a jelly, which is nice eaten cold for breakfast.


TO STEW A FRESH TONGUE.

MRS. ARCHIE COOK.

Wash it very well and rub it well with common salt and a little
saltpetre; let it lie two or three days; then boil till the skin will
peel off; put it into a saucepan with part of the liquor it has boiled
in and a pint of good stock, season with black and Jamaica pepper, two
or three pounded cloves. Add a glassful of white wine, a tablespoonful
of mushroom catsup and one of lemon pickle, thicken with butter rolled
in flour. Stew the tongue till quite soft in this sauce; the wine can be
added when dished or left out if preferred.


LAMBS' TONGUES STEWED.

MRS. ARCHIE COOK.

Six tongues, three heaping tablespoons of butter, one large onion, two
slices of carrot, three slices of white turnip, three tablespoons flour,
one of salt, a little pepper, one quart of stock or water and some sweet
herbs. Boil the tongues one hour and a half in clear water, take them
up, cover with cold water, and draw off the skins. Put the butter,
onion, turnip and carrot in the stewpan and cook slowly for fifteen
minutes, then add the flour and cook until brown, stirring all the time.
Stir the stock into this and when it boils up, add the tongues, salt,
pepper and herbs; simmer gently for two hours. Cut the carrots, turnips
and potatoes into cubes. Boil the potatoes in salted water ten minutes
and the carrots and turnips one hour. Place the tongues in the centre of
a hot dish, arrange the vegetables around them, strain the gravy, over
all. Garnish with parsley.


ROAST FILLET OF VEAL.

MRS. RATTRAY.

Take a good sized, white, fat leg of veal, weighing some ten or twelve
pounds. Remove the meat carefully from the bone and take out the bone.
Then pin the meat securely into a nice round with skewers; fill the
cavity from which the bone was taken with the following dressing. Roast
in a slow oven, allowing one quarter of an hour for each pound, and be
sure to keep it thoroughly basted with plenty of beef dripping.


DRESSING.

Make ready one coffee cup of bread crumbs, one teaspoonful of chopped
parsley, one half teaspoonful summer savory, pepper and salt to taste.
Take a good sized onion, peel, slice, and fry it well with a piece of
butter the size of an egg; pour the liquor from this into your bread
crumbs and blend all thoroughly together. Be careful not to put the
onion in, only the fried butter and onion juice. When the meat is
cooked, remove from pan and make a rich brown gravy to serve with it.
Garnish your dish with fried bacon and slices of lemon.


STUFFING FOR VEAL.

MRS. W. CLINT.

Chop half a pound of beef suet very fine, put in a basin, with eight
ounces of bread crumbs, four ounces of chopped parsley, a tablespoonful
of equal quantities of powdered thyme and marjoram, the rind of a lemon
grated, the juice of half a one; season with pepper and salt, and a
quarter of a nutmeg; mix the whole with two eggs; this will do also for
turkey or baked fish.


YORKSHIRE PUDDING.

MRS. GEORGE CRESSMAN.

Two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of flour, a little salt and milk to make a
batter the thickness of cream. When the beef is roasted pour off the
boiling dripping into another pan, turn in the batter and bake to a good
brown.




GAME.


ACCOMPANIMENTS.--With wild ducks, cucumber sauce, currant jelly or
cranberry sauce.


ROAST DUCK WITH APPLES.

MISS BEEMER.

Pluck and singe a duck, draw it without breaking the intestines, wipe it
with a wet towel and lay it in a baking pan; wipe a dozen small sour
apples with a wet cloth, cut out the cores without breaking the apples,
and arrange them around the duck; put the pan into a hot oven and
quickly brown the duck, then moderate the heat of the oven and continue
the cooking for about twenty minutes, or until the apples are tender but
not broken, baste both duck and apples every five minutes until they are
done, and then serve them on the same dish. It is a great improvement
some think, to parboil the duck for fifteen minutes with an onion in the
water, and the strong fishy flavor that is sometimes so disagreeable in
wild ducks will have disappeared. A carrot will answer the same purpose.


ROAST QUAIL WITH BREAD SAUCE.

Peel and slice an onion and put it over the fire in a pint of milk;
pluck and singe half a dozen quail, draw them without breaking the
intestines, cut off the heads and feet, and wipe them with a wet towel;
rub them all over with butter; season them with pepper and salt, and
roast them before a very hot fire for fifteen minutes basting them three
or four times with butter. Have some slices of toast laid under them to
catch the drippings. While the birds are roasting make a bread sauce as
follows; roll a pint bowlfull of dry bread, and sift the crumbs; use the
finest ones for the sauce, and the largest for the frying later; remove
the onion from the milk in which it has been boiling, stir into the milk
the finest portion of the crumbs, season it with a saltspoonful of white
pepper and a grate of nutmeg, stir in a tablespoonful of butter, and
stir the sauce until it is smooth; then place the saucepan containing it
in a pan of boiling water to keep it hot; put two tablespoonfuls of
butter over the fire in a frying pan, and when it is smoking hot put
into it the coarse half of the crumbs, dust them with cayenne pepper,
and stir them until they are light brown; then at once put them on a hot
dish; put the bread sauce into a gravy-boat ready to send it to the
table. Arrange to have the fried breadcrumbs, sauce and quail done at
the same time; serve the birds on the toast which has been laid under
them; in serving the quail, lay each bird on a hot plate, pour over it a
large spoonful of the bread sauce and on that place a spoonful of the
fried bread crumbs.


VENISON STEAK.

MRS. ERNEST F. WURTELE.

Take a piece of frozen venison, and put into water in which has been put
two tablespoons of vinegar. Just leave until the ice comes to the
surface of the meat, take the meat out and remove the ice with a knife;
wipe dry and flour well, put a good piece of butter in the pan; let
brown, put the steak in salt, and pepper, fry on both sides, then add a
cup of rich milk, push the pan to the back of the stove and cover it and
let it stew slowly for one and a half hours--If the steak is very dry
lard it with salt pork before frying.


STEWED PIGEONS.

MRS. HARRY LAURIE.

For two pair of pigeons stuff first with bread, summer savory, butter,
pepper, salt. Put eight or nine slices of fat pork, in an iron pot to
fry, until the pork is well browned, then take it out and put in the
pigeons and let brown thoroughly, keep turning to prevent burning. Then
add one pint of stock, season if required, put back slices of pork and
let stew for an hour and a half (at least) quietly. If gravy is not
thick enough, add a tablespoon of brown flour. About quarter of an hour
before done, put in a can of green peas--Then serve.


STEWED HARE.

Can be prepared in the same manner as the above for stewed pigeons, with
the addition of spices: cloves a few, and a little more of cinnamon.


BREAD SAUCE.

MRS. BENSON BENNETT.

One half pint boiled milk to one cup of fine bread crumbs, one small
onion, two cloves, one piece of mace, salt to taste, let simmer five
minutes, add small piece of butter.


CRANBERRY JELLY.

Pare, quarter, and core twelve good sized tart apples, place in a
porcelain kettle with two quarts of cranberries, cover well with cold
water and stew until soft, then strain through a jelly bag, add to this
juice two pounds of confectioner's sugar, and boil as you would any
other jelly, until it falls from the skimmer; when you dip it in skim
off any froth that arises while boiling, put in moulds and let it get
firm before using.


PLAIN DRESSING FOR FOWLS.

MRS. W. CLINT.

One cup and a half of bread crumbs (not too stale), one heaped teaspoon
each of parsley, thyme and savory, one dessert spoonful butter, half
teaspoon salt, quarter of a teaspoon pepper, mix all together with a
little milk.


PLAIN DRESSING FOR GEESE AND DUCKS.

One cup breadcrumbs or potatoes, one cup or more of stewed onions, one
tablespoon sage, pepper, salt and a little butter, mix with a little
milk.




VEGETABLES.


    "Cheerful cooks make every dish a feast."--MASSINGER.


Always have the water boiling when you put your vegetables in, and keep
it constantly boiling until they are done. Cook each kind by itself when
convenient. All vegetables should be well seasoned.


APPLES.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

When the barrel of apples you have bought, begins to make your mind
uneasy, because they can spoil faster than you can use them, a good plan
is to peel, core and stir them with a very little sugar and screw them
down in your jam jars. They will keep for a couple of months and will be
handy to fill a tart or as apple sauce, etc.; they do not need to be
cooked too much and some of the firmer sorts may remain in quarters
solid enough for a pie. Another plan is to peel but not core the
suspicious ones, then let them freeze solid, when frozen pack them in a
box and cover. Keep them where they will not thaw. When you wish for a
dish of baked apples, put them in your baking pan, scatter a little
sugar over them and put them in a quick oven without letting them thaw,
when done, they should each be whole and a pretty brown color.


BEANS.

Beans are a nice winter vegetable, but cooked with pork as "baked
beans," are too strong for daily use, but are a desirable article of
food cooked more plainly. Choose the small white beans, put them in a
saucepan with as much cold water, as will cover them well and a small
pinch of baking soda; when they have simmered a few minutes drain off
the water and replace it with hot water and a little salt; if possible
let them cook without boiling hard; when tender drain, and dish with a
liberal piece of butter and a dust of pepper. They are also good thrown
when drained into the frying pan with some dripping, pepper and salt,
and heated a few minutes over the fire. The only attention they require
in cooking is lest they melt into soup when nearly cooked.


FRIED BEETS.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.

Boil until tender, slice and put in stewpan with a teaspoon of vinegar,
half the juice of a lemon, one half teaspoonful each sugar and salt, a
grate of nutmeg and a dash of pepper. Add two tablespoonfuls of stock, a
teaspoon butter, and let simmer one half hour.


CREAMED CABBAGE.

MISS J. E. FRASER.

Cut a medium sized cabbage in quarters. Take out the stem, put into a
kettle of boiling water, cook for ten minutes, drain and cover with cold
water. This will destroy the odor so unpleasant. When cold, chop fine,
season with salt and pepper. Make a sauce of two tablespoons of butter,
one tablespoon flour, mix smooth, add one pint of milk; cook in this
sauce slowly for three quarters of an hour.


STEWED CUCUMBERS.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

Peel a nice straight cucumber, cut in four lengthwise, scoop out all
seeds, and cut it in pieces about three inches long; throw these into a
saucepan of boiling water with a little salt. When they bend under the
touch, they are done, drain in a sieve, then put in a stewpan with a
good sized piece of butter, finely chopped parsley salt and pepper. Toss
over the fire till thoroughly heated through and serve in a hot dish.


OYSTER CABBAGE.

MRS. D. M. COOK.

water until tender, drain and lay in dish. Put pint of milk on fire,
just before boiling, add one tablespoon flour, rubbed smooth in a little
cold milk, butter, nearly all the cheese grated, mustard and cayenne.
Boil until thick as custard, then pour over macaroni, sprinkle
remainder of cheese on top with some small pieces of butter; if used
immediately bake twenty minutes, if allowed to get cold one half hour.


CREAM-BAKED ONIONS.

MRS. J. S. THOM.

Pare as many good-sized onions as required and cover with boiling water,
boil for ten minutes, then drain. Cover again with boiling water to
which add one half teaspoon of salt, and cook till tender. Drain
carefully and put the onions in a baking dish, place on each a teaspoon
of butter, add pepper and salt to taste, then fill the dish half full of
milk and cover with a layer of fine bread-crumbs. Bake till a delicate
brown.

MISS GRACE MACMILLAN.

Eight cold boiled potatoes chopped fine. Put into the saucepan a piece
of butter the size of an egg. When it melts stir in the potatoes,
stirring them till brown, then pour in four well beaten eggs, and stir
them well through the potatoes. Serve very hot.


SWEET POTATOES STUFFED.

MRS. ARCHIBALD LAURIE.

Four large sized sweet potatoes baked until tender, then cut carefully
in two. Cut a piece off each end, so they will stand, then scoop out,
leaving the skins perfect. Mash the potato fine with an egg dressing as
follows: boil four eggs hard, mash the yolks to a paste with cream to
thin, salt and pepper to taste and a little mustard if liked; with this
mixture fill the skins, place a piece of butter on top of each, and bake
until well browned. Serve in individual saucers with a small doyley
under.


POTATO FRILL.

MRS. FRANK GLASS.

Boil and mash some potatoes, working in a little milk and butter but not
enough to make the paste soft; while hot add one beaten egg. Shape this
paste into a fence on the inside round of a shallow dish, fluting it
with the round handle of a knife. Set one minute in a hot oven but not
long enough to cause the fence to crack. Glaze quickly with butter and
pour the meat carefully within the wall. The mince should not be so thin
as to wash away the frill.


POTATO PUFF.

MISS CORDELIA JACKSON.

Take two cupfuls of cold mashed potato, and stir into it six
teaspoonfuls of melted butter, beating to a white cream before adding
anything else. Then put with this two eggs, whipped very light and a
teacupful of cream or milk, salting to taste. Beat all well, pour into a
deep dish, and bake in a quick oven until it is nicely browned. If
properly mixed it will come out of the oven light, puffy and delectable.

the oven to brown slightly.


POTATO FRICASSE.

MRS. J. T. SMYTHE.

Cut into thin slices one half pound of fat salt pork. Place in stewpan,
when brown, add an onion sliced and a little cold water, cook a few
minutes. Cut up a number of good sized potatoes, add this to onion and
pork and one half teaspoon of pepper. Cover well with cold water. Let
this boil hard for hours. If about half an hour before serving, it is
found not to be thick enough, take off cover and boil until it does
thicken.


PEAS WITH CREAM SAUCE.

MRS. STOCKING.

Put one quart of peas in a kettle of salted boiling water and cook
fifteen minutes; drain, put a tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, add a

MRS. DAVID BELL.

Cut in slices half an inch thick, peel and remove the spongy portion;
fry in hot dripping or butter, pepper and salt; also nice to make a

ENTREES AND MEATS RECHAUFFE.


BEEF CROQUETTES.

MISS FRANCIS FRY.

Two cups beef (minced fine), one cup stock, two pounds flour, one pound
butter, one teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar, ditto of onion and salt,
one half teaspoon pepper, two eggs, bread or biscuit crumbs. Make a
thick sauce by cooking flour and butter; add gradually stock and lemon
juice, season; add chopped meat with the onion and one egg. Cook five
minutes and turn out to cool. Form into shape roll in beaten egg and
crumbs, and fry in boiling lard.


CREAM OF CHICKEN.

MRS. ARCHIE COOK.

Pound three quarters of a pound of chicken, veal or rabbit until quite
smooth, then pound one half pound of panada (bread soaked in hot milk),
and mix the two together, add two tablespoonfuls of thick soubise
sauce, an ounce and a quarter butter, two tablespoons sherry, a little
pepper and salt and three whole eggs. Pass the mixture through a fine
wire sieve and then add two tablespoons of thick cream. Butter some
small timbale moulds and fill them with the mixture, remembering to hit
the moulds on the table after having put the mixture into them and steam
them about fifteen minutes. Turn them out carefully and serve hot.
Tomato sauce poured around them is an improvement. If preferred they can
be cold and decorated with aspic jelly and a ragout made of truffles,
cooked tongue, or ham and button mushrooms, or a little tomato salad

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSING.


    "To make a perfect salad, there should be a spendthrift for oil, a
    miser for vinegar, a wise man for salt, and a madcap to stir the
    ingredients up, and mix them well together."--SPANISH PROVERB.


APPLE AND CELERY SALAD.

MRS. R. M. STOCKING.

    One day at the house of a charming friend,
      From dishes of dainty blue,
    I ate something good which puzzled me much,
      The secret I'll tell to you.

    2. "This looks like salad, my dear," said I,
      "T'is celery surely I see,
    And mayonnaise yellow and thick and rich,
      What may this rare flavor be."

    3. "A firm spicy apple," she said with a smile,
      "Cut into pieces like dice--
    I used equal parts, with celery white,
      And my salad was made in a trice."


CABBAGE SALAD.

MRS. SMYTHE.

half dessert spoon of pepper and salt, one small onion sliced fine, a
couple of radishes sliced, two hard boiled eggs. Crush the yolks into

one grain cayenne, yolks two eggs, one tablespoonful vinegar, one
tablespoonful capers, one head of lettuce, one gill salad oil, one
tablespoonful of cream, white of egg beaten to a stiff froth. Cut the
chicken into small square pieces and remove the skin. The celery should
be well washed and also cut into pieces of a similar size. Put into a
bowl the yolks of eggs, drop into this drop by drop, the oil, and beat
them together, the mixture should resemble thick cream, add the vinegar.
Put the chicken and celery together in a salad bowl and pour over the
compound, sprinkle on also pepper and salt and cayenne; mix all
thoroughly together with a fork. Arrange the lettuce around the edge of
the salad bowl, sprinkle the capers over the top and garnish the centre

vinegar; mix well with a raw egg well beaten, half a pint of sour or
sweet cream, and mix with other ingredients: garnish with either salad
or parsley. This is excellent.


LETTUCE CHICKEN SALAD.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.

Having skinned a pair of cold chickens, either mince or divide into
small threads. Mix with it a little smoked tongue or cold ham, grated
rather than chopped. Have ready one or two fine fresh lettuces, washed,
drained and cut small. Put the cut lettuce in a bowl, place upon it the
minced chicken in a close heap in the centre. For the dressing: the
yolks of four eggs well beaten, a teaspoon of white sugar, a little
cayenne, no salt: if you have ham or tongue with the chicken two
teaspoonfuls of made mustard, two tables of vinegar, and four tables of
salad oil. Stir this mixture well, put it into a small saucepan and let
boil three minutes (not more), stirring it all the time, then set to
cool, when quite cold cover with it thickly the heap of chicken in
centre of salad. To ornament it have ready one half dozen hard boiled
eggs, which after the shell is peeled off must be thrown directly into a
pan of cold water to prevent discoloring. Cut each egg (white and yolk
together) lengthways, into four large pieces of equal size and shape,
lay the pieces upon the salad all round the heap of chicken in a
slanting direction. Have ready also some red cold beet, cut in small
cones of equal size, arrange them outside the circle of egg. This salad
should be prepared immediately before dinner or supper. The colder it is
the better.


SALMON OR LOBSTER SALAD DRESSING.

MRS. ANDREW T. LOVE.

Two eggs, two tablespoons melted butter, one tablespoon mustard, one
half cup milk, (with a small pinch baking soda to prevent curdling), one
half cup vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix mustard and butter, then eggs
well beaten, milk, stir well, add vinegar, boil gently till as thick as
cream. Celery chopped up and added gives a nice flavor and crispness.
If cooked in a double boiler it is less likely to burn. This does nicely
with chicken or lamb.


SOMETHING NICE FOR THE SALAD COURSE OF A LUNCHEON.

MRS. FRANK DUGGAN.

Select round tomatoes of equal size; peel and scoop out the seeds from
the stem end. Place the tomatoes on the ice till shortly before serving;
then fill with celery that has been chopped fine and mixed with
mayonnaise. Arrange the filled tomatoes on lettuce leaves on a flat dish
or plate. Garnish the dish further by placing the ends of celery and
sprigs of parsley on top of each tomato. Serve with toasted cheese,
biscuits, or salted wafers. Be generous with the filling. Use plenty of
the mayonnaise and celery and fill tomatoes to the top.

METHOD: Scald the milk and melt the butter with it, pour this on the
eggs well beaten, add the salt and then the vinegar, this last slowly,
and stir all the time. Then cook in a pot in hot water, until as thick
as custard, when cold add the mustard.--Prepared mustard is made as
follows: two tablespoons mustard, one teaspoon sugar, half a teaspoon
salt, enough boiling water to mix. Half this quantity is enough for
ordinary use. The above recipe is also good for chicken.




EGGS.


    Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall.
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    All the king's horses and all the king's men
    Could not set Humpty Dumpty back again.
                              --MOTHER GOOSE.


Try the freshness of eggs by putting them into cold water; those that
sink the soonest are the freshest.

Never attempt to boil an egg without watching the time-piece. Put the
eggs in boiling water. In three minutes eggs will be boiled soft; in
four minutes the white part will be cooked; in ten minutes they will be
hard enough for salad.


PRESERVING EGGS.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

(Which keeps them from June to June.)

Half a gallon of fresh lime to five gallons of water added by degrees,
two and one half gallons the first day, the rest next, then add one half
gallon coarse salt, stir two or three times a day for three days, after
this drop in four eggs gently. To test the strength of the lime-water
drop in an egg that you know to be fresh, and if it floats the lime is
too strong, add another gallon or more of water until you find the egg
dropping to the bottom.

WELSH RAREBIT.

MISS BEEMER.

Select richest and best American cheese, (Canadian will do), the milder
the better, as melting brings out strength. To make five rarebits take
one pound cheese grate and put in the saucepan; add ale (old is best)
enough to thin the cheese sufficiently, say about a wine glassful to
each rarebit. Place over the fire, stir until it is melted. Have ready a

PIES.


    "Who dare deny the truth, there's poetry in pie."--LONGFELLOW.


"Ingenuity, good judgment and great care should be used in making all
kinds of pastry. Use very cold water, and just as little as possible;
roll thin and always from you; prick the bottom crust with a fork to
prevent blistering; then brush it well with the white of egg, and
sprinkle thick with granulated sugar. This will give you a firm rich
crust.

"For all kinds of fruit pies, prepare the bottom crust as above. Stew
the fruit and sweeten to taste. If juicy put a good layer of corn-starch
on top of the fruit before putting on the top crust. This will prevent
the juice from running out, and will form a nice jelly throughout the
pie. Be sure you have plenty of incisions in the top crust; then pinch
it closely around the edge; sprinkle some granulated sugar on top, and
bake in a moderate oven."

FRIED CREAM.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

Everyone should try this receipt; it will surprise many to know how soft
cream could be enveloped in the crust while it is an exceedingly good
dish for a dinner course or for lunch or tea. When the pudding is hard,
it can be rolled in the egg and bread crumbs. The moment the egg touches
the hot lard it hardens and secures the pudding which softens to a
creamy substance very delicious. Ingredients, one pint of milk, five
ounces of sugar (little more than half a cupful,) butter the size of a
hickory nut, yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, and
one tablespoonful of flour, (a generous half cupful altogether), stick
of cinnamon one inch long, one half teaspoonful of vanilla. Put the
cinnamon into the milk and when it is just about to boil, stir in the
sugar, cornstarch and flour, the two latter rubbed smooth with two or
three tablespoons of extra cold milk: stir it over the fire for fully
two minutes, to cook well the starch and flour; take it from the fire,
stir in the beaten yolks of the eggs and return it a few minutes to set
them; now again taking it from the fire remove the cinnamon, stir in the
butter and vanilla and pour it on a buttered platter until one third of
an inch high. When cold and stiff cut the pudding into parallelograms,
about three inches long and two inches wide: roll them carefully, first
in sifted cracker crumbs then in eggs (slightly beaten and sweetened)
then again in cracker-crumbs. Dip these into boiling hot lard (a wire
basket should be used if convenient) and when of fine color, take them
out and place them in the oven for four or five minutes to better soften
the pudding. Sprinkle over pulverized sugar and serve immediately.

CAKES.


    "With weights and measures just and true,
        Oven of even heat,
     Well buttered tins and quiet nerves,
        Success will be complete."


"In making cake, the ingredients should be of the first quality--the
flour super-fine, and always sifted; the butter fresh and sweet and not
too much salted. Coffee A, or granulated sugar is best for cakes. Much
care should be taken in breaking and separating the eggs, and equal care
taken as regards their freshness. Break each egg separately in a teacup;
then into the vessels in which they are to be beaten. Never use an egg
when the white is the least discolored. Before beating the whites remove
every particle of yolk. If any is allowed to remain, it will prevent
them becoming as stiff and dry as required. Deep earthen bowls are best
for mixing cake, and a wooden spoon or paddle is best for beating
batter. Before commencing to make your cake, see that all the
ingredients required are at hand. By so doing the work may be done in
much less time.

"The lightness of a cake depends not only upon the making, but the
baking also. It is highly important to exercise judgment respecting the
heat of the oven, which must be regulated according to the cake you
bake, and the stove you use. Solid cake requires sufficient heat to
cause it to rise and brown nicely without scorching. If it should brown
too fast cover with thick brown paper. All light cakes require quick
heat and are not good if baked in a cool oven. Those having molasses as
an ingredient scorch more quickly, consequently should be baked in a
moderate oven. Every cook should use her own judgment, and by frequent
baking she will in a very short time be able to tell by the appearance
of either bread or cake whether it is sufficiently done."

CANNING FRUIT.

MISS M. SAMPSON.

To can strawberries, raspberries or plums: to each pound of sugar add
one half pint of water, boil till you have a rich syrup, let stand till
cold; have your jars packed full of raw fruit (not crushed) and fill
with the cold syrup, put on the covers and screws, (not the rubber
rings,) and place in cold water up to the neck of the jars, you will
need straw or chips between the jars to prevent them touching each other
or burning on the bottom, let the water boil for fifteen minutes, have
some hot syrup to fill jars, put on rubber rings, screw up tightly and
keep in a cool dark place.


CANNED FRUIT JUICES.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

Fruit juice may be kept for a long time by canning the same as whole
fruit. They are convenient for water ices and summer beverages. Mash
the fruit and rub the pulp through a fine sieve. Mix about three pounds
of sugar with one quart of fruit juice and pulp. Fill Mason's jars with
the syrup, cover and place in a heater with cold water to cover nearly
to the top of the jar. Let the water boil half an hour, then fill each
jar to the brim, seal and cool in the water.


TO BRANDY PEACHES.

To three pounds of sugar add a pint and a half water; boil and skim it;
prepare eight pounds of ripe clingstone peaches: wash and rub with a
coarse towel until all the down is off, then pierce them with a fork and
throw them into the syrup and boil them until a sharp straw can
punctuate them: as they soften put them into your jar, which must be
kept closely covered. Boil your syrup until it thickens, while hot, add
a quart of the best brandy and throw it over your peaches, tie the jar
down closely.


CURRANT JELLY.

Currants should not be over ripe. Equal parts of red and white currants
or currants and raspberries make a delicately colored and flavored
jelly. Pick over and remove the leaves and poor fruit, and if filthy
wash and drain them but do not stem them. Mash them in a porcelain
kettle, with wooden pestle without heating as that makes the jelly dark.
Let them drain in a flannel bag over night. _Do not_ squeeze them, or
the jelly will be cloudy. In the morning measure a bowl of sugar for
each bowl of juice, and heat the sugar carefully in an earthern dish in
the oven. Stir it often to prevent burning: boil the juice twenty
minutes and skim thoroughly. Add the hot sugar and boil from three to
five minutes or till it thickens on a spoon when exposed to the air.
Turn at once into glasses and let them remain in the sun several days
then cover with paper dipped in brandy and paste paper over the tops of
the glasses. One who is authority on this subject recommends covering
with melted paraffine, or putting a lump of paraffine in the jelly while
still hot. After draining the juice, the currants may be squeezed and a
second quality of jelly made, it may not be clear but will answer for
some purposes.


CANDIED PEEL.

MRS. DAVID BELL.

Put the lemon or orange skins, in strong salt and water, when they are
soft enough to pass a straw through, take them out and soak them
changing the water till all the salt taste is gone, then simmer them in
thin brown sugar syrup till clear; take them out, place on a dish, and
let them remain for a day or two. Boil the syrup till thick, then fill
the skins with it and put away to dry.


LEMON HONEY. (Filling.)

MRS. FRANK GLASS.

One pound of butter, four pounds of sugar, two dozen eggs leaving out
eight whites, rind and juice of one dozen lemons. Put all together, and
let simmer until it thickens like honey. Put into jars, can be kept for
years.


PUMPKIN JAM.

MRS. HENRY THOMSON.

Peel and seed, then, cut into pieces two or three inches square, lay on
a dish to dry till next day, then put into the preserving pan and barely
cover with molasses. To a medium sized pumpkin put one ounce cloves and
about a dessertspoon of ginger or as much as will taste; let it boil
until the pumpkin is quite soft. One half dozen apples (sour) just cored
not peeled is a great improvement. The molasses must only come to the
top of your pieces, not nearly cover them.


FRUIT JELLY.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.

Dissolve two ounces of tartaric acid in one quart of cold water, pour it
on to five pounds of strawberries, currants, or raspberries. Let it
stand twenty-four hours. Then strain it without pressing or bruising the
fruit. To every pint of clear juice add one and one half pounds of white
sugar. Stir frequently till the sugar is dissolved. Then bottle and cork
air tight. Keep in a cool, dark place. When required for use dissolve
one ounce gelatine in one half pint boiling water, add one and one half
pints syrup. Pour in a mould and set away to stiffen. Serve with whipped
cream.


GRAPE JELLY.

MRS. GEORGE ELLIOTT.

Mash the grapes in a preserving pan, put them over the fire and cook
until thoroughly done. Strain through a jelly bag and to each pint of
juice allow one pound of sugar. Boil the juice rapidly for ten minutes,
add the sugar made hot in the pan in the oven, and boil rapidly three
minutes more. Excellent.


MARMALADE.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

Cut the oranges in half and work in a spoon to remove the inside. Slice
the peel very fine. Take the skin and seeds from the pulp and mix peel
and pulp together and weigh them. For every pound of fruit, pour three
pints of cold water over it and let stand twenty four hours. Boil till
chips are tender (about an hour and a half). This absorbs a great deal
of the fluid. Let it stand another twenty-four hours. To every pound of
boiled fruit, put one and one quarter pounds of sugar. Boil till syrup
jellies, and chips are transparent. Boil pippins and skins in a gallon
of water, and strain.


BITTER ORANGE MARMALADE.

MRS. R. STEWART.

One dozen bitter oranges, three sweet oranges, three lemons. Slice or
shave the bitter oranges and lemons _very thin_ laying aside the pips
in a bowl; pare or slice the sweet oranges. To every pint of fruit add
four pints cold water, cover the pips with water, let stand for
twenty-four hours, boil till quite tender putting the pips in a muslin
bag when ready: to every pound of fruit add one and one half pounds
white sugar and boil till it jellies, from twenty to thirty minutes.


CURRANT MARMALADE.

MRS. W. W. HENRY.

Seven pounds of currants, six pounds of sugar, two pounds of raisins,

seeds, chop fine.


RHUBARB MARMALADE.

MRS. THEOPHILUS OLIVER.

Peel and cut the rhubarb into small pieces, take the rind of one lemon,
cut into chips; to each two pounds of the rhubarb then weigh three
quarters of a pound of white sugar to each pound of the fruit. Put the
fruit and sugar in a basin in layers and let it stand all night. Pour
off the syrup and boil it for twenty minutes, add the fruit and boil for
twenty minutes more, when the marmalade should be ready to put in pots.


PRESERVED RAW PINEAPPLE.

MRS. W. COOK.

Pare the pineapples and take out all the eyes. With a sharp knife, cut
the pineapple in thin slices cutting down sides until the heart is
reached, this is to be discarded. Weigh the sliced pineapple and put in
a large earthen dish. Add to it as many pounds of granulated sugar as
there are pounds of fruit and stir well. Pack this mixture in quart or
pint jars: cover tightly and put away. The pineapple will keep a year or
more and be perfectly tender and fine flavored. It is best to choose
fruit not over ripe.


PRESERVED TOMATOES. (Original).

MRS. E. A. PFEIFFER.

Take two gallons large smooth green tomatoes, make a pickle of three
pints of vinegar, and one quart of water, two tablespoons salt, one
tablespoon each, spice, cloves and cinnamon, one pound of sugar: scald
spices ten minutes in vinegar and water, then add tomatoes and scald
till tender, slice for table, pour sauce over. N. B. Strain spices, over
the tomatoes, and seal while warm; some prefer without salt.

MRS. ERNEST F. WURTELE.

To fifteen pounds tomatoes, put three ounces of white sugar, and three
ounces of salt, boil very hard for twenty minutes. Fill up pint jars to
overflowing and screw down tight; as they cool off, screw them again so
as to be sure they are quite tight. This quantity fills ten pint jars.
Skin the tomatoes before boiling, this is quickly done by pouring
boiling water over them.

Pick over and wash your grapes. Concords are said to be preferable. Put
them in your porcelain kettle with just enough water to prevent
sticking. When the skins crack remove from fire, pour into a flannel
bag, not more than a quart at once, and press out the juice. Add nearly
half as much sugar as juice and return to the kettle. When the sugar is
all dissolved and the juice boiling, pour into cans and seal. Pint cans

bladder over it. Place the jar in a deep saucepan of cold water which
must not be allowed to cover the cork. Let it boil slowly four hours or
more and strain through a sieve. One tablespoonful of this is equal to a
cup of ordinary beef tea.

pint of water, juice of four lemons and rind of two, five eggs, shells
and all, whites beaten well, one ounce cinnamon, one ounce cloves, sugar
to taste, about one and one half pounds and one bottle of sherry. Put
all into the pan and stir well. Let it boil a minute or two and then
throw in a cup of cold water, cover closely for ten minutes, skim and
run through the bag.

BUTTER-MILK SCONES.

MRS. FRANK LAURIE.

One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls cream of tartar and one of baking
soda, a little piece of butter the size of an egg and one teaspoonful of
salt; mix the butter well in the flour with the hands, put the salt,

thicken. Bake in a moderate oven.


GRAHAM MUFFINS.

MUFFINS.

MRS. HENRY THOMSON.

melted butter, four teaspoons baking powder and pinch of salt.


POP OVERS.

MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.

A breakfast cup of flour, a cup of milk, three eggs and a pinch of salt:
beat the eggs very well, add them to the milk and beat in the flour;
the mixture ought to be the consistency of good custard. Butter the
moulds very well before putting in the batter; don't put more than a
tablespoonful in each. The oven should be very hot and the pop-overs
will only take ten minutes to bake.


POP OVERS.

MISS M'GEE.

Three eggs well beaten, add a tablespoon of melted butter and a little
salt, pour this mixture over one cup of flour and add milk enough to
make a thin batter.


JOHNNY CAKE.

MRS. STUART OLIVER.

size of an egg, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, about two small cups each
of Indian meal and flour (to make a thin batter.)


SHORT-CAKE.

MRS. R. M. STOCKING.

One pint of flour, one cup of sour cream, one small teaspoon soda, three
eggs.


SHORTBREAD.

MRS. W. REID.

Place on a bake-board two pounds of sifted flour, one pound butter (if
salt, wash,) and half a pound of sugar; this quantity will make four
cakes. Knead all altogether and when well mixed form into cakes half an
inch thick, pinch round the edge, and probe all over with a fork, place
some confits in the centre, then a sheet of stiff paper under each cake,
place on the baking sheet and bake in an oven of moderate heat.


ALMOND SHORTBREAD.

MRS. W. COOK.

One pound ground sweet almonds, eight ounces sugar, eight ounces sifted
flour, eight ounces good butter. The yolks of eight eggs, about eight
drops of essence of ratafia. First see that the ground almonds are
fresh. Mix them with the flour and sugar and then very, very carefully
add a few drops of ratafia. Mix everything thoroughly. Make a space in
centre, and in this drop the yolks of the eggs. Then melt the butter,
add that and mix up the whole together until it is a nice firm stiff
paste. This should now be rolled a great many times; cannot be rolled
too much. When sufficiently rolled to appear like a strip of cream
coloured satin a quarter of an inch thick, cut in small squares with a
sharp knife. Pinch the edges of each square and in centre of each cake,
put a split half of blanched almond. Butter baking tins and bake in a
moderate oven to a fine pale yellow tint. These are delicious and are
particularly good in summer eaten with fruit.


SCOTCH SHORT BREAD.

MRS. BLAIR.

One pound of flour, one half pound butter, six ounces sugar; cream
butter and sugar, add flour. Roll into a smooth ball and work down until
half an inch in thickness, an operation which is rather difficult for a
novice, as it is apt to crack at the edges; but the knack is soon
learned, and the more it is worked the better. Prick with a small
skewer, strew with large carraway comfits, and bake slowly, a pale
brown.


BANANA FRITTERS.

MRS. GEORGE ELLIOTT.

Take six bananas, peel and dip in beaten white of egg, then roll in
bread crumbs. Fry in butter a golden brown. Put them on a dish, squeeze
lemon juice over them, also a little sifted sugar.


APPLE FRITTERS.

MRS. HARRY LAURIE.

Three tart apples, two eggs; one cup milk; one teaspoonful salt; about
one and one half cups of flour; one teaspoonful baking powder. Pare
and core the apples; cut them into rings; dust with sugar and cinnamon;
stand aside to use. Beat eggs without separating until light; add milk,
salt and sufficient flour to make a soft batter; beat well and add the
baking powder; beat again; Have ready very hot a deep pan of lard, dip
each ring of apple in the batter, drop it in the fat and fry until
brown. Serve hot, dusted with powdered sugar.


FRENCH PANCAKES.

MRS. BENSON BENNETT.

Four eggs, weight of four eggs in butter, sugar and flour, one half a
teaspoonful of soda, one half teaspoonful of cream of tartar. As much
milk as will make a batter. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add
the four eggs well beaten stir in all the other ingredients. Bake in tin
plates.


SCOTCH HAGGIS.

MRS. ANDREW T. LOVE.

Boil a sheep's draught for three quarters of an hour in as much water as
will cover it. Grate down the liver and mince the heart and lights very
fine. Mince two pounds of onions, and two pounds of beef suet, put in
three or four handsful of oatmeal with pepper and salt to taste. Having
these ingredients very well mixed, put them into the bag with a little
of the boilings of the draught. Pick the bag well to prevent its
bursting. It requires from three to four hours boiling, so if you make
it a day or two before you intend using it, it is better to boil it
two hours after it is made, and two hours when going to use it. Great
care must be taken in having the bag very particularly scraped and
cleansed by frequent washings in salt and water. The liver and heart,
etc., are better, to be boiled before, then they can be grated down
easily. Half of this receipt makes a very good sized Haggis.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
