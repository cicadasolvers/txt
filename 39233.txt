THOMAS MORE AND JOHN FISHER.

Although I am afraid "NOTES AND QUERIES" may not be considered as open
to contributions purely bibliographical, and admitting I am uncertain
whether the following copy of the treatise of John Fisher, Bishop of
Rochester, has been before noted, I am induced to send this extract from
Techener's _Bulletin du Bibliophile_ for May 1851. The book is in the
library at Douai.

  "This Treatise concernynge the fruytful Saynges of David the King
  and prophete in the seven penytencyall psalmes, devyded in _ten_
  sermons, was made and compyled by the ryght reverente fader in god
  Johan Fyssher, doctour of dyvinyte and bysshop of Rochester, at
  the exortacion and sterynge of the most excellent pryncesse
  Margarete, Countesse of Richemount and Derby, and moder to out
  souverayne Lorde Kynge H[=e]ry the VII."

It is described as a small 4to., printed upon vellum, in Gothic letters,
at London, 1508, by Wynkyn de Worde, and contains 146 leaves. On the
first leaf it has a portcullis, crowned with the motto "Dieu et mon
Droit." On the recto of the last leaf there is--

  "Here endeth the exposycyon of the 7 psalmes. Enprynted at London
  in the fletestrete, at the sygne of ye Sonne, by Wynkyn de Worde.
  In the yere of oure lorde M.CCCCC.VIII. ye 16 day of ye moneth of
  Juyn. The XXIII. yere of ye reygne of our souverayne Lorde Kynge
  H[=e]ry the Seventh."

At the back, there is the sun, the monogram of Wynkyn de Worde--the
letters W. C. displayed as usual--and beneath, "Wynkyn de Worde."

At the beginning of the book, "sur une garde en velin" (a fly-leaf of
vellum?), there is written in a very neat hand the following ten verses,
the profession of faith of Thomas Morus and of his friend John Fisher,
Bishop of Rochester:

      "The surest meanes for to attaine
      The perfect waye to endlesse blisse
      Are happie lief and to remaine
      W'thin ye church where virtue is;
      And if thy conscience be sae sounde
      To thinse thy faith is truth indeede
      Beware in thee noe schisme be founde
      That unitie may have her meede;
      If unitie thow doe embrace
      In heaven (_en_?)joy possesse thy place."

Beneath--

      "Qui non recte vivit in unitate ecclesiae
      Catholicae, salvus esse non potest."

And lower on the same page--

      "Thomas Morus d[=n]s cancellarius Angliae
      Joh. Fisher Epus Roffensis."

It is traditionally reported, upon the testimony of some Anglican
Benedictines (an order now extinct), that the lines which contain the
profession of faith, and those which follow, are in the handwriting of
Bishop Fisher, and that the work was presented by him to the
chancellor, during their imprisonment, when by order of Henry VIII. the
chancellor was denied the consolation of his books.

In the same library there is a fine Psalter, which belonged to Queen
Elizabeth. The _Livre d'Heures_ of Mary Queen of Scots was here also to
be found: "Maria, glorious martyr and Queen of Scotland." It is
conjectured these books were brought to Douai by the fugitive English
Roman Catholic priests. In 1790 their collections were confiscated and
given to the public library of Douai. It would be of interest to
ascertain, if possible, the authenticity of the _Heures a l'Usage_,
stated to have belonged to Mary Queen of Scots. Upon this point one may
be permitted to be sceptical. I have myself seen two. One of these, it
was said, had been used by Mary on the scaffold, and contained a note in
the handwriting, as I think, of James II. attesting the fact. It was
understood to have been obtained from a monastery in France. The other,
a small Prayer Book MS. in vellum, of good execution, had the signature
"M." with a line I think over it of "O Lord, deliver me from my
enemies!" in French. I am, however, now writing from memory, and, in the
first case, of very many years.

Whether the line, "Maria, glorious martyr and Queen of Scotland," be
written in the Psalter, or has been added by the mental excitement of M.
Duthilloeul, the librarian at Douai, I cannot decide. The grand
culmination of "and Queen of Scotland" forms doubtless a very striking
anti-thesis: but neither the possessor of the book nor a priest would
have so sunk the martyr, although a woman and a queen were alike
concerned, as this line does. Lowndes states there is a copy of the
bishop's treatise on vellum at Cambridge. A copy is in the British
Museum; but the title, according, to Lowndes, has _seven_ sermons. It
will be observed the title now given has _ten_.

NOTES ON NEWSPAPERS.

The social elements of society in the seventeenth century were more
simple in their character and development than at the present period.
The population was comparatively small, and therefore the strivings for
success in any pursuit did not involve that severe conflict which is so
frequently the case in the present day. Society then was more of a
community than it is now. It had not public bodies to aid it. It was
left more to its own inherent resources for reciprocal good, and for
mutual help. The temptations to evade and dissemble, in matters of
business, or private and public negotiations, were not so strong as they
now are. Its transactions were more transparent and defined, because
they were fewer and less complicated than many of our own. We readily
grant that society now, in its social, religious, and commercial
aspects, enjoys advantages immeasurably superior to those of any former
period; still there are some few advantages which it had then, that it
cannot possess now. The following advertisements, from the newspapers of
the time, will illustrate the truth of the foregoing remarks:

From a _Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_.

  Friday, January 26, 1693/4.

  "One that is fit to keep a Warehouse, be a Steward, or do any
  Business that can be supposed an intelligent Man that has been a
  Shopkeeper is fit for, and can give any Security that can be
  desired, as far as Ten Thousand Pound goes, and has some Estate of
  his own, desires an Employment of One hundred Pounds a year, or
  upwards. I can give an account of him."

That a man having 10,000_l._ to give as security, and in possession of
an estate, should require a situation of 100_l._ per annum, sounds oddly
enough in our ears. "I can give an account of him," denotes that the
editor was a man well known and duly appreciated. He appears to have
been a scribe useful in many ways. He was known, and knowing.

  Friday, February 2, 1693/4.

  "A very eminent Brewer, and one I know to be a very honest
  Gentleman, wants an Apprentice. I can give an account of him."

In what sense the word "honest" must here be taken it is difficult to
define. As an eminent brewer, we should naturally conclude he must have
been an honest man. He is here very eminent and very honest.

  Friday March 16, 1693/4.

  "Many Masters want Apprentices, and many Youths want Masters. If
  they apply themselves to me, I'll strive to help them. Also for
  variety of valuable services."

Here is the editor of a paper offering his help to masters and
apprentices for their mutual good. Let us suppose an advertisement of
this kind appearing in _The Times_ of our own day. Printing-house Square
would not contain a tithe of the individuals who would present
themselves for the reception of this accommodating aid. In such a case
the editors (as it regards their particular duties) would be cyphers,
for a continuous absorption of their time would necessarily occur in the
carrying out of this benevolent offer. This advertisement may be
considered as _multum in parvo_, giving the wants of the many in an
announcement of three or four lines, connecting them with a variety of
services which in those days were thought to be valuable. How greatly
are we assisted by these little incidents in forming correct views of
the state of society at that period.

The next advertisement shows the value set upon the services of one who
was to perform the duties of a clerk, and to play well on the violin.

  "If any young Man that plays well on a Violin, and writes a good
  Hand, desires a Clerkship, I can help him to Twenty Pounds a
  year."

Of course twenty pounds was of more value then than it is now: still it
seems a small sum for the performance of such duties, for twelve months.
Here is musical talent required for the amusement of others, in
combination with the daily duties of a particular profession. An
efficient musician, and a good writer, and all for 20_l._ per annum! We
learn by the editor's "I can help him," his readiness to assist all who
would advertise in his journal, to obtain those employments which their
advertisements specified.

  Friday, April 6, 1694.

  "A Grocer of good business desires an Apprentice of good growth."

The "good growth" must have been intended to convey the idea of height
and strength.

My next article shall be devoted to advertisements of another class,
further illustrating the state of society and the peculiarities of the
people at the end of the seventeenth century.

TREATISE OF EQUIVOCATION.

As having originated the inquiry in "NOTES AND QUERIES"[1] respecting
this Treatise, under the signature of J. M., I feel great obligation
both to the editor of that journal, and the editor of the Treatise
itself, for having brought it to light by publication, and added it to
the stock of accurate and very important historical information. Indeed,
a real vacancy was left for it; and it is a subject of high
self-gratulation, that a boon previously, and for a length of time,
hidden and unproductive, is now accessible and operative without limit.
I have no doubt that all your readers, and the whole reading public,
join with me in rejoicing that the editorship of the work has fallen
into hands so competent and so successful.

  [Footnote 1: Vol. i., pp. 263. 357.; Vol. ii., pp. 136. 168. 446.
  490.]

I was, not for ten, but twenty years or more, in quest of the MS. now so
happily made public property, and should have fallen upon it much
earlier, but for the misleading title under which it appears, where it
_is_ really; for it has been found. In the _Catalogus Lib. MSS._: Ox.
1697, among the Laudian MSS. appears, p. 62., "968.95. _A Treatise_
against _Equivocation, or fraudulent Dissimulation_." _Against!_ when no
such word is in the original, and the real matter and meaning is _for_!
I had, at some early time, marked the very entry; but presuming that the
work had been actually _printed_ (which I believe it was in a very few
copies, which have disappeared), naturally enough I did not pursue the
search in that direction. Others, I am happy, have, and I am gratified.

The work is very important; for there is not a work more evidently
genuine and authentic than this is proved to be by plain historic
evidence, both as to the document itself and the facts which it attests.
The witness, or witnesses, appearing in it, give their testimony
respecting themselves with the most unsuspectable simplicity. They meant
not, and have not, misrepresented themselves: they have proclaimed their
own doctrine for themselves respecting Equivocation and Mental
Reservation--the last of which is really of most importance; and it was
most needful to the Roman body at the time, and under their
circumstances. Their object, for mere safety, was concealment as to
their resorts or residences. They could not exist, as they did, without
the assistance and knowledge of many individuals, some of inferior
class. Against the incessant inquiries to which they were exposed they
had no defence, except the power of disappointing or misleading by
ambiguity or deception, which was completely secured by reserved
termination in the mind to any uttered declaration. Now, there is in
this very Treatise _plain admission_ that all the co-religionists of the
endangered party, particularly a lady who is distinctly noticed, were
not convinced of the moral rectitude of such a procedure; and it was
necessary, or expedient, that their hesitation should be removed. And
this seems to be the main object of the present work. How far it has
succeeded must depend upon the evidence which is adduced.

We have generally had the doctrine of the Roman body on the subject of
the Treatise presented by opponents; here we have it as deliberately
stated by themselves. There is a passage rather observable in p. 103.,
beginning at the bottom and extending to the words "he hath no such
meaning to tell them," of which we are not acquainted with a duplicate.
But the whole has something of the freshness and interest of novelty.

_Macbeth_, it is agreed, I believe, was written in 1607, consequently
after the Powder Plot, when the doctrine before us was brought forward
pointedly against the traitors. Might there not be some reference to the
fact in the Second Act, where the porter of the castle, roused by
repeated knockings, on the murder, after other exclamations in the
manner of the poet, proceeds:

  "Here's an Equivocator, that could swear in both the scales,
  against either scale: who committed treason enough for God's sake,
  yet could not equivocate to heaven. Oh, come in, Equivocator"?

Mr. Jardine will thank your correspondent for pointing out an error or
two which should be corrected in another edition. At p. 44., for
"[Greek: chtho]," in the margin, should be printed "_sub verbo_." The
word in the MS. is a contraction to that effect: the capital "V" has a
curved stroke across the first line of the "V," followed by "_bo_."
Generally the _Dubium_, in alphabetic works of the kind referred to,
ranks under some alphabetic word, one or more, as it may happen; but in
Em. Sa's work the word _Dubium_ comes under the letter D., and this is
meant to be expressed. At p. 49. the footnote should be omitted, as the
Vulgate, which is followed, calls the 1st of _Samuel_ the 1st of
_Kings_. The first line of p. 56. should have "_autem_" instead of
"_antea_." I have inspected the MS. carefully, and therefore speak with
confidence.

NOTES ON VIRGIL.

(_Continued from_ p. 308.)

      IV. "Illum expirantem transfixo pectore flammas
          Turbine corripuit scopuloque infixit acuto."

          Virg. _AEn._ I. 48.

  "TURBINE; volubilitate ventorum. SCOPULO; saxo
  eminenti."--_Servius._

  "Hub sie im Wirbel empor, und spiesst' an ein scharfes Gestein
  ihn."--_Voss._

  "Ipsum vero Pallas fulmine percussum procellae vi scopulo etiam
  allisit."--_Heyne._

  "Impegit rupi acutae."--_Ruaeus._

  "Infixit. _Inflixit_, lectionem quorundam MSS. facile praetulissem,
  et quod statim praecesserit _transfixo_, unde evadit inconcinna
  cognatae dictionis repetitio, et quod etiam AEn. x. 303.:

      "'Namque inflicta vadis, dorso dum pendet iniquo,'

  "si Sidon. Apoll. v. 197. haud tueretur vulgatam scripturam:

                           "'Fixusque Capharei
      Cautibus, inter aquas flammam ructabat Oileus.'"--_Wakefield._

To which criticism of Wakefields's, Forbiger adds: "Praeterea etiam acuto
scopulo _infigendi_ voc. accommodatius videtur quam _infligendi_." And
Wagner: "acuto scopulo _infigi_ melius."

This interpretation and these criticisms are founded altogether on a
false conception of the meaning of the word _infigere_, which is never
to fix _on_, but always either to fix _in_, or to fix _with_, i.e.
pierce _with_. _Scopulo infixit acuto_, _fixed or pinned_ down or to the
ground _with_ a sharp rock; _i.e._ hurled a sharp-pointed rock on him,
so as to nail him to the ground. So (_AEn._ XII. 721.) "Cornua obnixi
infigunt," fix their horns, not _on_, but _in_; infix their horns; stick
their horns into each other; stick each other with their horns: _q.d._
Cornibus se mutuo infigunt: and, exactly parallel to our text:

      "Saturnius me sic _infixit_ Jupiter,
      Jovisque numen Mulcibri adscivit manus.
      Hos ille _cuneos_ fabrica crudeli _inserens_,
      Perrupit artus; qua miser sollertia
      Transverberatus, castrum hoc Furiarum incolo."

      Cicero (translating from AEschylus), _Tuscul. Quaest._ II. 10.

In confirmation of this view of the passage, I may observe: 1st, that it
is easier to imagine a man staked to the ground by a sharp-pointed rock,
than flung on a sharp-pointed rock, so as to remain permanently impaled
on it; and 2dly, that the account given of the transaction, both by
Quintus Calaber and Seneca, agree as perfectly with this view as they
disagree with the opposite:

      [Greek: Kai ny ken exelyxe kakon moron, ei me ar' auto,
      rhexas aian enerthen, epiproeeke kolonen;
      eute paros megaloio kat' Enkeladoio daiphron
      Pallas aeiramene Sikelen epikabbale neson;
      e rh' eti kaietai aien hyp' akamatoio Gigantos,
      aithaloen pneiontos eso chthonos; hos ara Lokron
      amphekalypsen anakta dysammoron oureos akre,
      hypsothen exeripousa, baryne de karteron andra;
      amphi de min thanatoio melas ekichesat' olethros,
      gaie homos dmethenta, kai akamato eni ponto.]

      Quintus Calab. XIV. 579.

And so Seneca; who, having presented us with Ajax clinging to the rock
to which he had swum for safety, after his ship had been sunk, and
himself struck with lightning, and there uttering violent imprecations
against the Deity, adds:

                "Plura cum auderet furens,
      Tridente rupem subruit pulsam pater
      Neptunus, imis exerens undis caput,
      Solvitque montem; quem cadens secum tulit:
      Terraque et igne victus et pelago jacet."

      _Agam._ 552.

And, so also, beyond doubt, we are to understand Sidonius
Apollinaris's--

                                "Fixusque Capharei
      Cautibus, inter aquas flammam ructabat Oileus."

Not, with Wakefield and the other commentators, _fixed on_ the rocks of
Caphareus, but, _pierced with_ the rocks of Caphareus, and lying under
them. Compare (_AEn._ IX. 701.) "fixo pulmone," the pierced lung; "fixo
cerebro" (_AEn._ XII. 537.); "verubus trementia figunt" (_AEn._ I. 216.),
not, fix _on_ the spits, but, stick or pierce _with_ the spits; and
especially (Ovid. _Ibis._ 341.),

      "Viscera sic aliquis scopulus tua figat, ut olim
        Fixa sub Euboico Graia fuere sinu,"

pierced and pinned down with a rock, at the bottom of the Euboean gulf.

TURBINE. SCOPULO.--Not two instruments, _a whirlwind and a rock_, but
one single instrument, _a whirling rock_; scopulo turbineo; in modo
turbinis se circumagente; as if Virgil had said, Solo affixit illum
correptum et transverberatum scopulo acuto in eum maxima vi rotato: or,
more briefly, Turbine scopuli acuti corripuit et infixit. Compare:

      "Praecipitem scopulo atque ingentis turbine saxi
      Excutit effunditque solo."--_AEn._ XII. 531.

                            "Stupet obvia leto
      Turba super stantem, atque emissi turbine montis
      Obruitur."--Stat. _Theb._ II. 564.

      "Idem altas turres saxis et turbine crebro
      Laxat."--Stat. _Theb._ X. 742.

So understood, 1st, the passage is according to Virgil's usual manner,
the latter part of the line explaining and defining the general
statement contained in the former; and, 2ndly, Pallas kills her enemy,
not by the somewhat roundabout and unusual method of first striking him
with thunder, and then snatching him up in a whirlwind, and then either
dashing him against a sharp rock, and leaving him impaled there, or, as
I have shown is undoubtedly the meaning, impaling him with a sharp rock,
but by the more compendious and less out-of-the-way method of first
striking him with thunder, and then whirling a sharp-pointed rock on top
of him, so as to impale him.

From Milton's imitation of this passage, in his _Paradise Lost_ (ii.
180.), it appears that even he fell into the general and double error:

      "Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled,
      Each on his rock transfixed."

Caro's translation shows that he had no definite idea whatever of the
meaning:

                          "A tale un turbo
      In preda il die; che per acuti scogli
      Miserabil ne fe' rapina, e scempio."

       *       *       *       *       *

      V. "Ast ego, quae Divum incedo regina, Jovisque
         Et soror et conjux, una cum gente tot annos
         Bella gero."--_AEn._ I. 50.

  "'INCEDERE' wird besonders von der feierlichen, wuerdevollen
  Haltung im Gange gebraucht: vers 500, von der Dido, 'Regina
  incessit.' (Ruhnk. zu _Terent. And._ I. i. 100. _Eun._ v. 3. 9.)
  Deshalb der majestaetischen Juno eigenthuemlich, [Greek: Heraion
  badizein]. Also nicht fuer _sum_, sondern ganz
  eigentlich."--_Thiel._

      "But I who walk in awful state above."

      _Dryden._

  "_Incedere_ est _ingredi_, sed proprie cum quadam pompa et
  fastu."--_Gesner._

  "Incessus dearum, imprimis Junonis, gravitate sua
  notus."--_Heyne._

And so also Holdsworth and Ruaeus.

I think, on the contrary, that _incedo_, both here and elsewhere,
expresses only the stepping or walking motion generally, and that the
character of the step or walk, if inferable at all, is to be inferred
only from the context. Accordingly, "Magnifice incedit" (Liv. II. 6.);
"Turpe incedere" (Catull. XXXXII. 8.); "Molliter incedit" (Ovid, _Amor._
II. 23.); "Passu incedit inerti" (Ovid, _Metam._ II. 772.); "Melius est
incessu regem quam imperium regno claudicare" (Justin. VI. ii. 6.);
"Incessus omnibus animalibus certus et uniusmodi, et in suo, cuique,
genere" (Plin. X. 38.).

The emphasis, therefore, is on _regina_, and the meaning is, _I who
step, or walk, QUEEN of the Gods_; the dignity of the step being not
expressed by "incedo," but inferable from "regina." The expression
corresponds exactly to "ibit regina" (_AEn._ II. 578.); with this
difference only, that "ibit" does not, like "incedo," specify motion on
foot.

"Jovisque et soror et conjux."--Both the _ets_ are emphatic. "Jovisque
_et_ soror _et_ conjux."

"Bella" expresses the organised resistance which she meets, and the
uncertainty of the issue; and being placed first word in the line is
emphatic.

Minor Notes.

_Verses presented to General Monck._--The subjoined notice of a curious
entry in the records of the Belfast corporation may be acceptable. The
author is unknown. They are inscribed, "Verses to General Monck," and,
as the last six lines show, are an attack on the Rump Parliament:--

      Advants George Monck, and Monck St. George shall be,
      England's restorer to its liberty,
      Scotland's protector, Ireland's president,
      Reducing all to affree parliament.
      And if thou dost intend the other thing,
      Go on, and all shall cry God save ye king.

        R. R doth rebellion represent,
        V. By V nought else but villainy is meant,
        M. M murther signifies all men doe knowe,
        P. P perjuries in fashion grow.

            Then R and V with M and P
            Conjoined make up our misery.

The occasion of their presentation is unknown. General Monck took
Belfast in 1646 from the Scotch, who being true Presbyterians of the
older school, had turned against the parliament. This was the probable
occasion of their being presented to the future restorer of King Charles
II.

_Justice to Pope Pius V._--You have done yourself credit by exonerating
Queen Elizabeth from a charge the easiest to bring, and the most
difficult to rebut, implying the proof of a negative; and therefore
frequently brought by the unprincipled. I propose, as a counterpart, to
exonerate Pope Pius V. from an imputation, mistakingly, though unjustly,
cast upon him by an authority of no less weight than that of Sir Walter
Scott. In his edition of _Somers's Tracts_, vol. i. p. 192., occurs a
note on a place in the _execution of justice_: "Pius V. resolved to make
his bastard son, Boncompagni, Marquis of Vincola, King of Ireland," &c.
For this assertion no authority is cited, nor indeed could be. The very
name might have suggested the filiation to his successor, Gregory XIII.,
which was the fact. In a work, not much known, _The Burnt Child dreads
the Fire, &c._, by William Denton, M.D., London, 1675, at p. 25. we
read, "Gregory XIII. had a bastard, _James Buon Compagna_, and to him he
gave _Ireland_, and impowered _Stewkely_ with men, arms, and money, to
conquer it for him."[2] There is no reason to doubt, that with the
editor of the _Tracts_ the above imputation was a simple mistake; but it
is an important duty of all who interfere with historical literature, to
state and correct every discovered instance of the kind.

  [Footnote 2: Camden, in his _Elizabeth_, under 1578, states the
  fact without mention of the name, only calling him "the pope's
  bastard;" but the date is the sixth year of the pontificate of
  Gregory XIII.]

Queries.


CROSSES AND CRUCIFIXES.

In the 22nd volume of the _Archaeologia_, p. 58., is the following
passage:

  "The cross, which does not appear to have been peculiar to
  Christianity, when introduced on these obelisks, is usually filled
  with tracery."

The obelisks, or stones of memorial, referred to are the subjects of a
very interesting paper communicated by Mr. Logan to the Society of
Antiquaries. (See Plates 2, 3, 4, and 5.) I am desirous of being
informed what authenticated instances there are of crosses, or stones
marked with crosses, being used for landmarks, memorials, or for any
other purpose, civil or religious, before the introduction of
Christianity? I have met with one instance. Prescott, in his _History of
Mexico_, relates that--

  "In the court of one of the temples in the island of Columel he
  was amazed by the sight of a cross of stone and lime, about ten
  palms high."

It was the emblem of the god of rain (See vol. i. p. 240., &c.)

In the same paper Mr. Logan observes--

  "Crosses, or stones on which the figure was traced, marked a place
  of meeting for certain districts; and within memory of man a fair
  was held on this spot. It is not improbable that market-crosses
  may be deduced from this custom."

It seems that every town that had the privilege of a market or fair (I
am speaking of England) had a market-cross. In most of these towns the
cross has disappeared, and in its place a ball or globe has been mounted
on the shaft; but the term "market-cross" is still in use. In the town
of Giggleswick, in the parish of Giggleswick, there is a perfect
market-cross, the cross being what is, I believe, called a cross-fleury.
In the town of Settle, in the same parish of Giggleswick, the ball or
globe is placed on the top of the shaft. Are there other instances of
market towns in which the cross is still found?

I passed through a market town lately in which the stone steps, and
socket in which the shaft was placed, are preserved; but they have been
removed to one corner of the market-place. The shaft and cross have
disappeared.

Is not this erection of the cross, in places in which markets and fairs
were held, of ecclesiastical origin? Was the cross erected by licence
granted by the bishop within whose jurisdiction it was placed? Is there
any grant of such licence in existence? Or did these crosses originate
in the gratuitous piety of our ancestors? I fear to ask the question,
whether the buyers and sellers under the cross are more upright in their
dealings than those who buy and sell without the presence of this emblem
of all that is true and just. Is the cross erected in the cities and
towns of other states, as in England? Was the custom general in Europe?

    F. W. J.

Mr. Curzon states, in the introduction to his _Monasteries of the
Levant_, that--

  "The crucifix was not known before the fifth or sixth century,
  though the cross was always the emblem of the Christian faith."

I am persuaded that this assertion is incorrect, and that the crucifix
was used in much earlier times. Will some one kindly inform me where the
first mention of it is to be found, and what is the date of the earliest
examples now known?

MASTER OF THE BUCKHOUNDS.

In reading the _Topographer_ for January 1791 (a work which was
published under the editorship of my uncle, Sir Egerton Brydges), I was
surprised to find, in an account of the family of Brocas, of
Beaurepaire, in the county of Hampshire, that the post of Master of the
Buckhounds had been sold in the reign of James I.

Mr. Gough (_Sepulchral Monuments_, pp. 160, 161.) appears to be the
authority quoted who describes the monument of Sir Bernard Brocas, Kt.,
as existing at Westminster, and having on it an inscription in which is
the following sentence:

  "Sir Bernard succeeded to the paternal inheritance both in England
  and France, and having married Mary, daughter and heiress of Sir
  John de Roche, had a large estate with her, and the hereditary
  post of Master of the Buckhounds; which was confirmed to him by
  King Edward the Third, and held by the family, till sold in James
  the First's reign."

I have no means of ascertaining at the present time whether this
monument is still in existence or not; nor indeed has that much to do
with the object of my writing, which is to suggest the following
Queries, in the hope that some of your correspondents may be able to
send satisfactory answers.

1. By whom was the post of Master of the Buckhounds first instituted,
and who was the first Master?

2. Is there any list of persons holding this office; and if so, where
may it be seen?

3. Is there any instance of an unmarried lady having held it: for in the
case before us we see that a lady was able to convey it by inheritance
to her husband?

4. By whom was it sold? Was it by the last hereditary possessor; and if
so, what was his name? Or was it by the king, on the death of one of the
possessors, for the purpose of enriching himself?

5. Is it known whether there is any other instance of its having been
sold: and when did it come to be, as now, a ministerial office?

300. "_No Cross no Crown._"--Where did Penn get the title of his
well-known work? St. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, in allusion to the custom
of crowning crosses, has these lines:--

      "Cerne coronatam Domini super _atria Christi_,
      Stare crucem, duro spondentem celsa labori
      Praemia: _tolle crucem, qui vis auferre coronam_."

      "See how the cross of Christ a crown entwines:
      High o'er God's temple it refulgent shines;
      Pledging bright guerdon for each passing pain:
      Take up the cross, if thou the crown would'st gain."

302. _Pegs and Thongs for Rowing: Torture among the Athenians._--Dr.
Schmitz (in Smith's _Antiq._, article SHIPS) speaks of "the pegs,

were fastened by a thong, [Greek: tropoter]." What is the authority for
two pegs, _between which_, &c? A single peg and thong, as still in
frequent use, would be intelligible!

Dr. Smith observes (ap. id. p. 1139.) that the decree of Scamandrius,
which ordained that no free Athenian should be tortured, "does not
appear to have interdicted torture as a means of execution, _since_ we
find Demosthenes (_de Cor._ 271.) reminding the judges that they had put
Antiphon to death by the rack." Does it not escape him that Antiphon was
_then an alien_, having suffered expulsion from the Lexiarchic list.

        Was the grand-daughter of the
          Great JOHN HAMDEN, Esq.,
          Of St. James's, Westminster."

In the following number (dated 11th September, 1851), the editor offers
an apology for having omitted the date of the decease of Mrs. Mattocks,
viz. 1778; and then remarks that--

  "As she was twenty-seven years old at her death, she must have
  been born in 1751; it was therefore impossible that she should
  have been the grand-daughter of the great John Hampden, that died
  in 1643, one hundred and eight years before her birth."

the subject?

306. _Cicada or Tettigonia Septemdecim._--In Latrobe's _Rambler in North

insect, which visits Pennsylvania every seventeenth year, and appears
about May 24. It is under an inch in length when it first appears early
in the morning, and gains its strength after the sun has risen. These
insects live ten or fifteen days, and never seem to eat any food. They
come in swarms, and birds, pigs, and poultry fatten on them. The female
lays her eggs in the outermost twigs of the forest; these die and drop
on the ground. The eggs give birth to a number of small grubs, which are
thus enabled to attain the mould without injury, and in it they
disappear; they are forgotten till seventeen years pass, and then the
memory of them returns, and they rise from the earth, piercing their way
through the matted sod, the hard trampled clay, &c. They appeared in
1749, &c., to 1834, and are expected in 1851. Has this expectation been
fulfilled?

which three of her sons are mentioned, viz., Owen, Llewellyn, and David.
But there was a _fourth_ son, Roderic, who settled in England, and
appears to have been residing there for some time, when the fatal
rupture occurred between the two countries. It would appear that
descendants of his have lived, and are living in our own times; among
them, the late Dr. John Mawer, of Middleton Tyas, whose remarkable
epitaph was given in a former number of "NOTES AND QUERIES." My first
inquiry is, Is there known to exist any genealogy assuming to extend
between the Rev. and learned gentleman just named and Prince Roderic? I
am told there was one published in the _British Peerage for 1706_, at
which time John Mawer would be three years of age; is such the fact? I
wish also to ask, whether Prince _Owen_ was in existence at the time of
the deaths of Llewellyn and David--whether in Wales or England? and
whether he was the ancestor of Owen Tudor, the proud father of Henry
VII.; and, if not, who _was_ Owen Tudor's ancestor?

  surveillants to throw discredit upon all Jack's reports to the
  heads of the firm; and numbers could attest that those reports

CONVOCATION OF YORK.

(Vol. iv., p. 368.)

This body (of which I am a member) ought to meet on the same occasions
with that of Canterbury; but owing to the neglect or the wilfulness of
its officials, many omissions and mistakes occur. I have heard a
commission to _further_ adjourn the Convocation, from a day to which it
previously stood adjourned, read the day _after_ that on which it ought
to have assembled, but which day had arrived and passed without any one
recollecting the fact! Our Convocation appears at no time to have acted
a very prominent part, though its constitution is far better fitted for
a working synod than that of the southern province. In the latter the
_parochial_ clergy are so inadequately represented as to be much
outnumbered by the _dignitaries_ appointed by the crown and the bishops;
but in York there are _two_ proctors chosen by the clergy of _each_
archdeaconry and peculiar jurisdiction, and _two_ by each cathedral
chapter; thus affording a complete counterpoise to the deans and
archdeacons who are members _ex officio_. Another peculiarity in the
Convocation of York is, that it assembles in _one_ house, the bishops
commonly appearing by their proxies (priests), and the archbishop
presiding by his commissioner, who is always the dean, or one of the
residentiary canons of York.

In 1462 (_temp._ Archbishop Booth) the Convocation of York decreed that
such constitutions of the province of Canterbury as were not prejudicial
to those of York should be received, incorporated, and deemed as their
own (Wilkins's _Concilia_, vol. iii. p. 580.). Under Archbishop
Grenefeld it was decreed that since the Archbishop of York hath no
superior in spirituals except the Pope, no appeals should be suffered to
the Archbishop of Canterbury (p. 663.). At an earlier period the
northern metropolitan laid claim to all England north of the Humber,
with the whole realm of Scotland (Wilkins, vol. i. pp. 325, 479, &c.).
In a provincial council at London, A.D. 1175, his jurisdiction was
denied over the sees of Lincoln, _Chester_, Worcester, and Hereford,
upon which he appealed to the Pope. With the exception of Chester,
however, none of these sees were finally retained in the province.

The next year we are told that, in a (national) council at Westminster,
the Pope's legate presiding, the Archbishop of York, "disdaining to sit
at the left hand of the legate, forced himself into the lap of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, but was immediately _knocked down_ by the
other bishops and clergy, severely beaten, and thrust out of the
council!" (Hoveden ap. Wilkins, vol. i. p. 485.) How far the Northern
Convocation supported their burly prelate in these claims I do not know;
but I _note_ that in those days the disorderly conduct of the clergy was
_not_ made a pretext for the indefinite suspension of synodical
functions; and I _query_ whether the clergy might not be trusted to
behave quite as well in the nineteenth century.

But to return to the Convocation of York. There is a curious letter,
A.D. 1661, from Accepted Frewen, Archbishop of York, to the Convocation,
desiring them to send up to London some of their members duly
commissioned on their part to sit with the Lower House of Canterbury
for the review of the Liturgy. In this letter the archbishop says that
himself and the other bishops of the province were sitting _with the
bishops of the southern province in their House_. A similar expedient
for constituting a _quasi_-national synod seems to have been resorted to
upon some earlier occasions; but the Convocation of York still passed in
due form by their own separate decree what was so agreed upon. The
Articles were thus subscribed by our Convocation in 1571, and the Canons
in 1604 and 1640.

Since then the Convocation of York has been regularly summoned, met,
adjourned, and been prorogued, without even the dutiful address to the
crown, which is regularly discussed and adopted in Canterbury. In the
year 1847, a spasmodic attempt at life was manifested in this venerable
and ill-used institution. Archbishop Harcourt had consented that an
address to the crown should be adopted, and himself procured a draft to
be approved by the bishops. His grace however died before the day of
meeting. Some difficulty was experienced by the officials, both in York
and London, as to the course to be pursued; but a precedent having been
pointed out in the reign of James I., when Archbishop Hutton died after
summoning the Convocation and before its assembly, a writ was issued
from the crown to the dean and chapter at York to elect a _praeses_ for
the Convocation during the vacancy of the archbishoprick. They appointed
the canon who happened to be in residence; an unusually large attendance
was given; the Convocation was opened, the names called over, and then
the officials had reached the limit of their experience; according to
_their_ precedents we ought all to have been sent away. The address
however was called on by the _praeses_, being apparently quite unaware
that a _prolocutor_ should be chosen by the clergy before they proceeded
to business. Such an officer probably seemed to the dignitary already in
the chair like a _second King of Brentford_ "smelling at one rose," and
the demand was refused. Further difficulties ensued, of course, the
moment the debate was opened; and finally, the _praeses_, determined not
to be tempted out of his depth, rose all at once, and read the fatal
_formula_ which restored our glorious Chapter House to its silent
converse with the ghosts. The Convocation has never since been heard of.

THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND.

(Vol. iv., p. 305.)

If your correspondent A. B. R. will refer to Walpole's _Fugitive Pieces_
he will find a minute inquiry into the person and age of this long-lived
lady. This is doubtless the dissertation alluded to by C. (Vol. ii., p.
219.) Pennant has _two_ notices of the countess in his Scotch tours. In
that of 1769 (which somewhat strangely follows the one of 1772), he
gives at p. 87. the engraving spoken of (Vol. iv., p. 306.), apparently
taken from the original at Dupplin Castle. It differs a little from R.'s
description of another portrait, as the cloak is strapped over the
chest, not held by a button. In 1772 Pennant again describes this
portrait in his _Tour in Scotland_, vol. ii. p. 88., and speaks of four
others, viz., first, at Devonshire House; second, at the Hon. John
Yorke's seat, near Cheltenham; third, at Mr. Scott's, printer; and the
fourth, in the Standard Closet, Windsor Castle. At the back of the last
is written with a pen "Rembrandt." "A mistake (says P.) as Rembrandt was
not fourteen years of age (he was indeed only eight) in 1614, at which
time it is certain the countess was not living."

In my copy of the _Fugitive Pieces_ (the Strawberry Hill edition,
presented by Walpole to Cole), I find the following manuscript note by
Cole; _an amplification of the_ passage from Walpole's letters quoted at
p. 306.:--

  "Being at Strawberry Hill in April, 1773, I saw there a copy of
  the picture commonly attributed to the old Countess of Desmond;
  but Mr. Walpole told me that there is sufficient proof that it is
  a painter's mother, I think Rembrandt's. However, by a letter from
  Mr. Lort, April 15, 1774, he assures me that on Mr. Pennant's
  calling at Strawberry Hill to see this picture, he was much
  chagrined at having a print of it engraved for his book, till Mr.
  Lort revived him by carrying him to a garret in Devonshire House,
  where was a picture of this same countess with her name on it,
  exactly corresponding to his engraved print. I remember a
  tolerable good old picture of her at Mr. Dicey's, prebendary of
  Bristol, at Walton in Bucks."

Walpole could not dismiss Pennant without a disparaging remark. He is "a
superficial man, and knows little of history or antiquity; but he has a
violent rage for being an author." Those who live in glass houses should
not throw stones: Pennant would not have displayed the ignorance which
Walpole exhibits in the instance before us. In an inscription, which the
latter gives, on a Countess of Desmond buried at Sligo, occurs the
following contraction: "Desmoniae _Noie_ Elizabetha." Walpole says
(_Fugitive Pieces_, p. 204.), "This word I can make no sense of, but
_sic originale_; I take it to be redundancy of the carver. It seems to
be a repetition of the last three syllables of Desmoniae!"

The sarcastic observations which Walpole passes on the Society of
Antiquaries, its members, and its publications, are so frequent and so
bitter, that they must have been founded on some offence not to be
pardoned. Were the remarks on the "Historic Doubts" by the president,
Dean Milles, and by the Rev. Robert Masters (printed in the first two
volumes of the _Archaeologia_), regarded as satisfactorily confuting
Walpole's arguments; or did he aim, but unsuccessfully, at the
president's chair?

COINS OF VABALATHUS.

(Vol. iv., p. 255.)

There have been many attempts to explain the puzzling VCRIMDR, on the
supposition that a Latin sentence was concealed under these letters.
Pinkerton suggested "Voluntate Caesaris Romani Imperatoris Maximi Domini,
Rex." I hope to offer a better solution, which, although not new, has
been passed over, I believe, by all subsequent writers. The Rev. George
North, in the _Museum Meadianum_, p. 97., gives the following note:
"Apud Arabes accepi verbum Karama significare Honoravit, a quo Ucrima,
et Ucrim; quo sensu respondet hoc Arabicum [Greek: To Sebasto] apud
Graecos." On applying to a well-known scholar and linguist here, I found
that from the verb _Karama_ there was derived the adjective _Kar[=i]mat_
(nobilis), from which again the superlative _Akram_ comes. There can, I
think, be little doubt that the word VCRIMDR is originally derived from
this verb _Karama_, and that it is most probably equivalent to
_Nobilissimus_, a title so common shortly afterwards, as applied to the
heirs to the empire.[3]

  [Footnote 3: "_Nobilissimus_, in the Byzantine historians, is
  synonymous with Caesar."--_Niebuhr._]

The word [Greek: SROIAS] or [Greek: SRIAS], which appears on the
Alexandrian coins of this prince, is of more difficult explanation. Some
think it a praenomen, some a Syriac or other Eastern title, perhaps
corresponding to VCRIMDR. Pellerin thought so. I hope some Oriental
scholar will direct his attention to this point. These coins are very
often ill struck, so that the part of the legend below the head, where
the word in question is found, is indistinct, for which reason I suppose
MR. TAYLOR has followed the erroneous reading of Banduri, [Greek:
HERMIAS] (properly [Greek: HERMIAS], with lunate epsilon) for [Greek:
SROIAS], which has been corrected by Eckhel. Of three specimens which I
possess, one only reads clearly [Greek: SROIAS], from the
above-mentioned cause, but it is unquestionably the correct reading on
all. The best arrangement of the legend, from analogy with those forms
used by the Romans, is as follows:

      [Greek: AUTokrator . SROIAS . OUABALLATHOS . ATHENOdorou . Huios.]

The existence of coins, of which I possess a specimen also, reading

      [Greek: A . SRIAS . OUABALLATHOS . ATHEN . U.]

shows that we must not read [Greek: ATHENOU] as one word, but must
divide it as above. I think MR. TAYLOR will find his specimen to read as
the last-mentioned coin, the [Greek: ER] (properly [Greek: ER]) being
[Greek: SR], and the [Greek: AU] in like manner [Greek: AS]. My coin
gives the whole legend distinctly, and I can vouch for the exactitude of
the above legend.

I believe there appeared some years ago, in the _Revue de Numismatique_,
an article on the coins of the Zenobian family, but I do not remember
when it was published, nor the conclusions to which the writer came.
That is, however, the most recent investigation of the subject, and to
it I must refer MR. TAYLOR, as I have not access to that periodical
here.

Sir Gardner Wilkinson has published in the _Numismatic Chronicle_, vol.
vii. or viii., an inscription containing the names of Zenobia and
Vabalathus. After the name of Vabalathus, who has the title of
Autocrator, is the word [Greek: ATHENODOROU], which justifies the
reading [Greek: Athenodorou Huios] on the coins. Vabalathus is thus
probably the son of Zenobia by a former husband, Athenodorus, while
bearing himself the same name, as Vabalathus (better Vaballathus, as on
the Alexandrian coins) is said to be equivalent to Athenodorus, Gift of
Pallas.

MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS.

(Vol. iv., pp. 57, 125, 193, 196, 298.)

I entirely agree with you that your pages are not a fit battle-ground
for theological controversy. Still, since the question of the
translation of Heb. xiii. 4. has been mooted, I beg with much deference
to suggest that it will not be quite right to let it fall to the ground
unsettled, especially since CEPHAS has thought fit to charge those of
our Reformers who translated the Scriptures with mistranslating
advisedly, and with propagating new doctrines.

CEPHAS'S version of the passage is right, and our English version is
wrong; but the fault lies in the ignorance of our translators, an
ignorance which they shared with all the scholars of their day, and many
not bad scholars of our own, of the effect produced on the force of the
article by the relation in which it stands to the other words in the
clause, in point of order. [Greek: ho timios gamos] is "the honourable
marriage;" [Greek: ho timios gamos esti] is "the honourable marriage
is;" [Greek: ho gamos timios] is untranslateable, unless you supply
[Greek: esti], and then it means "the marriage" (or, marriage in
general, in the abstract) "is honourable." But [Greek: esto] might be
supplied, as it is in Heb. xiii. 4., when it will mean, "let marriage be
honourable:" and [Greek: timios ho gamos] has just the same meaning,
with perhaps this difference, that the emphasis falls more distinctly on
[Greek: timios]. The circumstance that the mere assertion that marriage
is honourable in all (men or things), true as it is in itself, ill
accords with the tenor of the passage of which it forms a part, which is
hortatory, not assertive, is a good reason why CEPHAS'S version should
be preferred. But when we find afterwards the words [Greek: kai he koite
amiantos], it is impossible to deny this hortatory force to the
sentence; for those words cannot mean "the undefiled bed:" and to
translate them "the (or their) bed is undefiled"--which is the only
version which they will here bear, but one--would give but a feeble
sense. That sole remaining sense is, "the bed (let it) be undefiled;"
subaudite [Greek: esto] in the verse is, "Let marriage be honourable in
all" (men or things), "and the bed be undefiled; but (or for)
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge." Had our translators known
that [Greek: he koite amiantos] could not mean "the bed undefiled," they
would at once have been driven to see that the verse is a commandment:
and the commandment that marriage should be held honourable in all men
(or in all respects), would have served the purpose of their doctrines
quite as well as the affirmative form which they have given to their
present version. I say, it would have served their purpose; but I say
more: they heeded not what did or would serve their purpose. They looked
only for the truth and disregarded all else in their pursuit of it. With
regard to the controversy about [Greek: en pasi], it is immaterial which
version be adopted. MR. WALTER is right in the rule which he enunciates,
if he means that in those cases of adjectives in which the masculine and
neuter forms are the same, "man" or "men," not "thing" or "things," must
be understood: but it is not always observed, even in classical writers,
either in Latin or in Greek. There is no reason why it should be broken
here; and I do not believe it is broken. It must have been only by a
slip of CEPHAS'S pen that he called [Greek: pasi] a feminine adjective.
It undoubtedly refers to both sexes. I wish E. A. D. had given the Greek
of the passages from Chrysostom and Augustine, of which he has
communicated the Oxford translation, which is as likely to err, perhaps,
as any other. Jerome's Latin, like the Vulgate, though the words are not
precisely the same, gives a literal version of the Greek, without
supplying any verb at all, either _est_ or _sit_, and, since the Latin
has not that expressive power in cases like this which the article gives
to the Greek, leaves the passage obscure and undecided.

Replies to Minor Queries.

_"Crowns have their Compass," &c._ (Vol. iv., p. 294.).--The lines
alluded to by your correspondent MR. ABSALON form a inscription on a
portrait of King James I. in the Cracherode Collection. (Vide Beloe's
_Anecdotes_, vol. i. p. 210.)

      "Crownes have their compasse, length of dayes their date,
      Triumphes their tombes, felicitie her fate;
      Of more than earth can earth make none partaker,
      But knowledge makes the king most like his Maker."

I am aware that this reference does not go to the "root of the matter,"
if MR. ABSALON wishes to ascertain the author's name; but it may serve
as a clue to further discovery.

It is quite obvious what lines your correspondent alludes to, though the
above quotation which he gives as the commencement of them is not quite
correct, nor were they written with the object he supposes.

I send a correct copy of them below, taken from Mr. Payne Collier's very
interesting _Life of Shakspeare_, to whom they have always been
attributed; and, it is said, with every show of reason. It is supposed
they were written by him in the shape of a complimentary allusion to
King James I., in grateful acknowledgment of the patronage bestowed by
that monarch upon the stage. The subject is fully discussed at pp. 202,
203. of Mr. Knight's volume, whence, indeed, the above information is
derived; and he publishes the lines, as follows, stating then to be
copied from a coeval manuscript in his possession:--

      "SHAKSPEARE ON THE KING.

      "Crowns have their compass--length of days their date--
      Triumphs their tomb--felicity, her fate--
      Of nought but earth can earth make us partaker,
      But knowledge makes a king most like his Maker."

Some one, to make the allusion more complete, that is, to over-do it,
changed "_a_ king" into "_the_ king" in a subsequent publication of the
lines. But this, as Mr. Payne Collier very justly feels, completely
spoils the whole complexion of the epigram, and perverts a fine allusion
into a raw personality.

_The Rev. Richard Farmer_ (Vol. iv., pp. 379.[4] 407.).--The
observations of BOLTON CORNEY upon my incidental mention of Dr. Farmer,
are, I think, wholly unwarranted, both in substance and manner,
especially as he himself furnishes ample confirmation of its truth.

  [Footnote 4: At page 379., second column, fifth line from bottom,
  for "thrice" read "twice."]

Taking his quotations in due order--

1. The certificate of Dr. Farmer's character for learning and ability is
unnecessary, because neither was impugned; nor does an allegation of
atrocity in taste and judgment necessarily imply deficiency in mere
book-learning.

2. As for Isaac Reed's opinion in favour of Farmer's Essay, it might be
met by many of directly opposite tendency, and of at least equal weight.

3. In the only point really in question, BOLTON CORNEY "cannot deny that
Farmer related the anecdote of the _wool-man_" (that being the reputed
trade of Shakspeare's father); but to what end was it related, if not
to suggest an application of which Steevens was only the interpreter?

But BOLTON CORNEY thinks the character of the witness suspicious; he
forgets that only just before he had stated that the anecdote and its
application had been repeated in three editions, extending over thirteen
years, all within the lifetime of Dr. Farmer!

of those celebrated lexicographers--or else we must consider his

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Although there are few books which have proved of greater utility to
inquirers into the more recent history of England than Beatson's
_Political Index_, yet it is also true that there are few which have
more frequently or more justly caused the reader to feel the want of a
new and improved edition. A very short examination, however, of Mr.
Haydn's recently published Beatson's _Political Index Modernised, The
Book of Dignities, containing Rolls of the Official Personages of the
British Empire, Civil, Ecclesiastical, Judicial, Military, Naval, and
Municipal, &c._, will satisfy the reader that such want has at length
been supplied in a manner the most ample and the most satisfactory. For
though we have referred to Beatson's well-known work for the purpose of
furnishing a better idea of the _Book of Dignities_, we are bound to
acknowledge that Mr. Haydn is justified in stating, that in the work in
question he owes little more than the plan to Beatson. Mr. Haydn's
volume not only contains many lists (among them the "Administrations of
England, and the Judges of the Ecclesiastical Courts") not to be found
in the _Political Index_, but the author has had the advantage of being
permitted to search the various official records with the view of
enabling him to give complete and accurate information. The result, of
course, is obvious; namely, that just in the same proportion that our
author surpasses Beatson in the extent and accuracy of his various
lists, does the _Book of Dignities_ exceed its predecessor in usefulness
to the official man, the historian, and the scholar.

Mr. Hunt's experience as a public lecturer at the various literary and
scientific institutions of the country, having convinced him that for
the majority of the members of those institutions most of the existing
works on natural philosophy are of too abstruse and technical a
character--are, in short, sealed books,--he has been led to publish a
small volume which we have no doubt will soon become extremely popular.
It is entitled _Elementary Physics, an Introduction to the Study of
Natural Philosophy_; and, as its object is to teach physical science so
far as to render all the great deductions from observation and
experiment satisfactorily clear, without encountering the difficulty of
mathematics,--and no one is better able to do this, and throw a charm
over such a subject, than the author of the _Poetry of Science_,--the
work, which is illustrated with upwards of two hundred woodcuts, will be
found eminently useful; not only to those who have neither time nor
opportunity to carry their studies beyond its pages, but especially as a
"first book" to those in whom it may awaken the desire for a more
perfect knowledge of the beautiful and important truths of which it
treats.

The nature of the _Hand Atlas of Physical Geography, consisting of a
Series of Maps and Illustrations, showing the Geographical Distribution
of Natural Phenomena, embracing the Divisions of Geology, Hydrography,
Meteorology, Natural History: from the Physikalischer Atlas of Berghaus,
and the Maps of the Erdkunde, drawn by and under the immediate
Superintendence of Drs. Ritter and Kiepert, Oetzel, Grimm, &c., by the
Editor of the University Atlas of the Middle Ages_, is sufficiently
described by its ample title-page; which shows, moreover, that the work
is not a mere copy or reduction of the great atlas of Berghaus, on which
it is founded. As a companion to the works of Humboldt, Mrs. Somerville,
and other writers on physical geography, it will be found most useful;
while its convenient size, and moderate price, place it within the reach
of almost all classes of readers.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
