  THE COCK, THE MOUSE

  AND THE LITTLE RED HEN




  Once upon a time there was
  a hill, and on the hill there
  was a pretty little house.

    It had one little green
  door, and four little windows
  with green shutters,
  and in it there lived

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  A Cock

  [Illustration]

  and A Mouse

    and
      A Little
        Red
          Hen

  [Illustration]

  On another hill close by
  there was another little
  house. It was very ugly.

  [Illustration]

    It had a door
  that wouldn't shut,

  [Illustration]

  and two broken windows,
  and all the paint
  was off the shutters

  And in this house
  there lived

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  A BOLD BAD FOX
    and FOUR BAD
    LITTLE FOXES

  [Illustration]

    One morning these
  four bad little foxes

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    came to the
      big bad Fox
        and said:

    "Oh, Father, we're so
  hungry!"

    "We had nothing to eat
  yesterday," said one.

    "And scarcely anything
  the day before," said another.

    "And only half a chicken
  the day before that," said
  the third.

    "And only two little
  ducks the day before that,"
  said the fourth.

  [Illustration]

    The big bad Fox shook
  his head for a long time,
  for he was thinking.

  [Illustration]

    At last he said in a
      big gruff voice:

    "On that hill over there
  I see a house. And in that
  house there lives a Cock."

    "And a Mouse," screamed
  two of the little foxes.

  [Illustration]

    "And a little Red Hen,"
  screamed the other two.

    "And they are nice and fat,"
  went on the big bad Fox.
  "This very day, I'll take my
  great sack, and I will go up
  that hill, and in at that door,
  and into my sack I will put
  the Cock, and the Mouse,
  and the little Red Hen."

  [Illustration]

    "I'll make a fire
      to roast the Cock,"
        said one little fox.

  "I'll put on the saucepan
  to boil the Hen,"
  said the second.

  [Illustration]

  "And I'll get the frying
  pan to fry the Mouse,"
  said the third.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  "And I'll have the biggest
  helping when
  they are all cooked,"
  said the fourth, who
  was the greediest of all.

  So the four little foxes
  jumped for joy, and the
  big bad Fox went to get
  his sack ready to start
  upon his journey.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  But what was happening
  to the Cock and the Mouse,
  and the little Red Hen, all
  this time?

  [Illustration]

    Well, sad to say, the Cock and
  the Mouse had both got out of
  bed on the wrong side that
  morning.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    The Cock said the day was
  too hot, and the Mouse grumbled
  because it was too cold.

    They came grumbling down
  to the kitchen, where the good
  little Red Hen, looking as bright
  as a sunbeam, was bustling about.

    "Who'll get some sticks to
  light the fire with?" she asked.

    "_I_ shan't," said the Cock.

    "_I_ shan't," said the Mouse.

    "Then I'll do it myself," said
  the little Red Hen.

    So off she ran to get the sticks.

  [Illustration]

  "And now, who'll fill
  the kettle from the
  spring?" she asked.

  [Illustration]

  "_I_ shan't,"
  said the Cock.

  "_I_ shan't," said
  the Mouse.

  [Illustration]

  "Then I'll do it myself,"
  said the little Red Hen.
  And off she ran to
  fill the kettle.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  "And who'll get the
  breakfast ready?" she
  asked, as she put the
  kettle on to boil.

  [Illustration]

  "_I_ shan't,"
  said the Cock.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  "_I_ shan't,"
  said the Mouse.

  "I'll do it myself,"
  said the little Red Hen.

  [Illustration]

    All breakfast time the
  Cock and the Mouse quarrelled
  and grumbled. The
  Cock upset the milk jug,
  and the Mouse scattered
  crumbs upon the floor

  [Illustration]

    "Who'll clear away the
  breakfast?" asked the poor
  little Red Hen, hoping

  [Illustration]

  they would soon leave
  off being cross.

    "_I_ shan't," said the Cock.

    "_I_ shan't," said the Mouse.

    "Then I'll do it myself,"
  said the little Red Hen.

    So she cleared everything
  away, swept up the crumbs,
  and brushed up the fireplace.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    "And now, who'll help
  me to make the beds?"

  "_I_ shan't," said the Cock.

  "_I_ shan't," said the Mouse.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    "Then I'll do it myself,"
  said the little Red Hen.

    And she tripped away
  upstairs.

    But the lazy Cock and
  Mouse each sat down in a
  comfortable arm-chair by
  the fire

  [Illustration]

  and soon fell
  fast asleep.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    Now the bad Fox had
  crept up the hill, and into
  the garden, and if the Cock
  and Mouse hadn't been
  asleep, they would have seen
  his sharp eyes peeping in
  at the window.

  "Rat tat tat, Rat tat tat",
  the Fox knocked at the door.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    "Who can that be?" said the
  Mouse, half opening his eyes.

    "Go and look for yourself, if
  you want to know," said the
  rude Cock

  [Illustration]

    "It's the postman perhaps,"
  thought the Mouse to himself,
  "and he may have a letter
  for me." So without waiting to
  see who it was, he lifted the
  latch and opened the door.

  As soon as he opened it
  in jumped the big Fox, with
  a cruel smile upon his face!

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  "Oh! oh! oh!" squeaked the
  Mouse as he tried to run up
  the chimney.

  "Doodle doodle do!" screamed
  the Cock, as he jumped on the
  back of the biggest
  arm-chair

  But the Fox only laughed,
  and without more ado he
  took the little Mouse by the
  tail, and popped him into
  the sack, and seized the
  Cock by the neck and popped
  him in too.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  Then the poor little Red
  Hen came running down-stairs
  to see what all the
  noise was about,
  and the Fox caught her
  and put her into the sack
  with the others.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  Then he took a long piece of
  string out of his pocket, wound
  it round and round and
  round the mouth of
  the sack, and tied it very
  tight indeed.

  [Illustration]

  After that he threw the sack
  over his back and set off down
  the hill.

  [Illustration]

    "Oh! I wish I hadn't been
  so cross," said the Cock, as
  they went bumping about.

    "Oh! I wish I hadn't been
  so lazy," said the Mouse, wiping
  his eyes with the tip of his tail.

    "It's never too late to mend,"
  said the little Red Hen. "And
  don't be too sad.

  [Illustration]

    See, here I have my little
  work-bag, and in it there is
  a pair of scissors, and a
  little thimble, and a needle
  and thread. Very soon you
  will see what I am going
  to do."

  Now the sun was very hot,
  and soon Mr. Fox began to
  feel his sack was heavy,
  and at last he thought he
  would lie down under a
  tree and go to sleep for
  a little while.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  So he threw the sack down
  with a big bump, and very
  soon fell fast asleep.

    Snore, snore, snore, went
  the Fox.

  [Illustration]

  As soon as the little Red
  Hen heard this, she took
  out her scissors, and began
  to snip a hole in the sack,
  just large enough for the
  Mouse to creep through.

  "Quick," she whispered to
  the Mouse, "run as fast as you
  can and bring back a stone
  just as large as yourself."

  [Illustration]

  Out scampered the Mouse,
  and soon came back, dragging
  the stone after him.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    "Push it in here," said
  the little Red Hen, and he
  pushed it in in a twinkling.

    Then the little Red Hen
  snipped away the hole, till
  it was large enough for the
  Cock to get through.

    "Quick," she said, "run
  and get a stone as big as
  yourself."

  [Illustration]

    Out flew the Cock, and
  soon came back quite out
  of breath, with a big stone,
  which he pushed into the
  sack too.

  [Illustration]

  Then the little Red Hen
  popped out,

  [Illustration]

    got a stone as big as
  herself, and pushed it in.

  Next she put on her thimble,
  took out her needle and thread,
  and sewed up the hole as
  quickly as ever she could.

  [Illustration]

  When it was done, the
  Cock and the Mouse and
  the little Red Hen ran home
  very fast, shut the door

  [Illustration]

  after them, drew the bolts,
  shut the shutters, and drew
  down the blinds and felt
  quite safe.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    The bad Fox lay fast asleep
  under the tree for some time,
  but at last he woke up.

    "Dear, dear," he said, rubbing
  his eyes and then looking at
  the long shadows on the grass,
  "how late it is getting. I must
  hurry home."

  So the bad Fox went
  grumbling and groaning
  down the hill

  [Illustration]

  till he came to the
  stream.

  Splash! In went one foot.
  Splash! In went the other,
  but the stones in the sack
  were so heavy that at the
  very next step down tumbled
  Mr. Fox into a deep pool.

  [Illustration]

    And then the fishes carried
  him off to their fairy caves
  and kept him a prisoner there,
  so he was never seen again.

  [Illustration]

    And the four greedy
  little foxes had to go
  to bed without any
  supper.

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

    But the Cock and the
  Mouse never grumbled
  again. They lit the fire,
  filled the kettle, laid the
  breakfast, and did all the
  work, while the good little
  Red Hen had a holiday, and
  sat resting in the big arm-chair.

    No foxes ever troubled
  them again, and for all I
  know they are still living
  happily in the little house
  with the green door and
  green shutters, which stands
  on the hill.

The Cock, the Mouse and the little Red Hen


Once upon a time there was a hill, and on the hill there was a
pretty little house. It had one little green door, and four little
windows with green shutters, and in it there lived a Cock and a
Mouse and a Little Red Hen[.]

On another hill close by there was another little house. It was very
ugly. It had a door that wouldn't shut, and two broken windows, and
all the paint was off the shutters[.] And in this house there lived
a Bold Bad Fox and Four Bad Little Foxes[.]

One morning these four bad little foxes came to the big bad Fox and
said:

"Oh, Father, we're so hungry!"

"We had nothing to eat yesterday," said one.

"And scarcely anything the day before," said another.

"And only half a chicken the day before that," said the third.

"And only two little ducks the day before that," said the fourth.

"Then I'll do it myself," said the little Red Hen. So she cleared

"And now, who'll help me to make the beds?"

"_I_ shan't," said the Cock.

"_I_ shan't," said the Mouse.

"Then I'll do it myself," said the little Red Hen. And she tripped
away upstairs. But the lazy Cock and Mouse each sat down in a
comfortable arm-chair by the fire and soon fell fast asleep.

Now the bad Fox had crept up the hill, and into the garden, and if
the Cock and Mouse hadn't been asleep, they would have seen his

Fox knocked at the door.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
