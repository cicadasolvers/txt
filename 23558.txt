   It seems to me, the more I think of it, that the true life of anyone
   is not the one they live in themselves, and of which they are
   themselves conscious, but the life they live in the hearts of others.
   Our bodies and brains are but the tools with which we work to make our
   true life, which is not in the tool-box and tools we ignorantly
   mistake for ourselves, but in the work we do with them; and this work,
   if it be truly done, lives more in others than in ourselves.

S. BUTLER, 1895.

Preface


The Butler Collection was not all given to St. John's at once.  I sent up
some pictures and some books in 1917; and at intervals I have sent more,
always keeping a list of what has gone.  Now that I have no more to send
seems the proper time for a Catalogue to be issued, and it is made from
the lists which I kept, and which were in part printed in _The Eagle_,
put in order by A. T. Bartholomew and annotated by myself.  I am
responsible for the notes and am the person intended when "I" and "me"
occur.  Bartholomew is responsible for the classification, for verifying,
for checking, and for the bibliographical part.

In time the collection will no doubt increase as new editions or
translations of Butler's books appear and as further books are published
referring to him.  All such I intend to include in the collection; and I
hope that other Butlerians will see fit to make additions to it.

I think that the notes give all necessary explanations; but I may perhaps
say here that many of the pictures were made before Butler contemplated
writing such a book as _Alps and Sanctuaries_.  When he was preparing
that book he went to the places therein described and made on the spot
many black and white drawings for reproduction; but he found that this
method would take too long, so he made others of the black and white
drawings from oil and water-colour sketches which he had done previously,
and this is why some of the pictures are dated many years before the book
was published.

Among the books, under _Alps and Sanctuaries_ (p. 18), is Streatfeild's
copy of that work; and under _The Way of All Flesh_ (p. 21) is his copy
of that book.  Both these copies are said to have been "purchased."  I
bought them from the dealer to whom Streatfeild sold them when his health
broke down and he moved from his rooms.  I have no doubt that he would
have given them to me if I had asked for them, but he was not in a
condition to be troubled about business.

St. John's College has contributed 30 pounds towards the expenses of
printing and publishing this catalogue.  I offer them my most cordial
thanks for their generosity.  I am also deeply indebted to them for
finding space in which to house the collection.  I shrank from the
responsibility of keeping it myself.  I remembered also that an
individual dies; even a family may become extinct; but St. John's
College, we hope, will enjoy as near an approach to immortality as can be
attained on this transient globe.  I am sure that Butler would be pleased
if he could know that during that period this collection will be
preserved and will be accessible to all who wish to visit it.

SAMUEL BUTLER.  ABOUT 1866 . . . _Frontispiece_

From a photograph taken by his sister, Mrs. Bridges, in the garden at
Langar soon after his return from New Zealand.

FACSIMILE OF POST-CARD FROM S. BUTLER TO H. F. JONES, FLORENCE, SEPT. 3,
1892 . . . _face p._ 23

Butler was staying in Florence on his way home from his first visit to
Sicily.  The old Greek painting referred to is reproduced as the
frontispiece to _The Authoress of the Odyssey_ (1897).  Mlle. V. is Mlle.
Vaillant, as to whom see _the Memoir_.  The "nose" belonged to the editor
of a Swiss paper whom I had met at Fusio.

SAMUEL BUTLER WHEN AN UNDERGRADUATE AT CAMBRIDGE.  ABOUT 1858 . . . _face
p._ 52

This is taken from a photographic group of Butler and three friends.  The
friends are omitted, as I have failed to identify them.




I.  PICTURES, SKETCHES AND DRAWINGS
BY OR RELATING TO SAMUEL BUTLER


By his will Butler bequeathed his pictures, sketches, and studies to his
executors to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as they might think
best, the proceeds (if any) to fall into residue.  They were not sold:
some were given to Shrewsbury School; some to the British Museum; one, an
unfinished sketch of the back of the house in which Keats died on the
Piazza di Spagna, Rome, to the Keats and Shelley Memorial there; many
were distributed among his friends, Alfred Cathie taking fifteen and I
taking all that were left over.  Alfred lives in Canal Road, Mile End,
and, this being on the route of the German air-raids, he was anxious to
put his pictures in a place of safety.  Accordingly it was arranged
between us in 1917 that I should buy them from him.  When he heard that I
was giving them to St. John's, he desired that I should not buy all,
because he wished to give two of them himself to the College.
Accordingly, I bought only thirteen, and the remaining two, viz. no. 28,
Leatherhead Church, and no. 59, Chiavenna, 1887, were given to St. John's
College by Alfred.

There are but few sketches or pictures by Butler between 1888 and 1896.
This is because his sketching was interrupted by his having to take up
photography for the preparation of _Ex Voto_.  Almost before this book
was published (1888) he had plunged into _The Life and Letters of Dr.
Butler_, and in 1892 he added to his absorbing occupations the problem of
the _Odyssey_.  Thus he had little leisure or energy for the labour of
painting; and this labour was always great.  He could not leave his
outline until he had got it right, and there was a perpetual chase after
the changing shadows.  And when he had got the outline it was so
constantly disappearing under the colour that he took to making "a
careful outline on a separate sheet of paper"; this was to be kept, after
he had traced the drawing on to the paper which was to receive the
colour, and to be referred to continually while he proceeded.  When he
met with the camera lucida, which he bought in Paris, and which is among
the objects given to St. John's, he thought his difficulties were solved
and wrote to Miss Savage, 9 October, 1882: "I have got a new toy, a
camera lucida, which does all the drawing for me, and am so pleased with
it that I am wanting to use it continually."  To which in 1901 he added
this note: "What a lot of time I wasted over that camera lucida, to be
sure!"  It did all the drawing for him, but it distorted the perspective
so that the outlines of the many sketches which he produced with its help
were a disappointment.

The camera lucida having failed, his hopes were next fixed upon
photography, which, by rapidly and correctly recording anything he felt a
desire to sketch, was to give him something from which he could
afterwards construct a picture.  So he took an immense number of snap-
shots, of which many are at St. John's, but he never did anything with
them.  Nos. 62 and 63, which were done by Sadler from Butler's
photographs, show how he would have proceeded if he had not had too many
other things to do.

It was not until 1896, when _The Life of Dr. Butler_ appeared, that he
was able to return seriously to sketching, and by that time he was over
sixty and too old to be burdened with the paraphernalia necessary for
oils; he therefore confined himself to water-colours.

Some of the pictures in this list were included in the list in _The
Eagle_, vol. xxxix., no. 175, March 1918, and the remainder in the
succeeding number, June 1918.  In making the present catalogue I have
corrected such errors and misprints as I noticed in _The Eagle_, and I
have re-arranged and renumbered the items so as to make them run in
chronological order.  I have also amplified some of the notes.  I have
placed the sketches and drawings in order of date because to examine them
in that order helps the spectator to realise the progress made by Butler
in his artistic studies.



SAMUEL BUTLER


1.  Black and white outline sketch: Civita Vecchia, 1854.

Butler went abroad with his family, his second visit to Italy, for the
winter of 1853-4.  They travelled through Switzerland to Rome and Naples,
starting in August 1853, and Butler thus missed the half-year at school.
I am sorry that I have not found any more finished drawing made by him on
this occasion.



DOUGLAS YEOMAN BLAKISTON


2.  Pencil drawing: Samuel Butler, 1854.

Reproduced in the _Memoir_, ch. iii.  On the back of this drawing is the
beginning of a water-colour sketch.  It was in a book with others
mentioned in the _Memoir_ as having been given to Shrewsbury School (I.
44).  I have no doubt that the sketch on the back is by Butler, and
represents part of the Rectory house at Langar.

The Rev. D. Y. Blakiston was born in 1832.  He studied art at the Royal
Academy Schools especially under W. Dobson, R.A.  From about 1850 to 1865
he painted in London and at St. Leonard's, and exhibited at the Royal
Academy.  About 1865 he entered at Downing College, took Orders in 1869,
and was presented to the living of East Grinstead in 1871, which he held
till his retirement soon after 1908.  He died in 1914.  Throughout his
life he made a practise of sketching his friends.  I suppose he must have
met and sketched Butler on some occasion when Butler was in London
staying with his cousins the Worsleys.  The artist's son, the Rev. H. E.
D. Blakiston, when President of Trinity College, Oxford, gave me a
cutting from _The East Grinstead Observer_ containing a full obituary of
him.  It is among the papers at St. John's College, and is referred to in
the Postscript to the Preface to my _Memoir_ of Butler.



HENRY FESTING JONES


3.  My first attempt at a drawing in pencil and ink of Butler's
Homestead, Mesopotamia, New Zealand.

I did it in 1910 or thereabouts from a faded photograph taken about 1863
and lent to Butler by J. D. Enys.  _Also_ Emery Walker's reproduction of
my first attempt which was not used in the _Memoir_.

4.  My second attempt, which was reproduced in the _Memoir_.



SAMUEL BUTLER


5.  Water-colour: A view in Cambridge.

Probably done when Butler was an undergraduate, and given to St. John's
some years ago.  I found it in the book wherein I found Blakiston's
drawing (no. 2).

6.  Oil Painting: Family Prayers.

On the ceiling he wrote "I did this in 1864, and if I had gone on doing
things out of my own head instead of making studies I should have been
all right."  (_Memoir_, I. 115.)  Reproduced in the _Memoir_, ch. xxiv.,
and referred to, ch. viii.

7.  Oil Painting: His own head.

"He painted at home as well as at Heatherley's, and by way of a cheap
model hung up a looking-glass near the window of his painting room and
made many studies of his own head.  He gave some of them away and
destroyed and painted over others, but after his death we found a number
in his rooms--some of the earlier ones very curious" (_Memoir_, ch.
viii.).  This is one of the earlier ones.  It is inscribed, "S.B., Feb.
18, 1865."  We found also a still more curious one which was given to
Gogin, who was interested in it as being the work of an untaught student.
See also no. 36.



JOHN LEECH


8.  Five pencil drawings on one card.

John Leech died in 1864, the year in which Butler returned from New
Zealand.  There was a sale of his drawings by his sisters, and I remember
going to see them as a boy, but I do not remember when; it was, no doubt,
soon after the artist's death.  The house was in Radnor Place, Bayswater.
His sisters afterwards kept a small girls' school, and my sister Lilian
went there.  I have placed these Leech drawings here in order of date on
the assumption that Butler bought them at the sale.  He had another
drawing by Leech, which used to hang in his chambers, and was given to
his cousin, Reginald Worsley.



SAMUEL BUTLER


9.  Oil Painting: Interior of Butler's sitting-room, 15, Clifford's Inn.

There is something written in pencil on the panelling in the left-hand
bottom corner.  I believe the words to be "Corner of my room, Augt. 1865,
S.B."  Reproduced in the _Memoir_, ch. xv.

Here are shown Butler's books, including Bradshaw's Guide and Whitaker's
Almanack, of which he speaks somewhere as being indispensable.  I admit
that I cannot identify them, but he used to keep them among the books in
these shelves.  I do not think he ever possessed that equally
indispensable book the Post Office Directory.  But he had more books than
those shown in this painting.  Between his sitting-room and his painting-
room was a short passage in which was a cupboard, and this contained the
rest.  I do not remember how many there were, but not enough to
invalidate the statement he made to Robert Bridges (_Memoir_ II. 320), "I
have, I verily believe, the smallest library of any man in London who is
by way of being literary."

10.  Water-colour: Dieppe, The Castle, 1866.

Butler was at Dieppe with Pauli in 1866.  (_Memoir_, ch. viii.)

11.  Small water-colour drawing: Dieppe, 1866.

This is in the portfolio of miscellaneous drawings, etc., by Butler,
Gogin, and Sadler, no. 81.

12.  Oil Painting: Two heads done as a study at Heatherley's.

I showed this to Gaetano Meo, and he remembered that the man was
Calorossi, a model, whose brother went to Paris and became known as the
proprietor of a studio there.  The woman, he said, was Maria, another
model.  The background is Dieppe.  I suppose that Butler did this study
in the autumn of 1866, using nos. 10 and 11, the water-colours of Dieppe,
or some other sketch made on the spot, for the background.  The idea was
to make portraits of two heads with a landscape background in the manner
of Giovanni Bellini.

13.  Drawing of a cast of the Antinous as Hermes.

Inscribed "Samuel Butler for probationership, December 28th 1868."  Done,
I suppose, at South Kensington.

14.  Drawing of a hand and foot.

Probably also done at South Kensington.

15.  Black and white drawing of a fir tree.

This, I suspect, was made while Butler was under the influence of
Ruskin's _Elements of Drawing_--say about 1870.  He threw off that
influence later.

16.  Four water-colour notes in one frame.

One is inscribed "S.B." and another "Kingston, near Lewes."  I suppose
that they are all on the South Downs, and they are all early--say 1870.



JAMES FERGUSON


17.  Crayon drawing: Butler playing Handel, 1870 (?).

Reproduced in the _Memoir_ (I. ix.).  Ferguson was a fellow art-student
with Butler.



SAMUEL BUTLER


18.  Oil Painting: The Valle di Sambucco, above Fusio.

The sambucco or sambuco is the elder tree.  Butler, writing of this
valley (_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. xxvi.; new ed. ch. xxv.), says:
"Here, even in summer, the evening air will be crisp, and the dew will
form as soon as the sun goes off; but the mountains at one end of it will
keep the last rays of the sun.  It is then the valley is at its best,
especially if the goats and cattle are coming together to be milked."

19.  Water-colour: The Rocca Borromeo, Angera, Lago Maggiore.  Entrance
to the Castle.  1871.

The birthplace of S. Carlo Borromeo.  It was over this gateway as well as
over the gateway of Fenis (no. 53), that he told me there ought to be a
fresco of Fortune with her Wheel (_Memoir_, ch. xx.)  The Rocca Borromeo,
Angera, and Arona are mentioned in _Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. xxiv. (new
edn., ch. xxiii.), and several times in the _Memoir_, _e.g._ ch. ix.,
xvi.

20.  Water-colour: The Rocca Borromeo.  A Room in the Castle.  1871.

I am not sure whether or not this is the room in which S. Carlo Borromeo
was born.  One view of that room is in _Alps and Sanctuaries_ ch. xxiv.
(new edition, ch. xxiii).  This may be the same room looking towards the
left and showing a piece of window-seat and shutter.

21.  Water-colour: Amsteg.  1871.

22.  Water-colour: Fobello.  A Christening.  1871.

This was to have been a picture for the Academy, but he did not finish
it.  Here are shown women with short skirts and leggings.  They dress
like this so that they can climb into the ash trees and pull off the
leaves which they throw down upon the grass to be mixed up with the hay.
(_Memoir_, ch. ix.)

23.  Oil Painting: Varallo-Sesia.  The Washing Place.  1871.

"Butler made three oil sketches at Varallo all the same size, about
16x20.  One is the washing place outside the town."  (_Diary of a
Journey_, p. 16).  The other two were both done in the Piazza on the
Sacro Monte.  One was given to the Municipio of Varallo-Sesia; the other
to the Avvocato Francesco Negri of Casale-Monferrato.

24.  Oil Painting: Monte Bisbino, near Como.  1876.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. xxi.  The white sanctuary on the summit
shines like a diamond in some lights.

25.  Oil Painting: From S. Nicolao, Mendrisio.  1876.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. xxi.



GEORGE McCULLOCH


26.  Two lots of studies of women, about 1876.

McCulloch was a friend and fellow art-student of Butler's, and is
mentioned in the _Memoir_, "an admirable draughtsman."



SAMUEL BUTLER


27.  Oil sketch: Low wall and grass in front, snowy mountains behind.  It
must be a view in the Leventina Valley.

28.  Water-colour inscribed "S.B.": Leatherhead Church.

Butler was particularly pleased with the dormer windows, an unusual
feature in a church roof.  This must have been done somewhere about 1877,
but there is no evidence.  This is one of the pictures given by Alfred.

29.  Oil Painting: Montreal, Canada, from the Mountain, about 1877.

30.  Oil Painting: Calpiogna, Val Leventina.  1877.

Evening, looking down the valley.

31.  Oil Painting: Three sketches on one panel, scenes in the Val
Leventina.

They are near Faido, but I cannot further identify them.

32.  Oil Painting: Calonico.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. v.

33.  Oil Painting: Tengia.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. iv.

34.  Oil Painting: Prato.

Other views of Prato appear in _Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. iii.

35.  Oil Painting: Lago Tom, Piora, Val Leventina.  1877.

Ch. vi. in _Alps and Sanctuaries_ is headed "Piora."  "Piora in fact is a
fine breezy upland valley of singular beauty, and with a sweet atmosphere
of cow about it."  Butler thought he knew what went on in Piora and, as
he proceeds through the valley, he says: "Here I heard that there were
people, and the people were not so much asleep as the simple peasantry of
these upland valleys are expected to be by nine o'clock in the evening.
For now was the time when they had moved up from Ronco, Altanca, and
other villages in some numbers to cut the hay, and were living for a
fortnight or three weeks in the chalets upon the Lago di Cadagna.  As I
have said, there is a chapel, but I doubt whether it is attended during
this season with the regularity with which the parish churches of Ronco,
Altanca, etc., are attended during the rest of the year.  The young
people, I am sure, like these annual visits to the high places, and will
be hardly weaned from them.  Happily the hay will always be there, and
will have to be cut by someone, and the old people will send the young
ones."

The foregoing passage throws light upon that other passage in _Life and
Habit_, ch. ii., about S. Paul, which concludes thus: "But the true
grace, with her groves and high places, and troops of young men and
maidens crowned with flowers, and singing of love and youth and wine--the
true grace he drove out into the wilderness--high up, it may be, into
Piora, and into such-like places.  Happy they who harboured her in her
ill report."

After Ernest has received Alethea's money, and while he and Edward
Overton are returning from Christina's funeral, in ch. lxxxiv. of _The
Way of All Flesh_, he tells his godfather his plans for spending the next
year or two.  He has formed a general impression that the most vigorous
and amiable of known nations--the modern Italians, the old Greeks and
Romans, and the South Sea Islanders--have not been purists.  He wants to
find out what such people do; they are the practical authorities on the
question--What is best for man?

"Let us," he says, "settle the fact first and fight about the moral
tendencies afterwards."

"In fact," said I laughingly, "you mean to have high old times."

"Neither higher nor lower," was the answer, "than those people whom I can
find to have been the best in all ages."

Accordingly Ernest left England and visited "almost all parts of the
world, but only staying in those places where he found the inhabitants
unusually good-looking and agreeable."  "At last in the spring of 1867 he
returned, his luggage stained with the variation of each hotel
advertisement 'twixt here and Japan.  He looked very brown and strong,
and so well-favoured that it almost seemed as if he must have caught some
good looks from the people among whom he had been staying."

We are not told what particular countries Ernest went to; Japan is
mentioned, but less because Ernest went there than because the name of a
distant place was wanted to justify and complete the echo of the
description of Sir Walter Blunt in I. _Hen. IV._ i. 64:

   Stained with the variation of each soil
   Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours.

Butler confided to me verbally that Ernest visited, among other places,
Piora, and that he stayed there "when the mowing grass was about." {8}

36.  Oil Painting: inscribed, "S. Butler.  Sketch of his own head.  April
1878."

This is one of the series of portraits of himself referred to in the note
to no. 7.  Another of these later portraits was given after his death to
Christchurch, New Zealand; and another to the Schools, Shrewsbury.  This
one was given by Butler to me soon after it was painted, and it remained
in my possession till 1911, when I gave it to St. John's College.  It is
reproduced as the frontispiece to vol. I. of the _Memoir_.

37.  Oil Sketch: Calonico.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. v.  On a panel with no. 38, Rossura, on the
other side.

38.  Oil Sketch: Rossura.  The altar by the porch of the church.  1878.

On a panel with no. 37, Calonico, on the other side.

39.  Oil sketch on a panel: Rossura, from inside the porch looking out.

"I know few things more touching in their way than the porch of Rossura
church."  (_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. iv.)

"The church is built on a slope, and the porch, whose entrance is on a
lower level than that of the floor of the church, contains a flight of
steps leading up to the church door.  The porch is there to shelter the
steps, on and around which the people congregate and gossip before and
after service, especially in bad weather.  They also sometimes overflow
picturesquely, and kneel praying on the steps while service is going on
inside."  (_Memoir_, I. 284-5.)

In _Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. iv., is an illustration showing the people
kneeling on the steps while "there came a sound of music through the open
door--the people lifting up their voices and singing, as near as I can
remember, something which on the piano would come thus:" and then follow
a few bars of chords.

In the list which appeared in _The Eagle_, vol. xxxix., no. 175, March
1918, writing of no. 38: "Rossura: the altar by the porch of the church,
1878," I said that it had been removed.  On reconsideration, I am not
sure that it has been removed; but I have not been to Rossura for thirty
years or more and cannot now say for certain.  I believe, however, that
it is still there, and that when I said it had been removed I was
thinking of the alteration of an opening which there was formerly in the
west wall of the porch, under the portrait of S. Carlo Borromeo, which
hangs between the two windows.  This opening is mentioned in ch. iv. of
_Alps and Sanctuaries_, and Butler says that it had to be closed because
the wind blew through it and made the church too cold.  It is shown with
the portrait and the two windows in another illustration in ch. iv.

The first illustration in ch. iv. of _Alps and Sanctuaries_ shows how the
chapel with the altar in it (no. 38) is placed in relation to the porch.
This is the chapel he was thinking of when he wrote:

   "The church has been a good deal restored during the last few years,
   and an interesting old chapel--with an altar in it--at which Mass was
   said during a time of plague, while the people stood some way off in a
   meadow, has just been entirely renovated; but, as with some English
   churches, the more closely a piece of old work is copied, the more
   palpably does the modern spirit show through it, so here the opposite
   occurs, for the old-worldliness of the place has not been impaired by
   much renovation, though the intention has been to make everything as
   modern as possible."

In 1878, the first time I was with Butler in Italy and in the Canton
Ticino, he talked a great deal about the porch of Rossura; there is a
passage in ch. xvi. of the _Memoir_ about it.  For him it was the work of
a man who did it because he sincerely wanted to do it, and who learnt how
to do by doing; it was not the work of one who first attended lectures by
a professor in an academy, learnt the usual tricks in an art school, and
then, not wanting to do, gloried in the display of his technical skill.
That is to say, it was done in the right spirit.  The result of doing
things in this way will sometimes appear incompetent; this never
embarrassed Butler, provided that he could detect the sincerity; for
where sincerity is incompetence may be forgiven; but the incompetence
must not be so great as to obscure the artist's meaning.  At Rossura the
sincerity is obvious, and the building is so perfect an adaptation of the
means to the end that there is no suggestion of incompetence.

Rossura porch was thus an illustration of what he says in _Alps and
Sanctuaries_ in the chapter "Considerations on the Decline of Italian
Art."  It was more than merely a piece of architecture.  When Butler
contemplated it he saw also the chapel with its altar and the people
standing in the meadow during the plague; he saw the same people, after
the pestilence had been stayed, kneeling on the steps in the dimness, the
sky bright through the arch beyond them and the distant mountains blue
and snowy, while the music floated out through the open church door; he
saw through the windows the gleaming slopes about Cornone and Dalpe, and,
hanging on the wall between them, the picture of austere old S. Carlo
with his hands joined in prayer.  All these things could be written about
in _Alps and Sanctuaries_, but they could not be brought into the
illustrations apart from the text; and anyone who looks at Butler's
sketches of Rossura may be disappointed.  If he does not bear these
things in mind he will not understand what Butler meant by saying that he
knew of few things more touching in their way than the porch of Rossura
church.  He will be like a man listening to programme-music and knowing
nothing of the programme.

40.  Pencil sketch inscribed: "Handel when a boy.  Pencil sketch from an
old picture sold at Puttick and Simpson's and sketched by me while on
view.  Dec. 15th, 1879.  S.B."

On the same mount with the sketch-portrait of Robert Doncaster, no. 56.

41.  Water-colour: Otford, Kent; from inside the church looking out
through the porch.  1879.

42.  Drawing in pencil and ink: Edgeware.  1880.

43.  Oil Painting: Rimella, Val Mastallone; up the Valley from Varallo-
Sesia.

44.  Oil Painting: Eynsford, Kent.

45.  Oil Painting: On the S. Bernardino Pass.

46.  Oil Painting: Bellinzona, The Castle.

In the same frame with no. 47.

47.  Oil Painting: Mesocco, The Castle.

_Alps and Sanctuaries_, ch. xix.  Butler always had this and no. 46 in
the same frame.

48.  Oil Painting: Bellinzona, The Castle.

He made many sketches of the Castle at Bellinzona, this and no. 46 are
the only two I have found; none was quite satisfactory because there was
no point of view from which the towers composed well behind a good
foreground.

49.  Drawing in pencil and ink: The Sacro Monte, Varese, from the seventh
or Flagellation Chapel.

He intended to paint a picture this size, and started by making this
drawing, which is an enlargement of the drawing reproduced in _Alps and
Sanctuaries_, ch. xxiii. (1881), but he did not proceed with the
painting.

50.  Drawing in pencil and ink: Boulogne-sur-Mer, La Porte Gayole.

This was a favourite view which he often sketched; but I have only found
this example.



SAMUEL BUTLER AND OTHERS


51.  All (except a few which are lost) the original drawings for _Alps
and Sanctuaries_.

Placed here in order of date because the book was published in 1881.  Some
of the drawings are by Charles Gogin, who did the frontispiece and the
Madonna della Neve on the title page, and who also introduced the figures
into those of Butler's drawings which have figures; and a few are by me.
There are among this lot also several sketches, etc., by various persons
which Butler collected as illustrating his "Considerations on the Decline
of Italian Art."  Some are published in the chapter so headed in the
book, but others were not published.



SAMUEL BUTLER


52.  Oil Painting: Portrait of Henry Festing Jones.  1882.

53.  Oil Painting: Castello Fenis, Val d'Aosta.  1882.

It was over one of the gateways of this Castle that Fortune with her
Wheel was to appear in a fresco.  See no. 19.



HENRY FESTING JONES


54.  Oil Painting: View from Butler's room in Clifford's Inn showing the
tower of the Law Courts.  1882.

Drawn with the camera lucida.  Reproduced in the _Memoir_, ch. xx.

55.  Oil Painting: Unfinished sketch-portrait of Butler.  1882

Drawn with the camera lucida.  Referred to in the _Memoir_, I. 135-136,
in letters from which extracts are given below.

_Miss Savage to Butler_.

   31_st_ _October_, 1883: I went to the Fisheries Exhibition last week
   and spent a rather pleasant day.  I was by myself for one thing, and,
   for another, took great delight in gazing at a life-size model of a
   sea-captain clad in yellow oil-skins and a Sou'wester.  It was
   executed in that style of art that you so greatly admire in the
   Italian Churches, and was so good a likeness of _you_ that I think you
   must have sat for it.  The serious occupations of my day were having
   dinner and tea, and the relaxations, buying shrimps in the fish-market
   and then giving them to the sea-gulls and cormorants.  My most exalted
   pleasure was to look at your effigy, which I should like to be able to
   buy, though, as I have not a private chapel in my castle, I hardly
   know where I could put it if I had it.  Upon the whole I enjoyed
   myself, but I am glad to hear that the Exhibition is to be closed to-
   day, so that I cannot by any possibility go there again.

_Butler to Miss Savage_.

   5_th_ _November_, 1883: I believe I am very like a sea-captain.  Jones
   began a likeness of me not long since, which I will show you next time
   you come and see me, which is also very like a portrait of a
   sea-captain.

56.  Sketch-portrait of Robert Doncaster.

On the same mount with no. 40.  A tracing is among the miscellaneous
papers given to St. John's.  This sketch of Robert was done, I suspect,
with the camera lucida, and if so its date must be about 1882-3.  Robert
Doncaster was the husband of Mrs. Corrie; that is to say Mrs. Corrie, who
was Butler's laundress in Clifford's Inn, "lost" her husband.  After a
suitable interval it was assumed that he was dead and she married Robert
Doncaster and was known as Mrs. Doncaster.  Robert, who was a half-witted
old man, used to hang about the place, do odd jobs, and make himself
fairly useful.  He died in 1886.

57.  Water-colour: Pinner.  1883.



SAMUEL BUTLER


58.  Oil Painting: Edward James Jones.

Inscribed thus: "Portrait of E. J. Jones, Esq., of the Indian Geological
Survey, Aet. Suae 24, painted by S. Butler, November, 1883."  The date is
not clearly written, but it must be 1883, because my brother Edward, born
5th September, 1859, was twenty-four in 1883, and in November 1883 he
went to Calcutta, having obtained an appointment on the Geological
Survey.  Butler painted the portrait just before he started.

59.  Oil Painting: Chiavenna.  1887.

It looks in some lights like 1881, but in other lights 1887, and it must
be 1887.  Butler did not go abroad in 1881 and he was at Chiavenna in
1887.  This is one of the pictures given by Alfred.



THOMAS SADLER


60.  Black and white drawing: Butler and Scotto in 1888.

Sadler made this for the _Pall Mall Gazette_ from the photograph which is
reproduced in _Ex Voto_; the drawing was reproduced in an article, and a
cutting from the _Pall Mall_ with the reproduction is with the papers
given to St. John's.



SAMUEL BUTLER


61.  Oil Painting: Wembley, Middlesex.  Sketch of the back of the Green
Man public-house, since burnt down.

Butler intended to finish this, and send it to the Royal Academy, but he
got tired of it and turned it up.



THOMAS SADLER


62.  Water-colour drawing of the Vecchietto in the Deposition Chapel at
Varallo-Sesia.

63.  Water-colour drawing in black and white of a boy with a basket at
Varallo.

Sadler made these two drawings about 1890 from photographs taken by
Butler in 1888.



SAMUEL BUTLER


64.  Water-colour: copy of a landscape behind a small Madonna and Child
by Bartolomeo Veneto, signed and dated 1505.

I forget the precise date, but I think it was about 1898, when Butler was
searching in real landscape for the original of the castle which appears
in the background of one of the Giovanni Bellini pictures of the Madonna
and Child in the National Gallery, the one with the bird on the tree and
the man ploughing.  It may now be attributed to some other Venetian
painter.  He would have been pleased if he could have found the original
of the background of any picture by one of his favourite painters.  This
copy was made to fix in his mind the castle on the hill, which he hoped
afterwards to identify with some real place.  But he never succeeded.



HENRY FESTING JONES


65.  Water-colour: Jones's chambers in Staple Inn, Holborn.  1899.

66.  Water-colour: another view in the same room.  1899.

In these rooms Butler nearly always spent his evenings from 1893, when I
moved into them, until the end of his life.  The frames of these pictures
are veneered with oak from the Hall of Staple Inn, and into each are
inserted two buttons showing the wool-pack, the badge of the Inn, which
is said to be named from the Wool-Staplers.

When Butler and I were on the Rigi-Scheidegg with Hans Faesch in 1900 I
had these two sketches with me, and was showing them to the landlord, who
spoke English.  He looked at them and considered them carefully for some
moments.  Then he said gravely "Ah I see; much things.  That means
dustings; and then breakings; and then hangriness."



SAMUEL BUTLER


67.  Water-colour: Meien near Wassen on the S. Gottardo.  1896.

We went often to Meien to sketch when we were staying at Wassen on the S.
Gottardo.  We took our lunch with us, and ate it at the fountain in the
village.  "The old priest also came to the fountain to wash his shutters,
which had been taken down for the summer, and it was now time to bring
them out again and replace them for the winter" (_Memoir_, II. 236).  The
house on the left is the priest's house, and the shutters are already up
at one of his windows.

68.  Pen and ink sketch: Trapani and the Islands from Mount Eryx about
1897.

This sketch is reproduced in _The Authoress of the Odyssey_, ch. ix.  He
did it to show the situation of Trapani and the Islands with Marettimo
"all highest up in the sea."  In the Odyssey Ithaca is "all highest up in
the sea," and Butler supposed that the authoress in so describing it was
thinking of Marettimo.

69.  Wash drawing: Trapani and the Islands from Mount Eryx about 1898.

He wished to make a more complete version of no. 68, but this was as far
as he could get; there was not enough time and there were too many
interruptions.

70.  Pencil sketch inscribed, "Calatafimi, Sund. May 13th, 1900.  2
hours.  Eleven a.m. is the best light."

I added "S. Butler."  He could not continue because there came on a
terrific scirocco which lasted two or three days.

71.  Water-colour: Taormina, the Theatre and Etna.  1900.

This shows the fragments of the stones that are strewn about in the
orchestra which Butler said were like the fragments of My Duty towards My
Neighbour that lay strewn about in his memory.  It would take a lot of
work to put them all back into their places and reconstruct the original.
(_Memoir_, II. 292.)

72.  Water-colour: Siena.  1900.

73.  Water-colour: Pisa, inside the top of the Leaning Tower.  1900.

74.  Water-colour: Wassen.  1901.

75.  Water-colour: Wassen.  1901.

76.  Water-colour: Trapani, S. Liberale and Lo Scoglio di Mal Consiglio.
1901.

See _The Authoress of the Odyssey_.  The Scoglio is the ship of Ulysses
which Neptune turned into a rock as she was on her way home to Scheria.

77.  Rough sketch by Butler of the islands Marettimo, Levanzo, and
Favignana.

Two views showing how Marettimo is hidden by Levanzo when you are below
and comes out over Levanzo when you are up Mount Eryx.



HENRY FESTING JONES


78.  My first attempt in colour to draw the islands from Mount Eryx.

I saw I should not have time to finish it, and, instead, did no. 80.

79.  A volume of thirty-four leaves of drawings in pencil and ink.

I did all these under Butler's auspices, and often he was sitting near
doing another sketch of much the same view.  It may be said that they are
the work of his pupil.

80.  Drawing in pencil and ink: Trapani and the Islands from Mount Eryx.
1913.

Reproduced in the _Memoir_, ch. xxxii.



SAMUEL BUTLER AND OTHERS


81.  A portfolio of miscellaneous drawings, prints, etchings,
photographs, etc., by Butler, Gogin, and Sadler.

This is the portfolio containing the small water-colour of Dieppe, 1866.
I have given that the prominence of a place (no. 11) because it is
interesting to compare it with the more finished Dieppe, no. 10.  Possibly
the portfolio contains others (_e.g._ Dinant), which it will be thought
proper to take out and have mounted and framed.

"Visit to Inveraray . . . and after lunch we went into the large drawing-

years old.  And now I return, alas! without my beloved husband, to find

V.  BOOKS FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF SAMUEL BUTLER


BUTLER wrote to Robert Bridges, 6 Feb. 1900, "I have, I verily believe,
the smallest library of any man in London who is by way of being
literary."  (_Memoir_, II., 320.)

Cf. no. 9 in Section I. Pictures, "Interior of Butler's sitting-room,"
where part of his library is shown.  The rest of his books were in a
cupboard between his sitting-room and his painting-room.  They all passed
under the residuary bequest in his will to his nephew, Henry Thomas
Butler, who gave them to me.  Some were taken by Streatfeild, his
literary executor, and some few were lost in transitu; the remainder are
here.

AGAR, T. L.  Emendationes Homericae.  [189-]

With notes by Butler.

ALLEN, GRANT.  Charles Darwin.  By Grant Allen.  (English Worthies.)
London, 1885.

Butler was asked to review this, but declined on the ground that there
was too strong a personal hostility between both Darwin and Grant Allen
and himself to make it possible for him to review the book without a bias
against it.  (_Memoir_, II. 28.)

BIBLE, THE HOLY.  Oxford, 1836.

Inscribed "Samuel Butler, from his affectionate Godmother and Aunt Anna
Worsley, September 13th, 1836."  So that he was not christened till he
was more than nine months old, and he used to say that this delay was a
risky business, because during all those months the devil had the run of
him.  He imitated the inscription in this Bible for the inscription in
the christening Bible which Ernest spurns from him when he is about to
undertake the conversion of Miss Maitland in chapter lx. of _The Way of
All Flesh_.  But he imitated it too closely for he wrote, "It was the
Bible given him at his christening by his affectionate Godmother and
Aunt, Elizabeth Allaby."  Whereas Ernest only had one godmother, and she
was Alethea, the sister of Theobald.  Anna Worsley was a sister of

away together after their marriage.  And cf. _Life and Habit_, ch. ii.,
where, after quoting from a journal an extract about Lycurgus, Butler
proceeds: "Yet this truly comic paper does not probably know that it is
comic, any more than the kleptomaniac knows that he steals, or than John
Milton knew that he was a humorist when he wrote a hymn upon the
Circumcision and spent his honeymoon in composing a treatise on Divorce."

This is part of Vol. I. of Malone's "Supplement to the Edition of
Shakespeare's Plays published in 1778 by Samuel Johnson and George
Steevens."  I do not know where Butler got it; he wanted Malone's
comments on the Sonnets and he may have bought this second-hand or it may
have been given to him.  It was probably in a bad state, for he had it
bound; there is an entry to that effect in his account book, 30th March,
1899.

VI.  ATLASES AND MAPS
FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF SAMUEL BUTLER


Some of the maps are marked with red lines showing, in the words of
another illustrious Johnian, "fields invested with purpureal gleams."
These red lines, specially noticeable in Butler's ordnance maps of the
neighbourhood within thirty miles round London, denote his country walks,
and are referred to in his Introduction to _Alps and Sanctuaries_.

Persons and Junior Classes in Schools.  Selected from Dr. Butler's

Langar.  London, 1870.  _Also_ an edition inscribed, "Samuel Butler,
October 20th, 1850"; and an edition of Dr. Butler's "Atlas of Antient
Geography."

Environs of London, North side (eastern half missing).

Environs of London, South side--Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Maidstone.

There is something wrong; one piece is much dirtier than the other; the
two do not belong to one another.  The dirty one is inscribed, almost
illegibly, thus: "S. Butler, 15, Clifford's Inn, Fleet Street, London,
E.G.  Please return to the above address.  The finder, if poor, will be
rewarded; if rich, thanked."  May be he did lose one half, and it was not
returned, and he bought another.

VIII.  MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS
FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF OR RELATING TO SAMUEL BUTLER


Thomas Harris, of Shrewsbury.

Butler when a boy was amused by the advertisement put up over his shop by
this man, who was a baker.  He copied or invented the two pictures
showing Harris (1) making bride cakes, (2) making funeral cakes, and
composed the music.  Miss Butler showed it to me at Shrewsbury in June or
July, 1902, and I copied it.

MS. copies of "The New Scriptures," according to Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley
and Spencer.

The first twenty-four verses of this appeared in an American paper (the
_Index_, if I remember right) many years ago.  They were given to me by
Herbert Phipson; I showed them to Butler; he copied them and composed
verses 25 to 33.

Testimonials by Eyre Crowe, A.R.A.; G. K. Fortescue; R. Garnett, LL.D.;
A. C. Gow, A.R.A.; T. Heatherley; the Rev. B. H. Kennedy, D.D.; Henry
Stacy Marks, R.A.; and W. T. Marriott, M.P., submitted by Butler in 1886
when a Candidate for the Slade Professorship of Fine Art at Cambridge.

Two numbers of the Parish Magazine of St. Augustine's, Kilburn, Mar. 1887
and April 1887.

Between pp. 80 and 81 of the March number are unsuitable advertisements
of Pears' Soap involving the Bishop Q of Wangaloo and Lillie Langtry.
Their appearance drew from the Editor, pp. 97 and 112 of the April
number, an expression of regret, distress, and surprise, and a statement
that precautions had been taken against any occurrence of a similar
nature in future.  If I remember right Miss Savage sent these to Butler
and they are referred to in their correspondence, but perhaps not in any
of the letters included in the _Memoir_.

Review of "Luck or Cunning?" written by George Bernard Shaw, which
appeared in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, 31st May, 1887.

This was given to me by Dan Rider, who told me that Bernard Shaw's
original review, which he wrote off his own bat, was very much more
laudatory and much longer, but the Editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ cut
it down in length and took out some of the praise because he was afraid
of offending the Darwins and their friends.

other contributions to the press.  See the _Memoir_.

Photographs illustrating Butler's notions about the Portraits of Gentile
and Giovanni Bellini as to which he wrote to the _Athenaeum_, 20 Feb.
1886.  (_Memoir_, ch. xxv.)

Photographs to illustrate his notions about the Holbein drawing, "La
Danse," dealt with in the article in the _Universal Review_, "L'Affaire
Holbein-Rippel."  Together with various papers relating to the same
matter.  This article was not reproduced in _Essays on Life_, _Art and
Science_ (afterwards _The Humour of Homer_) because of the trouble of
reproducing the illustrations, but it is among the _Universal Review_
articles bound together and included in this catalogue (p. 19).

A print of the great statue of S. Carlo Borromeo, near Arona, called "S.
Carlone."

A collection of photographs of Italian pictures, unmounted.

which is in S. Maria delle Grazie at Varallo-Sesia.  It is in twenty-one
compartments.

Two cards, not so large, with photographs of pictures and frescoes by
Gaudenzio.  One of these reproduces frescoes and pictures in the
Crucifixion Chapel at Varallo.  In the left-hand bottom corner is the
whole of the fresco in S. Maria delle Grazie showing how the twenty-one
compartments are placed.  The other card contains Gaudenzio's frescoes in
the Church of S. Cristoforo at Vercelli.

A card with five photographs, two of the frescoes at Busto Arsizio near
Varese--at least, I think that is where they are.  One is "St. John
Baptist's head in a charger," the other "The baptism in the Jordan."
Butler particularly liked the scratchings of names and dates on the
former.  The other three photographs are of pictures.  The foregoing six
cards (three, two and one) used to hang framed in Butler's chambers.

A woman in a black dress from Lima.  Used by Butler to make female heads
for sale, but he was not successful.

_The Weekly Press_, N.Z., 21st Mar. 1917.  Page 26 contains views of

certain.  The cabinet photograph of Canon Butler resembles the father in
"Family Prayers"; but Butler cannot have used this photograph, which was
done when Canon Butler was an old man, for a picture painted in 1864.

Photographs of S. Butler:

(1)  Soon after his return from New Zealand.

(2)  1866.

(3)  Taken by Mrs. Bridges in the garden at Langar about 1866.

(4)  His identification photograph at the Paris Exhibition, 1867.  2
copies.

(5)  At Milan about 1886.

(6)  At 15 Clifford's Inn, by Alfred, about 1888.

Butler kept the glass one on his mantelpiece until Pauli's death in 1897.
Then he removed it.  He would have removed it earlier, but Pauli came to
his rooms to lunch three times a week, and would have noticed its
absence.  For Pauli see the _Memoir_.

Hans Rudolf Faesch as a boy.

Hans Rudolf Faesch, taken by Butler in 1893.

Cavaliere Biagio Ingroja of Calatafimi.

Professore Alberto Giacalone-Patti of Trapani.

XI.  EFFECTS
FORMERLY THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SAMUEL BUTLER


One mahogany table with two flaps.

Butler used this table for his meals, for his writing, and for all
purposes to which a table can be put.  A corner of it covered with a red
cloth is seen in the picture of the interior of his room.  See p. 4, no.
9.

Sandwich case.

This he took with him on his Sunday walks and sketching excursions.

Passport.

Pocket magnifying glass.

Address book.

Homeopathic medicine case.

He always took this with him on his travels.

Two account books, 1897-1900 and 1900-1902.

Butler destroyed his early account books when he made the Skeleton Diary
of his life which is in Vol. III. of his MS. Note-Books.  After his death
the remaining account books were destroyed except these two.

Books in which Butler used to keep his accounts by double entry.  The
handwriting during the early years is Butler's, afterwards it is
Alfred's.  Journal, 1895-1902; Cash Book, 1881-1899; Cash Book,
1899-1902; Union Bank Book, 1881-1902; Ledger.

A set of books containing accounts for his published works.

Two of the small note-books which after April 1882 Butler always carried
in his pocket and in which he made the notes afterwards copied into his
full-size MS. Note-Books.

Before 1882 he used some other kind of pocket note-book.  The first one
he had of this kind was sent to him by Miss Savage in a letter of 18th
April, 1882, from which the following is an extract; the words in square
brackets are a note by Butler on Miss Savage's letter.

   "I send you a little present; the leaves tear out, so that when you
   leave your note-book at the "Food of Health" [I don't remember ever
   going to the "Food of Health."  I do not know the place.  S. B.] or
   elsewhere, as you sometimes have done, you will not lose so much, and
   then you can put the torn leaves into one of the little drawers in
   your cabinet which is just made for such documents."  (_Memoir_, I.
   373.)

The cabinet she refers to was one of the two Japanese cabinets, the next
items, which he had bought at Neighbour's grocery and tea-shop in Oxford
Street, and which she had seen in his rooms.  He used to keep stamps in
them.

One small Japanese cabinet.

One larger Japanese cabinet.

Two pen trays.

One camera lucida with table (see the _Memoir_).

One round wood-carving: a female bust.

Two large dishes, German or Swiss, which stood on his table.

One tin case holding pencils and brushes for water-colour sketching.

One tin water-bottle for sketching.  One sketching camp-stool.  One
sketching portfolio.  One water-colour paint-box.

One sloping desk.

"I shoud explain that I cannot write unless I have a sloping desk."   See
"Quis desiderio--" (_The Humour of Homer_).  This is the sloping desk on
which he wrote in Clifford's Inn.

One pair of chamois horns given him by Dionigi Negri at Varallo Sesia.

One handle and webbing in which he carried his books to and from the
British Museum.

A photograph showing one wall of Butler's chambers in Clifford's Inn with
the fireplace and accompanying sketch plan.

Some of the pictures mentioned in Section I. of this Catalogue can be
identified, and also the following nine items, which are on the
mantelpiece or on the wall.  The two dolls (no. 9) were destroyed by
Butler about 1898; the other eight objects are included in this
collection at St. John's.

One pair of pewter candlesticks (1).

One bust of Handel (2).

One plate, which he called "Three Acres and a Cow," because it seems to
be decorated in illustration of that catch-word (3).

Two crockery holy water holders; only one is shown in the photograph (4).

Three medallions under glass, representing, in some kind of plaster, the
Madonna di Oropa (5).

Three crockery examples of "the Virgin with Child" (6).

One only is shown in the photo.  One of these is from Oropa where the
Virgin and Child are both black, see "A Medieval Girl-School" in _The
Humour of Homer_.  These holy water holders and Madonnas are some of the
cheap religious knick-knacks which are sold at most Italian Sanctuaries.
We often brought back a few and gave them away to Gogin, Alfred, Clark,
and other friends.

Bag for pennies (7).

Miss Savage's kettle-holder (8).

In Oct. 1884 (see the _Memoir_), about four months before her death, Miss
Savage sent Butler a present of a pair of socks which she had knitted
herself, and she promised to make him some more.  Butler gratefully
accepted her gift, but

   "As for doing me any more, I flatly forbid it.  I believe you don't
   like my books, and want to make me say I won't give you any more if
   you make me any more socks; and then you will make me some more in
   order not to get the books.  No, I will let you read my stupid books
   in manuscript and help me that way.  If you like to make me a kettle-
   holder, you may, for I only have one just now, and I like to have two
   because I always mislay one; but I won't have people working their
   fingers out to knit me stockings."

_Miss Savage to Butler_, 27_th_ _Oct._ 1884: "Here is a kettle-holder.
And I can only say that a man who is equal to the control of two kettle-
holders fills me with awe, and I shall begin to be afraid of you. . . .
The kettle-holder is very clumsy and ugly, but please to remember that I
am not a many-sided genius, and to expect me to excel in kettle-holders
_and_ stockings is unreasonable.  I take credit to myself, however, for
affixing a fetter to it, so that you may chain it up if it is too much
disposed to wander.  My expectation is that it is too thick for you to
grasp the kettle with, and the kettle will slip out of your hand and
scald you frightfully.  I shall be sorry for you but you would have it,
so upon your own head be it."

_Butler to Miss Savage_, 28_th_ _Oct._ 1884: "The kettle-holder is
beautiful; it is like a filleted sole, and I am very fond of filleted
sole.  It is not at all too thick, and fits my kettle to perfection."

The subject is developed antiphonally between Miss Savage and Butler
throughout several letters, and near the close comes this note made by
Butler when "editing his remains" at the end of his life:

"I need hardly say that the kettle-holder hangs by its fetter on the wall
beside my fire, and is not allowed to be used by anyone but myself.  S.B.
January 21st, 1902."

Two small Dutch dolls (9)

Mr. Charles Archer Cook was at Trinity Hall with me.  He is mentioned in
the _Memoir_ as having edited _The Athenaeum_ in October, 1885, during
the absence of MacColl, the editor.  Butler and I sometimes dined with
him and met his brother, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Edward T. Cook and his
wife.  Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Cook came to tea with Butler, and Alfred was
showing them round the sitting room, while Butler was in his painting
room, where he had gone to look for something.

"These are the pictures which the governor does when he is away," said
Alfred, "and these are the photographs which he brings back with him and
the plates and images."

"And please, Alfred, what are these two little dolls among the pictures?"

"Oh, those, ma'am!  Those are ---."

"Alfred!" exclaimed the reproving voice of Butler, who although in the
next room, had overheard.

"Well, Sir," replied Alfred, "that's what we always call them."

Alfred was referring to a recent divorce case in which the names of two
ladies had been brought prominently before the public, but Butler did not
approve of the names being blurted out in the presence of visitors.

A brass bowl which my brother Edward brought from India.

It always stood on my table in Staple Inn, and Butler used it as an ash-
tray and played with it and liked the sound it made when he struck it.  He
also liked its shape, and was pleased with it for not being "spoilt by
any silly ornament."  It is mentioned in the _Memoir_ (II. xliii.) when
Miss Butler comes to my rooms after Butler's death.

A leather (or sham leather) cigarette case from Palermo (but, I am
afraid, made in Germany).

It contains a fragment of a Greek vase picked up on Mount Eryx and given
to Butler by Bruno Flury.  He was one of the young men who came about him
in 1892 when he broke his foot on the mountain; he afterwards settled in
Pisa, where I saw him in 1901.

Two of the blue and white wine cups mentioned in _Alps and Sanctuaries_
(ch. xxii.; new ed., ch. xxiii.), "A Day at the Cantine."

"These little cups are common crockery, but at the bottom there is
written Viva Bacco, Viva l'Italia, Viva la Gioia, Viva Venere or other
such matter; they are to be had in every crockery shop throughout the
Mendrisiotto, and they are very pretty."

The Viva is not written in full; it is represented by a double V, which
overlaps, so that it looks like W, but the letter W is not used by the
Italians, so there is no chance of its being mistaken by them for
anything but the symbol meaning Viva.

A small horn and tortoiseshell snuff-box from Palermo.

It contains three coins wrapped in paper and a piece of the pilgrim's
cross at Varello-Sesia.  The cross is mentioned somewhere in Butler's
books as being of very hard wood, so hard that the pilgrims have great
difficulty in cutting pieces off it.  So had I in cutting off this bit.

The day after Butler's death Alfred came to me with the coins and said:

"I took these out of his pockets, Sir; I thought you ought to have them."

Butler's watch and chain.

Butler used to possess his grandfather's gold watch and chain.  He was
robbed of the watch in Hyde Park one night just before starting on one of
his journeys to Canada; he then bought this silver watch at Benson's,
and, if I remember right, wore it with the gold chain.  He was robbed of
the chain in Fetter Lane, Oct. 1893 (_Memoir_, II. 167).  He then bought
a silver chain, which, with the silver watch, passed under his will to
Alfred.  Alfred wore them until 1919, when the watch was declared by an
expert to be beyond repair.  I took it from him, giving him in exchange
the watch of my brother Charlie, who had recently died.

The matchbox which Alfred gave to Butler.

When Alfred knew that I was handing Butler's watch and chain on to St.
John's College, he said:

"And then, Sir, they had better have this matchbox which I gave him."

I looked at it and said, "Well, but Alfred, how can that be?  It is dated
1894, and he gave your matchbox to the Turk in 1895."

"I know he did, Sir; and when he told me I was very angry and went out
into Holborn and bought this one and had it engraved same as the other."

"With the old date?"

"Yes, Sir, just the same as the one he gave to the Turk."  See the _Note-
Books_, p. 286.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
