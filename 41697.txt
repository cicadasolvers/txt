ANALYSES FOR...PHYSICIANS

By the Analytic Laboratories of Merck & Co. New York

_Examinations of Water, Milk, Blood, Urine, Sputum, Pus, Food
Products, Beverages, Drugs, Minerals, Coloring Matters, etc., for
diagnostic, prophylactic, or other scientific purposes._

All analyses at these Laboratories are so conducted as to assure the
best service attainable on the basis of the latest scientific
developments. The laboratories are amply supplied with a perfect
quality of reagent materials, and with the most efficient constructions
of modern apparatus and instruments. The probable cost for some of the
most frequently needed researches is approximately indicated below:

    Sputum, for tuberculosis bacilli,                         $3.00
    Urine, for tuberculosis bacilli,                           3.00
    Milk, for tuberculosis bacilli,                            3.00
    Urine, qualitative, for one constituent,                   1.50
    Urine, qualitative, for each additional constituent,       1.00
    Urine, quantitative, for each constituent,                 3.00
    Urine, sediment, microscopical,                            1.50
    Blood, for ratio of white to red corpuscles,               2.00
    Blood, for Widal's typhoid reaction,                       2.00
    Water, for general fitness to drink,                      10.00
    Water, for typhoid germs,                                 25.00
    Water, quantitative determination of any one constituent, 10.00
    Pus, for gonococci,                                        3.00

The cost for other analyses--more variable in scope--can only be given
upon closer knowledge of the requirements of individual cases.

All pharmacists in every part of the United States will receive and
transmit orders for the MERCK ANALYTIC LABORATORIES.


_Physicians are earnestly requested to communicate to Merck & Co.,
University Place, New York, any suggestions that may tend to improve
this book for its Second Edition, which will soon be in course of
preparation._

_Whatever the Publishers can do to make Merck's Manual of still greater
service to the Medical Profession will be gladly undertaken and
promptly performed for all subsequent editions._

_Therefore, any Physician who will propose improvements in the
subject-matter (especially as regards the Newer Materia Medica), or in
the arrangement, style, and form of this work, for future editions,
will thus be rendering valuable service, not only to its Publishers,
but to the entire Profession as well!_

MERCK'S 1899 MANUAL

OF THE

MATERIA MEDICA


TOGETHER WITH A SUMMARY OF THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS AND A
CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAMENTS


A READY-REFERENCE POCKET BOOK

FOR THE

PRACTICING PHYSICIAN


CONTAINING

NAMES AND CHIEF SYNONYMS, PHYSICAL FORM AND APPEARANCE, SOLUBILITIES,
PERCENTAGE STRENGTHS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS, THERAPEUTIC USES,
MODES OF ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICATION, REGULAR AND MAXIMUM DOSAGE,
INCOMPATIBLES, ANTIDOTES, PRECAUTIONARY REQUIREMENTS, ETC., ETC.,--OF
THE

CHEMICALS AND DRUGS USUAL IN MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICE


_Compiled from the Most Recent Authoritative Sources and Published by_

MERCK & CO., NEW YORK

Copyright by Merck & Co., New York, 1899




MERCK'S MANUAL is designed to meet a need which every general
practitioner has often experienced. Memory is treacherous. It is
particularly so with those who have much to do and more to think of.
When the best remedy is wanted, to meet indications in cases that are a
little out of the usual run, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible,
to recall the whole array of available remedies so as to pick out the
best. Strange to say, too, it is the most thoroughly informed man that
is likely to suffer to the greatest extent in this way; because of the
very fact that his mind is overburdened. But a mere reminder is all he
needs, to make him at once master of the situation and enable him to
prescribe exactly what his judgment tells him is needed for the
occasion.

In MERCK'S MANUAL the physician will find a complete Ready-Reference
Book covering the entire eligible Materia Medica. A glance over it just
before or just after seeing a patient will refresh his memory in a way
that will facilitate his coming to a decision. In this book, small as
it is, he will find the essential data found in the ponderous
Dispensatories, together with the facts of newest record, which can
appear only in future editions of those works.

Part I affords at a glance a descriptive survey, in one alphabetic
series, of the entire Materia Medica to-day in general use by the
American profession. Part II contains a summary of Therapeutic
Indications for the employment of remedies, arranged according to
the Pathologic Conditions to be combated. Part III presents a
Classification of Medicaments in accordance with their Physiologic
Actions.


The publishers may be allowed to state that they have labored long and
earnestly, so to shape this little volume that it shall prove a firm
and faithful help to the practitioner in his daily round of duty. They
now send it forth in the confident hope that, the more it is put to the
test of actual use, the more it will grow in the esteem of its
possessor.




CONTENTS.


~Pages 9 to 82.~

~Part First.--THE MATERIA MEDICA, as in actual use to-day by American
Physicians.~ (Alphabetically arranged.)

THIS PART EMBRACES all those Simple Medicinal Substances (that
is, drugs and chemicals) which are in current and well-established use
in the medical practice of this country; or which, if too recently
introduced to be as yet in general use, are vouched for by eminent
authorities in medical science;--also, the medicinally employed
Pharmaceutic Preparations recognized by the United States
Pharmacopoeia.

    (Added thereto, for the convenience of those practitioners who
    prescribe them, are Medicamentous Mixtures advertised only to the
    Profession, but whose composition or mode of manufacture has not
    been made known with sufficient completeness or exactness to
    satisfy all members of the Profession. In the selection the
    publishers have been guided solely by the recognition accorded the
    various preparations by the Profession, according to the best
    information obtained.)

There has also been included, under the title of "Foods and Dietetic
Preparations," a list of such preparations as are frequently prescribed
for infants' diet, or for the sick or convalescent.

OMITTED from the Materia Medica chapter are: Medicaments that
have become obsolete, or that are too rarely used to be of general
interest; and such new remedies as are not yet safely accredited on
reliable authority; also those galenic preparations (syrups, extracts,
pills, essences, elixirs, wines, emulsions, etc.) which are not
standardized according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia; likewise all
articles that are put up and advertised for self-medication by the
lay public.

SEPARATE TITLES in the alphabetic series are accorded, as a rule,
to the botanical drugs and other pharmaceutical mother-substances,
to proximate principles (alkaloids, glucosides, organic acids, etc.),
and to chemical compounds (salts, "synthetics," etc.); while the
official galenic preparations, solutions and dilutions, derived
from them, are mostly mentioned under the titles of their respective
mother-substances. (Thus, for instance, "Dover's Powder" will be
found under "Opium," while "Morphine" is described under its own
title.)

    (_Smaller type_ has been employed--in order to economize
    space--for botanic drugs, gums, and some others of the older drugs
    and preparations which are so long and well known that but little
    reference will need be made to them.)

    (Those substances of the Materia Medica which can be had of the
    MERCK brand are--for the convenience of prescribers--so
    designated).

~Pages 83 to 184.~

~Part Second.--THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS for the use of the Materia
Medica and other agents.~ (Arranged alphabetically under the titles
of the various Pathologic Conditions.)

THIS PART SUMMARIZES in brief form, the principal means of
treatment for each form of disease, as reported to be in good use with
practitioners at the present time. The statements hereon are drawn from
the standard works of the leading modern writers on Therapeutics, and
supplemented--in the case of definite chemicals of more recent
introduction--by the reports of reputable clinical investigators.

~Part Third.--CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAMENTS according to their
Physiologic Actions.~ (Arranged alphabetically under the titles of
the Actions.)

THIS PART RECAPITULATES, for ready survey, such statements as
are already given in "PART I," as to the modes of action of
the various medicaments.

_~When in immediate need~_

of Drugs or Chemicals not at hand, any pharmacist is in a position to
use our EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, which is in operation every day in the
year, Sundays and Holidays included, until 9 p.m.--Hurry orders
reaching us after regular business hours will receive prompt
attention,--_provided_:

1--_that they come by_ WIRE;

2--_that they call for_ MERCK'S _chemicals or drugs_ (no other brands
being in stock with us);

3--_and that the quantity and nature of the goods admit of their being
sent through the_ MAILS.

As it is impossible for us to ascertain in each instance the identity
of a Physician who might wish to make use of this department, we must
insist (for the proper protection of the Profession against the
unauthorized purchase of poisons, etc.; as well as in due recognition,
by us, of the established usage in the traffic with medicines and
drugs) that every such order be transmitted through an established
Pharmacist; and pharmacists, when telegraphing orders to us, should
always mention their jobber to whom the article is to be charged.

We trust that this Department will prove of value in cases of emergency
and immediate need.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
