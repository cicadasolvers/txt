MR. PUNCH AND PAT

(_By way of Introduction_)


  [Illustration: Ragged Irishman standing]

No PUNCH artist has done more with Irish humour than Charles Keene.
Well over a third of the PUNCH drawings on this subject are from his
pencil. Most of the PUNCH artists have made good use of it, Phil May
and Mr. Raven-Hill in particular.

Some of MR. PUNCH'S jokes against the Fenians, Home Rule, and Irish
disloyalty have a bitterness that is quite unusual with him, but none
of these are included in our pages, and he has at other times handled
the same topics with his customary geniality and good-humoured satire.
He makes the most of the Irishman's traditional weakness for "##bulls"
whisky, fighting, and living with his pigs, but he gets an immense
amount of variety out of these themes, and does not neglect to touch
upon other typically Irish characteristics. If you have examples of the
Irishman's blunderings, you have examples also of his ready wit and his
amazing talent for blarney.

We have thus in the present volume a delightful collection of Irish
wit and high spirits. The happy-go-lucky characteristic of Pat is
especially prominent in many of the jokes, and interpreting MR. PUNCH'S
attitude towards the Irishman as one of admiration for his many
excellent qualities, instead of regarding him as the "but" for English
jokes, too often the notion of comic writers, the editor has sought to
represent MR. PUNCH as the friend of Pat, sometimes his critic, but
always his good humoured well-wisher, who laughs at him now and then,
but as often with him.

THE IRISH YOLK.--In the name of the profit--eggs! Irish co-operators
have already made giant strides in the production of milk and butter,
and now the Irish Co-operative Agency has decided, so says the _Cork
Daily Herald_, to "take up the egg trade." We hope the egg-traders
won't be "taken up," too; if so, the trade would be arrested just when
it was starting, and where would the profit be then? "It is stated
that many Irish eggs now reach the English market dirty, stale, and
unsorted," so that wholesale English egg-merchants have preferred to
buy Austrian and French ones. Ireland not able to compete with the
foreigner! Perish the thought! A little technical education judiciously
applied will soon teach the Irish fowl not to lay "shop 'uns."

ERIN GO BRAGH


DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I perceive that there is a movement on foot, initiated
by the patriot Doogan, M.P., for teaching the Irish language to the
youthful Redmonds and Healeys of the Emerald Isle. I am sorry that the
Government has not acquiesced in the motion. I, myself, would bring in
a measure compelling all Hibernian Members of Parliament to denounce
(they never speak) in their native tongue. Just fancy the rapture with
which they would inveigh in a language incapable of comprehension by a
single Sassenach! And what a mighty relief to the other legislators!
If necessary, the Speaker might be provided with an Anglo-Irish
dictionary, or possibly a new post (open to Nationalists only) might be
created, viz., Interpreter for Ireland.

Trusting that my suggestion may be supported by you,

  I am, yours obediently,

IRISH PROVERBS


Every goose thinks his wife a duck.

No news in a newspaper isn't good news.

Manners make the gentleman, and the want of them drives him elsewhere
for his shooting.

A miss is as good as a mile of old women.

Too many cooks spoil the broth of a boy.

It's foolish to spoil one's dinner for a ha'porth of tarts.

There are as fine bulls in Ireland as ever came out of it.

Necessity has no law, but an uncommon number of lawyers.

Better to look like a great fool, than to be the great fool you look.

A soft answer may turn away wrath, but in a Chancery suit, a soft
answer is only likely to turn the scales against you.

One fortune is remarkably good until you have had another one told you.

Don't halloa until you have got your head safe out of the wood,
particularly at Donnybrook Fair.

       *       *       *       *       *

  [Illustration: _Lady (looking at new cob)._ "How does he go, Patrick?"

  _Irish Groom._ "The very best, m'lady! Sure it's only now and then he
  touches the ground in odd spots."]

       *       *       *       *       *

Men of straw don't make the best bricks.

It's a narrow bed that has no turning.

When money is sent flying out of the window it's poverty that comes in
at the door.

The pig that pleases to live must live to please.

One man may steal a hedge, whereas another daren't even as much as look
at a horse.

Short rents make long friends--and it holds good equally with your
landlord and your clothes.

The mug of a fool is known by there being nothing in it.

You may put the carte before the horse, but you can't make him eat.

Money makes the gentleman, the want of it the blackguard.

When wise men fall out, then rogues come by what is not their own.

A BITTER BAD FRUIT.--A patriotic Irishman, expatiating eloquently upon
the Lodge disturbances that were so repeatedly taking place in his
country, exclaimed wildly: "By Jove, sir, you may call the Orange the
Apple of Discord of Ireland."

THE TALE OF A VOTE


    Bedad, 'twas meself was as plaised as could be
    When they tould me the vote had bin given to me.
    "St. Pathrick," ses Oi, "Oi'm a gintleman too,
    An' Oi'll dine ivry day off a grand Oirish stew."

    The words was scarce seen slippin' off of me tongue
    When who but the Colonel comes walkin' along!
    "Begorrah, 'tis callin' he's afther, the bhoy,
    Oi'm a gintleman now wid a vingeance," ses Oi.

    The Colonel come in wid an affable air,
    An' he sat down quite natteral-loike in a chair.
    "So, Rory," ses he, "'tis a vote ye've got now?"
    "That's thrue though ye ses it," ses Oi, wid a bow.

    "Deloighted!" ses he, "'tis meself that is glad,
    For shure ye're desarvin' it, Rory, me lad.
    An' how are ye goin' to use it?" ses he,
    "Ye could scarcely do betther than give it to me."

    Oi stared at the Colonel, amazed wid surprise.
    "What! Give it away, sorr?--Me vote, sorr?" Oi cries
    "D'ye think that Oi've waited ontil Oi am gray,
    An' now Oi'm jist goin' to give it away?"

    The Colonel he chuckled, an' "Rory," ses he.
    But "No, sorr," Oi answers, "ye don't diddle me."
    Thin he hum'd an' he haw'd, an' he started agin,
    But he'd met wid his equal in Rory O'Flynn.

    Thin the smoile died away, an' a frown come instead,
    But for all that he tould me, Oi jist shook me head,

    [Illustration: NOT QUITE THE SAME THING.--_Merciful Traveller._ "Your
    little horse has been going well. When do you bait him?" _Pat._ "Ah,
    shure, it's been a purty livel road, sor: but Oi'l have to bate him
    goin' up Sloggin Derry Hill, sor!"]

    An' he gnawed his moustache, an' he cursed an' he swore,
    But the more that he argued, Oi shook it the more.

    Thin he called me a dolt an' an ignorant fool,
    An' he said that Oi ought to go back to the school,
    An' he flew in a rage an' wint black in the face,
    An' he flung in a hullaballoo from the place.

    Bedad, Oi was startled. Him beggin' me vote,
    An' he'd three of his own too!--The gradiness o't!
    Ye could scarcely belave it onless it was thrue,
    An' him sittin' oop for a gintleman too!

    Was it betther he thought he could use it than Oi?
    Begorrah, Oi'll show he's mistaken, me bhoy.
    Oi'll hang it oop over me mantelpace shelf,
    For now that Oi've got it, Oi'll kape it meself.

IRISH METEOROLOGY.--There surely must be some constant cause existing

analogous; and, if like cures like, many a happy cure may be effected
by a mad dog biting a rabid Irishman.

RULES FOR HOME-RULERS


The following regulations, to be observed in the Irish Parliament when
it meets on College Green, are under consideration:--

1. The Speaker shall not speak except when he is talking.

2. Such terms as "thief of the wurruld," "spalpeen," "nager,"
"villian," "polthroon," "thraytor," "omadhawn," &c., and such epithets
as "base," "brutal," "bloody-minded," and others named in the schedule
to these regulations, shall be considered unparliamentary, except when
used in the heat of debate.

3. An Annual Budget shall be presented to the House once a quarter.

4. Shilelaghs, revolvers, and pikes, shall not be introduced into the
House, except when accompanied by a Member.

that he would be present were he not ill at home in bed.

be included unless they are sufficiently conscious to utter "Erin go
Bragh!" thrice distinctly.

7. Duels will be strictly forbidden. Should any Member, however, think
proper to break this rule, it will be considered a breach of privilege
if he does not invite the Speaker and the whole House to see the fun.

8. There will be only one Speaker; but two or more Members may be
elected to the post.

9. Only one Member shall address the House at a time, except when two
or more wish to speak at once, in which case they shall not interrupt
each other.

has got it on his head before rising, when he shall remove it on any
Member directing the Speaker's attention to the fact.

11. Under no consideration whatever will the consumption of any spirits
be permitted in the House. This rule does not apply to whiskey, gin,
brandy, and the French liqueurs.

12. As only the most elegant Dublin English will be spoken in the
House, no Provincial brogue can be tolerated. To this rule there will
be no exception.

PRESIDENT PAT


(_From the forthcoming History of Parliament_)

One blow and Ireland sprang from the head of her Saxon enslaver a new
Minerva! Proudly and solemnly she then sat down to frame a Republic
worthy of Plato and Pat. Her first president had been a workhouse
porter and a night watchman. He was, therefore, eminently fitted both
for civil and military administration. The speech of President Pat on
opening Congress develops his policy and his well-digested plans of
legislative reform. Here are a few choice quotations:--

 The key-stone of Government is the blarney stone.

 Political progress may always be accelerated by a bludgeon.

 Our institutions must be consolidated by soft soap and whacks.

 The people's will is made known by manifesto, and by many fists too.


  [Illustration: _Clerk._ "Return?"

  _Pat._ "Phwat for ud Oi be wantin' a returrn ticket when Oi'm here
  already?"]


 Every man shall be qualified to sit in Congress that is a 10 lb.
 pig-holder, provided that the pig and the member sleep under the same
 roof.

 Members of Congress will be remunerated for their public services.
 Gentlemen wearing gloves only to have the privilege of shaking the
 president's hand. The unwashed to be paid at the door.

 Pipes will not be allowed on the Opposition benches, nor may any
 member take whiskey until challenged by the president.

 Under no circumstances will a member be suffered to sit with his
 blunderbuss at full-cock, nor pointed at the president's ear.

 Our ambassadors will be chosen from our most meritorious postmen, so
 that they may have no difficulty in reading their letters.

 The Foreign Office will be presided over by a patriotic editor who has
 travelled in New South Wales and is thoroughly conversant with its
 language.

 Instead of bulwarks, the island will be fortified by Irish bulls; our
 military engineers being of opinion that no other horn-works are so
 efficient or necessary.

 To prevent heart-burnings between landlord and tenant, a Government
 collector of rents will be appointed, and tenant-right shall include a
 power to shoot over the land, and at any one on it.--_Punch_, 1865.

HOW TO MAKE AN IRISH STORY


Lay your scene principally in Galway, and let your chief characters
be the officers of a regiment of Dragoons. Represent them as habitual
drunkards, as duellists, and as practical jokers; but take care to
exclude from their tricks everything like wit. Introduce as frequently
as possible, with the necessary variation only of time, place, and
circumstance, a tipsy brawl, with a table oversetting in the midst of
it, and a ragamuffin with a great stick in his hand, capering thereon.
Do not omit to mention the bottles and glasses that whistle, during
this performance, about his ears, nor the chairs and fire-irons which
are used by the surrounding combatants; and under the table fail not
to place your comic character; for instance, your priest. Upset mail
coaches, and make horses run away with their riders continually: and be
careful, having bribed some clever artist to prostitute his talents,
to have all these intellectually humorous scenes illustrated, in that
your readers may fully appreciate the only jokes they are likely to
understand. Put "an affair of honour" into about every other chapter;
and for the credit and renown of your country, you being an Irishman,
exhibit it as conducted with the most insensate levity. Indeed, in
furtherance of this object, depict your countrymen in general as a set
of irrational, unfeeling, crazy blockheads; only, not having sense
enough to be selfish, as lavish and prodigal in the extreme. Never mind
your plot, but string adventure upon adventure, without sequence or
connexion; just remembering to wind up with a marriage. For example,
your hero may shoot some old gentleman through the head--or hat--and
run away with his niece, an heiress. Whenever you are at a loss for
fun--that is, when you find it impracticable to tumble or knock one
another down--throw yourself on your brogue, and introduce--"Arrah!
now, honey, be aisy." "Long life to yer honour, sure, and didn't I?"
"Is it praties, ye mane?" "Sorrow a bit." "_Musha!_" "_Mavourneen!_"
and the like phrases (having the interjectional ones printed in
italics, that their point may be the more obvious), which you will find
excellent substitutes for wit. Your tale, thus prepared, take it to
some publisher, and let him serve it up monthly to the unintelligent
portion of the public with puff sauce.

PUNCH'S FOLK-LORE

ST. PATRICK'S DAY


The season of spring gives us lamb and violets, salmon and patron
saints. St. David and St. Patrick are commemorated in March, St. George
only waits until April. (Of this last-named saint a very careful notice
has for some time been in preparation, to include six autobiographical
anecdotes of his boyish days, a selection from his unpublished
correspondence with his laundress, and an authentic portrait of his
chief antagonist--the Dragon.)

  [Illustration: SUNDAY AT THE ZOO.--"Excuse me, sorr; but can ye direct
  me to the goin' out intrance?"]

St. Patrick's Day! the heart leaps up with uncontrolled delight, and a
flood of popular airs comes rushing o'er the brain. What reminiscences
of by-gone days invade the territory of the mind! All the population
of Dublin, headed by the Lord-Lieutenant and Ulster King-at-Arms,
abroad at daybreak, looking for four-leaved shamrocks in the Ph[oe]nix
Park, and singing Moore's _Melodies_ in unison; an agreeable mixture
of whiskey and water provided in unlimited quantities in every market
town in Ireland, the expense of the water being defrayed out of
the Consolidated Fund; the Lord Mayor of Dublin presented with a new
shillelagh of polished oak, bound with brass, purchased by the united
contributions of every grown-up citizen bearing the name of Patrick;
the constabulary in new boots; a public dinner on the Blarney Stone,
and a fancy-dress ball on the Wicklow Mountains! These are but a
few of the marks of distinction showered on this memorable day by
Erin's grateful sons and daughters, who owe to St. Patrick two of the
greatest distinctions that ever befell them--freedom from serpents,
snakes, scorpions, efts, newts, tadpoles, chameleons, salamanders,
daddy-long-legs, and all other venomous reptiles, and instruction in
six lessons, in "the true art of mixing their liquor, an art," it has
been well observed, "which has never since been lost."

This leaning of the Saint to potheen is viewed, however, by one section
of the community with manifest displeasure--the Temperance and Teetotal
Societies--who remain indoors the whole of the day with the blinds
closely drawn down and straw in front of their houses, and employ paid
emissaries to distribute tracts amongst their excitable countrymen.

  [Illustration: _Irish porter (thrusting his head into a compartment as
  the train stops at small, dingy, ill-lit country station)._ "Is thur
  annybody there for here?"]

The notorious fact that St. Patrick lived to be considerably more
than a hundred, cut a wisdom tooth at ninety-eight, never had a day's
illness in his life, was possessed of funded property, and could see
to read without spectacles until within six weeks of his untimely end
(caused by a fall from a cherry tree), speaks libraries for the tonic
and salubrious qualities of that stimulating spirit, which has ever
since his day been known and highly appreciated under the name of
"L.L.," or Long Livers' Whiskey.

A curious custom is kept up by the Knights of the Order of St. Patrick
(founded by King Brian Boroo the Fourteenth) on the morning of this
day, the origin of which is lost among the wilds of Connemara. Before
it is light the Knights all go up in their robes and shamrocks, one
by one, into the belfry of the Cathedral, and toll the great bell one
hundred and twenty-three times, the exact number of years to which the
Saint, in forgetfulness of Sir George Cornwall Lewis and the Editor of
_Notes and Queries_, is said to have attained. They then parade the
principal streets of Dublin on piebald horses, preceded by a band of
music and the Law Officers of the Crown, and disperse at a moment's
notice, no one knows where.

  [Illustration: GRANDILOQUENCE.--_Captain of schooner._ "What 'a' you

St. Patrick's tastes were athletic. He had a wart on his forehead, and
a cousin in the militia; and displayed a profound acquaintance with the
laws of short whist, then in its infancy. He was an early riser, a deep
thinker, and a careless dresser, and foresaw, with an eagle glance, the
gradual development of the railway system, while his declining years
were soothed by the devoted attentions of some of the oldest families
in Ireland.

NEW BULLS _v._ OLD COWS.--At the Thames Police Court Mr. Benson

a warning to all whom it may concern, that though new Irish bulls may
be introduced freely, and even be relished in this country, there is no
toleration for old Irish cows on this side St. George's Channel.

THE ROYAL VISIT TO IRELAND


No doubt some of our readers have been, at one time or another, in
Ireland, especially those who were born there. It is hoped, however,
that the following notes may be of some value to those whose attention
has now for the first time been attracted to this country by the King's
visit.

Many, however, will remember that not very long ago Ireland was the
scene of perhaps the most bloodless and humane motor-car encounters of
modern times.

The inhabitants of the island (who consist of men, women, and children
of both sexes) are full of native character. They are generally fond of
animals, especially pigs and "bulls." These latter wear what is known
as a Celtic fringe on the forehead.

The principal exports are emigrants, M.P.s, shamrocks, Dublin
Fusiliers, Field Marshals, real lace, and cigars.

A full list of "Previous Royal Visits to Ireland and other Countries"
will be found in another column of some other paper.

  [Illustration: _Irish Chambermaid (indignantly, to gay Lothario who has
  tried to snatch a kiss and been foiled)._ "Ye dare! If it wasn't for
  soilin' me hands wid ye I'd kick ye downstairs!"]

Dublin is the capital of the country, and is pronounced very much like
the English word "doubling," with the final "g" omitted.

The tourist will find the language difficulty comparatively easy, as
English is now spoken in most of the large shops.

A few phrases, such as "Erin go bragh," "Begorra ye spalpeen," "Acushla
mavourneen," &c., are easily learnt, and the trouble involved is amply
repaid in the simple joy of the natives on hearing a foreigner speak
their own language.

  [Illustration: PROOF

  _Master._ "Pat, I must say you're very contradictory."

  _Pat (emphatically)._ "I am not, sorr!"]

English gold is accepted in Ireland, and the rate of exchange works
out at twenty shillings to the sovereign. Two sixpences will always be
accepted in lieu of a shilling.

N.B.--To avoid disappointment to naturalists and others we think it
right to mention that since the late raid of St. Patrick there are no
snakes of first-rate quality in Ireland.

 is engaged in breaking the speech limit."

HOW FATHER O'SHEE LAID IN HIS CHRISTMAS COALS


    Young Patsy Molloy was as purty a boy
    As was ever of widdy the pride and the joy;
    And as for his ass, sorra crather could pass
    That beautiful baste, but for one fault, alas!
    When she felt she'd a load, you might kick and might goad,
    But divil a fut would she move on the road,
    Till you'd tickle her bones wid a handful of stones--
    And _that_ hint she'd take, the desateful ould toad!

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Widdy, half dead with could, looked in the shed,
    But sorra the peat could she find; so she said,
    "Sure I'm clane out of few'l, and the could is that crew'l;
    Take the baste for a load of Wallsends, Pat, my jew'l!"

  [Illustration: Pat with donkey cart talking to the Widdy]

           *       *       *       *       *

    Pat went, filled his cart, and for home made a start,
    But the baste wid her tantrums well-nigh bruk his heart
    For never a stip would she move, the ould rip!
    But she stood like a pig wid her legs wide apart.
    "Ochone! wirra-'sthrue! Arrah, what will I do?"
    Cried Pat, as he sat in a terrible stew.

  [Illustration: Pat with loaded donkey cart, donkey being stubborn]

    Then he called on the Saints, and he called on the d----
    (I won't say the word--sure it wouldn't be civil!)
    When, as good luck would be, by strowls Father Shee,
    And he says, "My son Patsy! my son Pat!" says he,
    '"Sich language is really shocking to me.
    Sure, what is the matther?" "The matther!" says Pat
    "Now, saving your prisence, by this and by that!
    The murthering brute will not budge--not a fut."

    Says the Priest, "Why not bate her?" Oh wasn't he cute!
    "Is it batin'?" says Pat. "By the Saint in my hat!
    'Tisn't batin' she cares for--bad luck to the slut!
    Ochone and ochone! if I'd only a stone----!"
    "A stone!" says the Priest--ah thin, wasn't he artful?--
    "A stone! Why, ye omadhaun, look at yer cartfull!"

  [Illustration: Pat with loaded donkey cart talking to Priest]

    "Thrue for you!" Pat sings out; "them's the jockeys'll do,"
    And clutching two handsful with joyous "Hurroo,"
    He let fly in haste at the back of his baste,
    That not likin' the taste, started off as if chased
    By the ould one himself, for a good rood or two.
    But Pat knew the thrick, and whenever she'd kick,
    Or stop in her canther, the coals would fall thick
    On her ribs and her back, till the road was asthrew
    Wid best Wallsends, and Patsy's poor baste black and blue!

       *       *       *       *       *

  [Illustration: Donkey galloping, cart now empty]

    Ten minutes, and cute Father Shee you'd have seen,
    Wid his shovel and crate, and his purty colleen.
    And he says, "Colleen dhas, sure 'tis wicked to pass
    The good things that's sent, though they're brought by an
    ass.

  [Illustration: Colleen with shovel and Priest]

    D'ye see them black diamonds? It's elegant coal--
    Shovel up every lump, if you vally your soul!"

       *       *       *       *       *

    As for Pat and the widdy--I will not be guessing
    What _he_ got--but I'll go bail 't wasn't a blessing!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
