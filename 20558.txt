INTRODUCTION


For modern readers, one of the most intriguing scenes in Daniel Defoe's
_Moll Flanders_ (1722) occurs during the courtship of Moll by the man
who is to become her third husband. Aware that the eligible men of her
day have little interest in prospective wives with small or nonexistent
fortunes, Moll slyly devises a plan to keep her relative poverty a
secret from the charming and (as she has every reason to believe)
wealthy plantation owner who has fallen in love with her. To divert
attention from her own financial condition, she repeatedly suggests that
he has been courting her only for her money. Again and again he protests
his love. Over and over she pretends to doubt his sincerity.

After a series of exhausting confrontations, Moll's lover begins what is
to us a novel kind of dialogue:

  One morning he pulls off his diamond ring and writes upon the glass
  of the sash in my chamber this line:

          You I love and you alone.

  I read it and asked him to lend me the ring, with which I wrote under
  it thus:

          And so in love says every one.

  He takes his ring again and writes another line thus:

          Virtue alone is an estate.

  I borrowed it again, and I wrote under it:

          But money's virtue, gold is fate.[1]

After a number of additional thrusts and counterthrusts of this sort,
Moll and her lover come to terms and are married.

  [Footnote 1: Daniel Defoe, _Moll Flanders_ (New York: New American
  Library, 1964), pp. 71-72.]

The latter half of the twentieth century has seen a steady growth of
serious scholarly interest in graffiti. Sociologists, psychologists, and
historians have increasingly turned to the impromptu "scratchings" of
both the educated and the uneducated as indicators of the general mental
health and political stability of specific populations.[2] Although most
of us are familiar with at least a few of these studies and all of us
have observed numerous examples of this species of writing on the walls
of our cities and the rocks of our national parks, we are not likely,
before encountering this scene in _Moll Flanders_, to have ever before
come into contact with graffiti produced with such an elegant writing
implement.

  Wall," _History Today_, 19 (1969), 419-423, and "Graffiti,"

  Sociology and Psychology of Graffiti_ (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood
  Press, 1977); and Marina N. Haan and Richard B. Hammerstrom,
  _Graffiti in the Ivy League_ (New York: Warner Books, 1981).]

Glass being fragile and diamonds being relatively rare, it is not
surprising that few examples of graffiti produced by the method employed
by Moll and her lover are known to us today. Interestingly enough, we
do, however, have available to us a variety of Renaissance and
eighteenth-century written materials suggesting that the practice of
using a diamond to write ephemeral statements on window glass was far
less rare in those periods than we might expect. Holinshed, for example,
tells us that in 1558 when Elizabeth was released from imprisonment at
Woodstock, she taunted her enemies by writing

  these verses with hir diamond in a glasse window verie legiblie as
  here followeth:

    Much suspected by me,
    Nothing prooued can be:
    Quoth Elizabeth prisoner.[3]

  [Footnote 3: _Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and
  Ireland_ (London, 1808), IV, 133.]

And in John Donne's "A Valediction: of my Name in the Window," we find
two lovers in a situation reminiscent of that of the scene I previously
quoted from _Moll Flanders_. Using a diamond, the poet, before beginning
an extended journey, scratches his name on a window pane in the house of
his mistress. Here is the first stanza of the poem:

        My name engrav'd herein,
    Doth contribute my firmnesse to this glasse,
        Which, ever since that charme, hath beene
        As hard, as that which grav'd it, was;
    Thine eyes will give it price enough, to mock
        The diamonds of either rock.[4]

While he is absent, the characters he has cut in the glass will, the
poet hopes, magically defend his mistress against the seductive
entreaties of his rivals.

  [Footnote 4: John Donne, _The Elegies and the Songs and Sonnets_,
  ed. Helen Gardner (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1966), p. 64.]

In 1711 in a satiric letter to _The Spectator_, John Hughes poked fun at
a number of aspiring poets who had recently attempted to create works of
art by utilizing what Hughes called "Contractions or Expedients for
Wit." One Virtuoso (a mathematician) had, for example, "thrown the Art
of Poetry into a short Problem, and contrived Tables by which any one
without knowing a Word of Grammar or Sense, may to his great Comfort, be
able to compose or rather erect _Latin_ Verses." Equally ridiculous to
Hughes, and more relevant to the concerns of this introduction, was the
practice of another poet of his acquaintance: "I have known a Gentleman
of another Turn of Humour, who, despising the Name of an Author, never
printed his Works, but contracted his Talent, and by the help of a very
fine Diamond which he wore on his little Finger, was a considerable Poet
upon Glass. He had a very good Epigrammatick Wit; and there was not a
Parlour or Tavern Window where he visited or dined ... which did not
receive some Sketches or Memorials of it. It was his Misfortune at last
to lose his Genius and his Ring to a Sharper at Play; and he has not
attempted to make a Verse since."[5]

  [Footnote 5: _The Spectator_, No. 220, November 12, 1711.]

But "Epigrammatick Wits" of this sort were not universally despised in
the eighteenth century. In 1727 in a "critical dissertation prefix'd" to
_A Collection of Epigrams_, the anonymous editor of the work argued that
the epigram itself "is a species of Poetry, perhaps, as old as any other
whatsoever: it has receiv'd the approbation of almost all ages and
nations...." In the book proper, he found room for a number of epigrams
which he evidently copied from London window panes. Here is an example:

  CLX.

  _To a Lady, on seeing some Verses in Praise of her, on a Pane of
  Glass._

      Let others, brittle beauties of a year,
      See their frail names, and lovers vows writ here;
      Who sings thy solid worth and spotless fame,
      On purest adamant should cut thy name:
      Then would thy fame be from oblivion sav'd;
      On thy own heart my vows must be engrav'd.

One of the epigrams in this collection suggests that, unlike Moll's
lover and Hughes's poet, some affluent authors had even acquired
instruments specifically designed to facilitate the practice of writing
poetry on glass:

  _Written on a Glass by a Gentleman, who borrow'd the Earl of
  _CHESTERFIELD_'s Diamond Pencil._

      Accept a miracle, instead of _wit_;
      See two dull lines by _Stanhope's_ pencil writ.[6]

  [Footnote 6: No. CCCLXXXII, in _A Collection of Epigrams. To Which
  Is Prefix'd, a Critical Dissertation on This Species of Poetry_
  (London, 1727).]

As the title of this epigram also suggests, window panes were not the
only surfaces considered appropriate for such writing. A favorite
alternate surface was that of the toasting glass. The practice of
toasting the beauty of young ladies had originated at the town of Bath
during the reign of Charles II. By the beginning of the eighteenth
century, the members of some social clubs had developed complex toasting
rituals which involved the inscription of the name of the lady to be
honored on a drinking glass suitable for that purpose. In 1709 an issue
of _The Tatler_ described the process in some detail:

  that happy virgin, who is received and drunk to at their meetings,
  has no more to do in this life but to judge and accept of the first
  good offer. The manner of her inauguration is much like that of the
  choice of a doge in Venice: it is performed by balloting; and when
  she is so chosen, she reigns indisputably for that ensuing year; but
  must be elected a-new to prolong her empire a moment beyond it. When
  she is regularly chosen, her name is written with a diamond on a
  drinking-glass.[7]

  [Footnote 7: _The Tatler_, No. 24, June 4, 1709.]

Perhaps the most famous institution practicing this kind of ceremony in
the eighteenth century was the Kit-Kat Club. In 1716 Jacob Tonson,
a member of that club, published "Verses Written for the
Toasting-Glasses of the Kit-Kat Club" in the fifth part of his
_Miscellany_. Space limitations will not permit extensive quotations
from this collection, but the toast for Lady Carlisle is alone
sufficient to prove that complete epigrams were at times engraved upon
the drinking glasses belonging to this club:

    She o'er all Hearts and Toasts must reign,
    Whose Eyes outsparkle bright Champaign;
    Or (when she will vouchsafe to smile,)
    The Brilliant that now writes _Carlisle_.[8]

Part I of _The Merry-Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-House
Miscellany_ was almost certainly published for the first time in 1731.
Arthur E. Case (_Bibliography of English Poetical Miscellanies_,
1521-1750) notes that this pamphlet was listed in the register of books
in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for October 1731.[9] An instant success
with the reading public, second and third editions of the pamphlet, the
third "with very Large Additions and Alterations," were also published
in 1731.[10] Because, as its title-page declared, the third and last
edition was the fullest of the three, a copy of that edition has been
chosen for reproduction here.[11]

  [Footnote 8: _The Fifth Part of Miscellany Poems_, ed. Jacob Tonson
  (London, 1716), p. 63.]

  [Footnote 9: _A Bibliography of English Poetical Miscellanies,
  1521-1750_ (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1935), p. 275.]

  [Footnote 10: Case, p. 276, points out that the second edition was
  advertised in the November 13, 1731, issue of _Fog's Weekly Journal_
  and that the third edition was advertised in the December 11, 1731,
  issue of the same journal. Three additional parts were also
  published within a year or so, see Case, pp. 276-277.]

  [Footnote 11: Although, as the title-page of the third edition
  advertises, the third edition does contain materials not to be found
  in the second edition, it does not indicate that the second edition
  itself contained materials omitted from the third edition. Among the
  materials not reprinted were the following verses:

    _Red-Lyon_ at _Stains_.

      My Dear _Nancy P---k---r_
      I sigh for her, I wish for her,
      I pray for her. Alas! it is a Plague
      That _Cupid_ will impose, for my Neglect
      Of his Almighty, Dreadful, Little Might.
      Well, will I love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan
      Ah! where shall I make my Moan!
        _T. S._ 1709.

    _John Crumb_, a Bailiff, as he was carrying to his Grave,
    occasioned the following Piece to be written upon a Window in
    _Fleet-Street_, _1706_.

      Here passes the Body of _John Crumb_,
      When living was a Baily-Bum
      T'other Day he dy'd,
      And the Devil he cry'd,
      Come _Jack_, come, come.

    In the _Tower_.

      Though Guards surround me Day and Night,
      Let _Celia_ be but in my Sight,
      And then they need not fear my Flight.
        L. N. & G. ]

The title-page of Part I of _The Merry-Thought_ states that the contents
of the pamphlet had been taken from "Original Manuscripts written in
_Diamond_ by Persons of the first Rank and Figure in _Great Britain_"
and that they had been "Faithfully Transcribed from the Drinking-Glasses
and Windows in the several noted _Taverns_, _Inns_, and other _Publick
Places_ in this Nation. Amongst which are intermixed the Lucubrations of
the polite Part of the World, written upon Walls in Bog-houses, _&c._"
These statements suggest one of the principal leveling strategies of the
pamphlet as a whole: the nobility and the rich, whatever their
advantages otherwise, must, like the lowest amongst us, make use of
privies; and, in the process, they are just as likely as their brethren
of the lower classes to leave their marks on the walls of those
conveniences.

A number of the verses included in the pamphlet continue the leveling
process. One in particular (p. 20) adopts the principal strategy
employed on the title-page:

  _From the Temple Bog-House._

    No Hero looks so fierce to Fight,
    As does the Man who strains to sh-te.

Others suggest that sexual relations are essentially leveling
activities. Here (p. 24) is an example:

  _Toy, at Hampton-Court_, 1708.

    D---n _Molley H---ns_ for her Pride,
    She'll suffer none but Lords to ride:
    But why the Devil should I care,
    Since I can find another Mare?

      _L. M. August._

Another target of the pamphlet was _The Spectator_ in general and
Addison in particular. In his dedication, J. Roberts first insists that
the graffiti in his collection are notable examples of wit.[12] He next
goes out of his way to associate the contents of _The Merry-Thought_
with _The Spectator_:

  _But I may venture to say, That good Things are not always respected
  as they ought to be: The People of the World will sometimes overlook
  a Jewel, to avoid a T--d.... Nay, I have even found some of the
  _Spectator's_ Works in a Bog-house, Companions with Pocky-Bills and
  Fortune-telling Advertisements...._

  [Footnote 12: Roberts was almost certainly the collector of the
  graffiti printed in _The Merry-Thought_ as well as the author of the
  dedication, but the dedication was itself signed with the name
  "Hurlo Thrumbo." Similarly, the title-page listed Hurlo Thrumbo as
  the publisher of the work. In 1729 _Hurlothrumbo: or, The
  Super-Natural_, a play by a half-mad dancer and fiddler, Samuel
  Johnson of Cheshire (1691-1773), had set all of London talking. The
  irrational, amusing speeches and actions of Hurlothrumbo, the play's
  title-character, gained instant fame, and two years later Roberts,
  by attributing his collection to the labors of that celebrity, had
  every reason to expect that the book would attract immediate
  attention. For a detailed account of the relationship between
  Johnson's play and _The Merry-Thought_, see George R. Guffey,
  "Graffiti, Hurlo Thrumbo, and the Other Samuel Johnson," in _Forum:
  A Journal of the Humanities and Fine Arts_ (University of Houston),
  XVII (1979), 35-47.]

In a series of essays in _The Spectator_ (Nos. 58-61; May, 1711),
Addison had earlier, of course, been at pains to distinguish between
"true wit" and "false wit." Particularly abhorrent to him was the rebus.
The first part of _The Merry-Thought_ alone contains seven rebuses from
"_Drinking-Glasses, at a private Club of Gentlemen_" (pp. 12-13), as
well as several examples of other kinds of "wit" which Addison would
have disdained.

During the twenty-five years that followed the publication of the
_Merry-Thought_ series, a few additional pieces of graffiti were
published in England and America.[13] In 1761 _The New Boghouse
Miscellany_ appeared, but the contents of this book had little in common
with the _Merry-Thought_ pamphlets. Only the scatological humor of the
subtitle:

  _A Companion for the Close-stool._ Consisting of Original Pieces in
  Prose and Verse by several Modern Authors. Printed on an excellent
  soft Paper; and absolutely necessary for all those, who read with a
  View to Convenience, as well as Delight. Revised and corrected by
  a Gentleman well skilled in the Fundamentals of Literature, near
  Privy-Garden

and the generally anti-intellectual thrust of its preface were
reminiscent of the _Merry-Thought_ pamphlets. Not until the last half of
the twentieth century would the graffito in English receive the kind of
attention that had been paid it in England in the 1730s.

  Honourable and Worthy Authors
  of the following Curious Pieces.

  Gentlemen and Ladies,

_Would it not be great Pity, that the profound Learning and Wit of so
many illustrious Personages, who have favoured the Publick with their
Lucubrations in Diamond Characters upon _Drinking-Glasses_, on
_Windows_, on _Walls_, and in _Bog-houses_, should be left to the World?
Consider only, Gentlemen and Ladies, how many Accidents might rob us of
these sparkling Pieces, if the industrious Care of the Collector had not
taken this Way of preserving them, and handing them to Posterity. In the
first Place, some careless Drawer breaks the Drinking-Glasses inscribed
to the Beauties of our Age; a furious Mob at an Election breaks the
Windows of a contrary Party; and a cleanly Landlord must have, forsooth,
his Rooms new painted and white-wash'd every now and then, without
regarding in the least the Wit and Learning he is obliterating, or the
worthy Authors, any more than when he shall have their Company: But I
may venture to say, That good Things are not always respected as they
ought to be: The People of the World will sometimes overlook a Jewel, to
avoid a T--d, though the Proverb says, _Sh - tt - n Luck is good Luck_.
Nay, I have even found some of the _Spectator_'s Works in a Bog-house,
Companion with Pocky-Bills and Fortune-telling Advertisements; but now,
as Dr. _R----ff_ said, _You shall live_; and I dare venture to affirm,
no Body shall pretend to use any of your bright Compositions for
Bum-Fodder, but those who pay for them. I am not in this like many other
Publishers, who make the Works of other People their own, without
acknowledging the Piracy they are guilty of, or so much as paying the
least Complement to the Authors of their Wisdom: No, Gentlemen and
Ladies, I am not the Daw in the Fable, that would vaunt and strut in
your Plumes. And besides, I know very well you might have me upon the
Hank according to Law, and treat me as a Highwayman or Robber; for you
might safely swear upon your Honours, that I had stole the whole Book
from your recreative Minutes. But I am more generous; I am what you may
call Frank and Free; I acknowledge them to be _YOURS_, and now publish
them to perpetuate the Memory of your Honours Wit and Learning: But as
every one must have something of Self in him, I am violently flattered,
that my Character will shine like the Diamonds you wrote with, under
your exalted Protection, to the End of Time. I am not like your common
Dedicators, who fling out their Flourishes for the sake of a Purse of
Guineas on their Dedicatees; No, Gentlemen and Ladies, all I desire is,
that you will receive this kindly, though I have not put Cuts to it, and
communicate what sublime Thoughts you may chance to meet with to the
Publisher, _J. Roberts_, in _Warwick-Lane_, Post paid, for_

  Your Most Humble,

  Whilst Lady _Mary_ slept at Ease,
  Secure from Jealousy and Fleas,
  Her Lord with vig'rous Love inclin'd,
  To kiss her Maid, and ease his Mind:
  The Maiden did not long resist,
  But gently yielded to be kist;
  And in the Dance of Lovers move,
  With sprightly Bounds to shew her Love.
  When in the Height of am'rous Fire,
  She cry'd, my Lord, I've one Desire,
  Tell me, my Peer, tell me, my Lord,
  Tell me, my Life, upon your Word,
  Who does it best, my Dame or me?
  And then she fell in Extasy.
  My Lord in Fire of his Love,
  Call'd her his Minion, Turtle Dove;
  You have the only Art to please,
  All this he swore upon his Knees:
  Your Dame is like a Log of Wood,
  Her Love is never half so good.
  My Lord, says she, all that I know;
  For all the World has told me so.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
