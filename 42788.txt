PREDICTIONS OF THE FIRE AND PLAGUE OF LONDON, NO. II.

One of the most striking predictions occurs in Daniel Baker's _Certaine
Warning for a Naked Heart_, Lond. 1659. After much invective against the
evil ways of the metropolis, he proceeds:

    "A fire, a consuming fire, shall be kindled in the bowels of the earth,
    which will scorch with burning heat all hypocrites, unstable,
    double-minded workers of iniquity.... A great and large slaughter shall
    be throughout the land of darkness where the unrighteous decrees and
    laws have been founded. Yea, a great effusion of blood, fire, and smoke
    shall encrease up in the dark habitations of cruelty; howling and great
    wailing shall be on every hand in all her streets."

Thomas Ellwood disposes of the city in a very summary manner:

    "For this shall be judgment of Babylon (saith the Lord); in one day
    shall her plagues come upon her, _death_, and _mourning_, and famine,
    and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; for great is the Lord who
    judgeth her."--_Alarm to the Priests_, Lond. 1662.

George Fox also claims to have had a distinct prevision of the fire (See
_Journal_, p. 386., ed 1765.) He also relates the story of a Quaker who was
moved to come out of Huntingdonshire a little before the fire, and to--

    "Scatter his money up and down the streets, turn his horse loose, untie
    the knees of his breeches, and let his stockings fall down, and to tell
    the people 'so they should run up and down scattering their money and
    goods, half undressed, like mad people, as he was a sign to them,'
    which they did when the city was burning."

Lilly's celebrated book of _Hieroglyphicks_, which procured the author the
dubious honour of an examination before the committee appointed to inquire
into the origin of the fire, is well known. In one of the plates, a large
city, understood to denote London, is enveloped in flames; and another rude
woodcut, containing a large amount of graves and corpses, was afterwards
interpreted to bear reference to the Plague. Aubrey seems to be a {174}
little jealous of the renown which Lilly acquired by these productions for
he asserts that--

    "Mr. Thomas Flatman (poet) did affirm that he had seen those
    _Hieroglyphicks_ in an old parchment manuscript, writ in the time of
    the monks."--_Misc._, p. 125. ed. 1721.

Nostradamus also, more than a century before, is said to have foretold the
very year of the burning. In the edition, or reputed edition, of 1577,
cent. ii. quatrain 51., is the following:

 "Le sang du jusse a Londres fera faute
  Bruslez par foudres de vingt trois les six
  La dame anticque cherra de place haute
  De mesme secte plusieurs seront occis."

Those of your readers who incline to dubiety on this subject, I refer to
the copy from whence it was taken, in the Museum Library, press-mark 718. a
14. If it is a forgery (and such I take it to be), it is decidedly the best
I ever met with. Some time ago the Queries of your correspondent SPERIEND
elicited some interesting particulars relative to Nostradamus and his
prophecies; but I do not think the question of his claim to having
predicted the death of Charles I. was finally decided.

I should be glad if any of your correspondents could tell me whether the
quatrain above, or anything like it, occurs in any of the _genuine_ early
editions. Dugdale, by the way, evidently believed in its authenticity, and
has inserted a version in his _History of St. Paul's_.

Such a promising theme as the destruction of London was, of course, too
good a thing to escape the chap-book makers. During the period of the Civil
Wars, we find many allusions to it. In a little quarto brochure, published
in 1648, entitled _Twelve Strange Prophecies_, the following is placed in
the mouth of the much maligned and caricatured Mrs. Ann Shipton. The
characteristic termination I consider a fine stroke of the art
vaticinatory.

    "A ship shall come sayling up the Thames till it come to London, and
    the master of the ship shall weep, and the mariners shall ask him why
    he weepeth, and he shall say, 'Ah, what a goodly city was this! none in
    the world comparable to it! and now there is scarce left any house
    _that can let us have drinke for our money_.'"

This string of notes, turned up at different times, and while in search of
more important matter, can no doubt be materially increased from the
collections of your correspondents. If my researches prove interesting, I
may trouble you with another paper: at present I leave the facts brought
together above to the candid investigation of your readers.

EXAMPLES OF THE FRENCH SIZAIN.

The epigram (if it may with propriety receive that appellation) printed in
Vol. vi., p. 603., reminded me of some similar pieces of composition stored
in my note-book; and as they are not devoid of a certain degree of curious
interest, I now forward them _pro bono publico_.

On Luther, Calvin, and Henry VIII., the leaders of the Reformation:

 "Vous, dont le sens est encore sain,
  Fuyez Luther, Henri, Calvin.
  Vous, dont le coeur n'est point fletri,
  Fuyez Calvin, Luther, Henri.
  Vous, a qui le salut est cher,
  Fuyez Henri, Calvin, Luther."

On the death of Francis II.:

 "Par l'oeil, par l'oreille, et l'epaule,
  Trois rois sont morts naguere en Gaule;
  Par l'epaule, l'oreille, et l'oeil,
  Trois rois son entres au cercueil;
  Par l'epaule, l'oeil, et l'oreille,
  Dieu a montre grande merveille."

By Beaumarchais:

 "Connaissez-vous rien de plus sot
  Que Merlin, Bazire, et Chabot?
  Non, certes, il n'est rien de pire
  Que Chabot, Merlin, et Bazire;
  Et nul ne vit-on plus coquin
  Que Chabot, Bazire, et Merlin."

A more modern one still, date 1842:

 "L'Etat est fort mal attele
  Avec Thiers, Guizot, ou Mole;
  L'Etat marche tout de travers,
  Avec Mole, Guizot, ou Thiers;
  Vers l'abime il court a galop,
  Avec Mole, Thiers, ou Guizot."

The prophecy in the last two lines has been unfortunately fulfilled.

EPIGRAMS.

The two epigrams which follow were communicated to me many years ago by the
Rev. George Loggin, M.A., of Hertford College, long one of the masters of
Rugby School. He died July 15, 1824, at the age of forty; and this
reminiscence of their old tutor's name will be welcomed by many a Rugbaean.
They were represented to have proceeded from the pen of Thomas Dunbar of
Brasenose, who, from 1815 to 1822, was keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. I
have never seen them in print, or even in writing. They were recited
_memoriter_, and from memory I write them down; and hence, no doubt, there
will be some deviations from the true text. But they seem too good to be
lost; and I am not {175} without hope that a correct copy may eventually be
elicited from some of your correspondents.

With regard to the first, whether the lines were really made on the
occasion stated, or the occasion was invented (as I am inclined to suspect)
to suit the lines, is perhaps not very material:

 "_Reply to Miss Charlotte Ness, who inquired the meaning_
  _of the logical terms_ ABSTRACT _and_ CONCRETE.

 "'Say what is _Abstract_, what _Concrete_?
    Their difference define.'
 'They both in one fair person meet,
    And that, dear maid, is thine.'

 'How so? The riddle pray undo.'
   'I thus your wish express;
  For when I lovely Charlotte view,
    I then view loveli-_Ness_.'"

On a certain D.D. (who, from a peculiarity in his walk, had acquired the
_sobriquet_ of Dr. Toe) being jilted by Miss H----, who eloped with her
father's footman:

 "'Twixt Footman Sam and Doctor Toe
    A controversy fell,
  Which should prevail against his foe,
    And bear away the belle.
  The lady chose the footman's heart.
    Say, who can wonder? no man:
  The whole prevail'd above the part,
   'Twas _Foot_-man _versus_ _Toe_-man."

I should like to ascertain the author of the following:

  _The Parson_ versus _Physician_.

 "How D.D. swaggers--M.D. rolls!
    I dub them both a brace of noddies:--
  Old D.D. takes the cure of souls,
    And M.D. takes the care of bodies.
  Between them both what treatment rare
    Our souls and bodies must endure!
  One takes the _cure_ without the _care_,
    T'other the _care_ without the _cure_."

GOE, SOULE, THE BODIES GUEST."

I have a cotemporaneous MS. of this wonderfully-fine poem, that came into
my possession with a certain rare bunch of black-letter ballads, printed
between the years 1559 and 1597, and all of them unique (of the said bunch,
Mr. Editor, more hereafter), which contains two additional verses not to be
found in _A Poetical Rhapsodie_, compiled by Francis Davison, and "printed
by William Stansby for Roger Jackson, dwelling in Fleet Street, neere the
great Conduit, 1611;" nor in _Poems by Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Walter
Raleigh, and others_, carefully edited by the Rev. John Hannah, M.A., and
published by my friend William Pickering in 1845. They are prefaced by the
word "Additions." They are written on the same leaf, and in the same quaint
hand, and are as follow:

  Tell London of their stewes,
    Tell marchants of their usury;
  And, though it be no newes,
    Tell courtyers of theyr lechery;
  And if they will reply,
    They best deserve the lye.

  Let cuckolds be remembred,
    I will not dye theyr debtor;
  Theire heads beying armed,
    Theyl beare the brunt the better;
  And if they chaunce reply,
    Theyr wives know best they lye.

Having compared this MS. with the poem as it is printed in the
above-mentioned volumes (both of which are in my library), I find it
contains several variations, not however very important. Though these
"Additions," in good taste, expression, and power, do not equal the noble
verses that precede them, they are interesting and curious, and well worthy
of preservation. After much inspection and inquiry, I have not discovered
that they have ever yet appeared in print. The cabinet in which they slept,
and the company they kept (undisturbed, it would appear) for more than two
centuries, assure me that they have not been published.

If you, Mr. Editor, or any of your many friends desire to see this MS., say
so, and you and they shall be welcome. It has been in my possession
(unseen) twenty years.

PETITIONS FROM THE COUNTY OF NOTTINGHAM.

The documents, copies of which I inclose, are written on the blank leaves
in a copy of Willett's _Hexapla_, edit. 1611. I should be glad to know if
the petitions, of which they are drafts, or rather copies, were presented,
and _when_? There is no date to the petitions; but the copy of a letter, on
another blank page, which seems to be in the same handwriting (signed
"William Middleton"), is dated February 5th, 1658. Any information
regarding the parties whose names are appended to the petitions would be
acceptable.

        "To his Highness the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England,
        Scotland, and Ireland, and the dominions and territories thereunto
        belonging, the humble Address and Petition of diuers Justices of
        the Peace, Gentlemen, Ministers of the Gospell, and others,
        wel-affected persons, inhabitants in the County of Nottingham.

    "Upon consideration of the signall and glorious appearances of God on
    the behalfe of his people and interest, wherein he hath pleased to make
    great use of your Highness, we account ourselues deeply engaged to
    acknowledge the wonderfull power, wisdome, and {176} goodness of God,
    and to ascribe the glory to him alone, yet would we not be found
    ingratefull to your Highness, as an eminent instrument under God of the
    peace and liberty we have injoyed, with a continued series of manifold
    mercies from the Lord, under your Highness' gouernment (notwithstanding
    all our declensions and unworthynesses), together with the influence it
    hath had upon the nations abroad to the promoteing of the Protestant
    interest, we judge it alsoe exceedingly remarkable that the Lord hath
    so signally blasted the pernicious designes of the common enemy against
    your Highness' person and gouernment, and against the common interest
    of the people of God and of these nations, for which we desire
    unfeignedly to bless the Lord.

        "These things premised, we humbly pray,

    "That the Lord would please to stir up the heart and strengthen the
    hands of your Highness, in carrying on what yet remains for the
    reforming of these nations (according to the word of God) and the
    secureing of the interest of godlyness and righteousness for the
    future, that such as are found in the faith and of holy conversation
    may live peaceably, and receive encouragement to persevere in that upon
    which the Lord may delight to doe your Highness and these nations good;
    in order whereunto we humbly propose these following particulars to
    your Highness' consideration:

    "1. First, that a stop may be put to the spreading infection of
    damnable errors and heresies, by a lively and due suppressing of them
    according to the mind of the Lord.

    "2. That an effectuall course may be taken for the curbeing of all
    profaneness and libertineisme by the sword of justice, which the Lord
    hath put into your magistrates' hands.

    "3. That your Highness would haue an eye upon the designes of the
    common enemy in generall, and particularly on this (vid.), their
    traininge up a young generation in the old destructive principles, as
    also on the designes of any persons whatsoeuer that indeauour to
    disturb your Highness' gouernment and the peace of these nations.

    "4. That the lawes of the nation may be reuised, that for what in them
    is agreeable to the rules of righteousness may be continued and
    executed, and whatever corruption is crept into, or may grow up in,
    courts of judicature may be duly purged away.

    "5. That in your Highness' lifetime such prouision be made for the
    future gouernment of the commonwealth, as may secure the interest of
    good people of these nations for succeeding generations, that they may
    call you blessed.

    "And in the prosecution of such ends we shall be ready, as the Lord
    shall help us, with all that is dear to us, to defend your Highness'
    person and gouernment, with the true interest of religion and the
    lawes, and shall ever pray, &c.

    "_To the honourable the Parliament of England._

        "The humble Petition of diuers Gentlemen, Ministers of the Gospell,
        and others, inhabiteing in the County of Nottingham,

        "Sheweth,

    "That your petitioners, haueing seriously considered how much of a
    thorough reformation of religion and pure administration of the
    ordinances of Christianity would tend to the honour of God, the good of
    soules, and the abundant satisfaction of the truly godly in this
    nation, who have long waited for these mercies as the return of their
    prayers, and the fruit of their expense both of blood and treasure, and
    being alsoe very sensible that the duty we owe to God, the eminent and
    signall mercies of God towards this nation, and our own solemn
    engagements, doe strongly oblidge us euery one in our places, to the
    utmost of our power, to indeauour the promoteing and aduancement of
    pure gospell worship, we are humbly bold to address ourselues to your
    honors.

    "We are not undmindfull of, nor would we be unthankfull for, what hath
    been indeauoured this way by former Parliaments, yet we cannot but
    sadly resent the many obstructions this work hath hitherto met withall,
    and how much it hath been retarded, chiefly, we confess, by our own
    sins, and the sins of these nations, partly through the malice of
    Satan, the diuisions of brethren, the secret and subtile practices of
    Romish emissaries, fomenting errors and heresies, and not a little, as
    we humbly conceive, through the want of church gouernment, settled and
    established by the ciuil authority, whereby those unto whom the
    exercise of church power is committed by Christ may be impoured to keep
    back ignorant and prophane persons from polluting the ordinances of
    God, as alsoe by reason of some ancient lawes, alledged and urged by
    diuers as yet in force, injoyning ministers to dispense the Sacrament
    of the Lord's Supper, without affording them (as we conceiue)
    sufficient power regularly to keep back such as are not duly qualified
    for the same, by reason whereof ministers are liable to prosecution att
    law (of which we have had a late instance in this county).

    "We therefore, your petitioners, in faithfulness to the interest of God
    and his glory, Christ and his gospell, our own and other men's soules,
    and from our sincere desires of the aduancement of the kingdome of
    Christ in these nations, in the promoting whereof the interest and
    welfare of states and nations is uery much concerned, we neither could
    nor durst be longer silent, but being persuaded of your willingness to
    act for Christ, and hopeing that God hath raised you up to carry on the
    work of reformation already begun amongst us, and to be repairers of
    our breaches and restorers of pathes to dwel in, we are incouraged
    humbly to pray,

    "1. That such ancient lawes as may be yet in force relating to the
    Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, so far as they are or may prove
    burdensome to truly godly and conscientious ministers and people, may
    be duly regulated.

    "2. That so far as you in your wisdomes shall think fitt, ordinances of
    Parliament that have been made after aduice had with the late Assembly
    of Diuines in order {177} to Church settlement, may be returned upon,
    and begun reformation carried on.

    "3. That in regard a thorough settlement of Church affaires may be long
    under debate, in the mean time some speedy and effectuall course may be
    taken, where by ignorant and scandalous persons may be kept from the
    Lord's Supper.

_Lancashire Fairy Tale._--The nursery rhymes in one of your late Numbers
remind me of a story I used to be told in the nursery. It was, that two men
went poaching, and having placed nets, or rather sacks, over what they
supposed to be rabbit-holes, but which were in reality fairies' houses, the
fairies rushed into the sacks, and the poachers, content with their prey,
marched home again. A fairy missing another in the sack, called out (the
story was told in broad Lancashire dialect) "Dick (dignified name for a
fairy), where art thou?" To which fairy Dick replied,

       "In a sack,
        On a back,
  Riding up Barley Brow."

The story has a good moral ending, for the poachers were so frightened that
they never poached again.

_Teeth, Superstition respecting_ (Vol. vi., p. 601.).--A similar (perhaps
the same) piece of childish superstition respecting the teeth is, that when
the upper incisors are large, it is a sign that you will live to be rich.

_New Moon Divination._--Being lately on a visit in Yorkshire, I was amused
one evening to find the servants of the house excusing themselves for being
out of the way when the bell rang, on the plea that they had been "hailing
the first new moon of the new year." This mysterious salutation was
effected, I believe, by means of a looking-glass, in which the first sight
of the moon was to be had, and the object to be gained was the important
secret as to how many years would elapse before the marriage of the
observers. If one moon was seen in the glass, one year; if two, two years;
and so on. In the case in question, the maid and the boy saw only one moon
a-piece. Whether the superstition would, in this instance, be suggestive to
their minds of anything to be deduced from the coincidence, I do not know;
but as they were both very old-fashioned folks, I suppose the custom may
not be unknown to those learned in Folk Lore.

What is the orthodox mode of conducting this kind of divination?

_The Hyena an Ingredient in Love Potions._--In Busbequius's _Letters_
(Elzevir, 1633) I note that the Turks consider the hyena useful in love
potions. I extract the passage:

    "In amatoriis ei vim magnam Turcae, ut etiam veteres, tribuunt, cumque
    essent duae eo tempore Constantinopoli, mihi tamen vendere gravabantur,
    quod se Sultanae, hoc est, principis uxori, eas reservare dicerent,
    quippe quas philtris et magicis artibus animum mariti retinere, recepta
    in vulgus (ut dixi) opinio est."--P. 84.

Allow me to add a Query: What ancient authors allude to this old specimen
of Folk Lore?

_The Elder Tree._--I was visiting a poor parishioner the other day, when
the following question was put to me.

"Pray, Sir, can you tell me whether there is any doubt of what kind of wood
our Lord's cross was made? I have always heard that it was made of _elder_,
and we look carefully into the faggots before we burn them, for fear that
there should be any of this wood in them."

My Query is, Whether this is a common superstition?

Minor Notes.

_The Word "Party."_--Our facetious friend _Punch_ has recently made merry
with the modern use of the word "party," as applied to any absent person
concerned in any pending negotiation. It was used thus, however, by William
Salmon, professor of physic, in his _Family Dictionary_, 1705:

    "Let the party, if it can be agreeable, rub frequently his teeth with
    the ashes that remain in a pipe after it is smoaked."--P. 315.

    "Having cooled it, rub the party's mouth with a little of it," &c.--P.
    321.

_Epitaphs._--Churchyard literature presents to us some curious specimens of
metaphor; and it is interesting to observe how an old idea is sometimes
unintentionally reproduced. The following lines may be seen on a gravestone
in the churchyard at Kinver, Staffordshire:

 "Tired with wand'ring thro' a world of sin,
  Hither we came to _Nature's common Inn_,
  To rest our wearied bodys for a night,
  In hopes to rise that Christ may give us light."

{178} The writer was probably not aware that Spenser says, in his _Faerie
Queen_, iii. 3. 30.:

 "And if he then with victorie can lin,
  He shall his days with peace bring to his _earthly In_."

And again, _Faerie Queen_, ii. 1. 59.:

 "Palmer, quoth he, death is an equall doome
  To good and bad, the _common In of rest_."

A Leicestershire poet has recorded, in the churchyard of Melton Mowbray, a
very different conception of our "_earthly Inn_." He says:

 "_This world's an Inn_, and I her guest:
  I've eat and drank and took my rest
  With her awhile, and now I pay
  Her lavish bill, and go my way."

You may, perhaps, consider this hardly worthy of a place in your paper; but
I act upon the principle which you inculcate in your motto.

_Campbell's "Pleasures of Hope."_--It has often occurred to me that in two
lines of the most celebrated passage in this poem,--

 "O'er Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,
  Her blood-red waters murmuring far below,"

the author has confounded Prague, the capital of Bohemia, with Praga, the
suburb of Warsaw. The bridge over the Moldau, at the former place, is a
stone one of European celebrity; and to it Campbell must have referred when
using terms not at all applicable to that over the Vistula, which is of
much humbler form and material.

In Campbell's "Ode to the Highland Society on 21st March," he describes the
42nd Regiment as having been at Vimiera, which it assuredly was not; and no
Highland regiment was in the battle except the 71st. I suspect he
confounded the "Black Watch" with the distinguished corps next to it on the
army list,--an error into which the author of _Charles O'Malley_ also must
have fallen, as he makes Highlanders form a part of the Light Division,
which consisted of the 43rd, 52nd, and 95th.

_Palindromical Lines._--In addition to the verses given by your
correspondent H. H. BREEN (Vol. vi., p. 449.), I send you the following, as
perhaps the most remarkable of its kind in existence. It is mentioned by
Jeremy Taylor as the inscription somewhere on a font. Letter by letter it
reads the same, whether taken backward or forwards:

"Wash my guilt, and not my face only."

_"Derrick" and "Ship's Painter."_--The following Note may perhaps interest
some of your readers:--The ancient British word _derrick_, or some such
word, still exists in our marine. It is used in sea phrase to define a
crane for temporary purposes, and is not unusually represented by a single
spar, which is stepped near a hatchway, provided with a tackle or purchase,
in order to the removal of goods from the hold of a vessel. The use of
_Derry_, both as a termination in the names of places, and in the old
ballad chorus of _Down derry down_, is familiar to every one.

Some other of our sea terms might receive apt illustration in "N. & Q.;"
and I should beg to suggest "unde derivatur" a boat's _painter_,--the name
of the rope which confines a ship's boat to the vessel, when at sea.

Turner gave a world-wide interest to the phrase when he called, in his
eccentric manner, one of his finest marine pictures "Now for the painter."

_Lord Reay's Country._--Formerly the parish of Durness comprehended the
whole of the district known as "Lord Reay's country," or, as it is called
in Gaelic, "Duthaic Mhic Aoi," _i. e._ the land of the Mackays, extending
from the river of Borgie, near Strathnaver, to the Kyle of Assynt, and
comprehending a space of about 800 square miles! Since 1734 it has been
divided into three parishes, viz. Eddrachillis, Durness, and Tongue, with
the parish of Farr: it was disjoined from the presbytery of Caithness, and
by an act of the Assembly attached to the presbytery of Tongue.

Queries.

UNANSWERED QUERIES.

I think it may be permitted to Querists, who may fail in obtaining answers,
to recur to their questions after the lapse of a reasonable time, in order
to awaken attention. I asked a question at page 270., Vol. vi., in which I
was, and still am, much interested. Perhaps MR. COLLIER will do me the
favour to answer it, particularly as his annotated folio is remarkably rich
in "_stage directions_."

Before taking the liberty of putting the question so directly to MR.
COLLIER, I awaited an examination of his recently-published volume of
selected corrections, in which, however, the point upon which I seek
information is not alluded to.

In glancing over that volume, I perceive that MR. COLLIER, in his notes at
the end (p. 508.), does "N. & Q." the honour to refer to it, by alluding to
an emendation "proposed by MR. CORNISH" ("N. & Q.," Vol. vi., p. 312.).

When that emendation appeared I recognised it at once as having been
proposed by Warburton and applauded by Dr. Johnson. I did not, however,
then think it of sufficient importance to trouble the editor of "N. & Q.,"
by correcting a claim which, although apparent, might not perhaps be
intentional. {179}

But now, since the ownership (_quantum valeat_) has deceived even MR.
COLLIER, and is endorsed by him, it is time to notice it.

P.S.--I may add that, with respect to these words "happy low lie down,"
from my habit of looking for solutions of difficulties in parallels and
antitheses, I have arrived at a different conclusion from any that has yet
been suggested. Finding "uneasy" used _adverbially_ in the last line, I see
no reason why "happy" should not also be taken _adverbially_ in the
preceding line: we should then have the same verb, "lie" and "lies,"
repeated antithetically in the same mood and tense.

The article _the_ before "low" has probably been omitted in the press, and
may be either actually restored or elliptically understood:

 "Then _happy_ [the] low lie down;
  _Uneasy_ lies the head that wears a crown."

MR. JOHN MUNRO.

Between the years 1803 and 1830, a gentleman resident of London, under the
signature A. Z., presented from time to time to the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland, a collection of works respecting the Orkney and Shetland
islands, copiously illustrated with manuscript notes and inserted prints,
maps, &c. The internal evidence leaves no room to doubt that the donor of
this valuable collection was a native of Kirkwall; and recent
investigations lead to the conclusion that he was a Mr. John Munro,
originally in the office of Mr. John Heddle, Town Clerk of Kirkwall. He
appears to have gone to London about 1789, and to have passed the rest of
his life there, down to May, 1830, when his last communication was made to
the Scottish Antiquaries. A list of his donations is printed in the
_Archaeologia Scotica_, vol. iii. pp. 267-274. His copious manuscript
notes, written in a very neat and legible hand, indicate not only a man of
intelligence and research, but also of an exceedingly amiable and kindly
disposition, and strongly influenced by the _amor patriae_, which gave to
his donations their exclusive character.

I am anxious to ascertain what was Mr. Munro's occupation in London, the
date of his death, and any interesting or characteristic notes concerning
him. Judging from his tastes, it seems highly probable that he may have
been known to more than one of your metropolitan correspondents.

Perhaps you will not think such Queries undeserving of a corner in your
useful vehicle of literary intercommunication, nor A. Z.'s _anonimity_
unworthy of an effort to rede the riddle.

_R. S. Townshend of Manchester._--I know that you have several intelligent
correspondents in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and it is probable that
they may be able to give me some information respecting a Mr. R. S.
Townshend, a person of literary taste and pursuits, who resided in that
town about the year 1730. His Common-place Book, or Diary, which has fallen
into my hands, contains numerous allusions to the leading gentry and clergy
of the neighbourhood; and more than once it mentions the well-known Dr.
Byrom, under the title of "Il Gran Maestro de Tachigraphia." Dr. Deacon, a
distinguished person among the Nonjurors, is also mentioned. The acting of
Cato by the scholars of the grammar-school on Dec. 20, 1732, is also
mentioned, with some critiques upon the performers. The elections at the
collegiate church are constantly referred to as subjects of all-absorbing
interest; there being a strong party, {180} as well in the town as in the
church, of Jacobites, and these elections being regarded as a trial of
party strength.

_Fabulous Bird._--Among the many quaint and beautiful conceits in Fuller,

to the water to drink, and finding there, by reflection, that he had killed

itself."

Was it ever the fashion to pronounce these different terminations alike; or
does any other author of repute of that date use such rhymes?

Again, "hour" and "traveller" are made to rhyme in _Astraea Redux_, 147,

_The Cadenham Oak._--Can any of the correspondents of "N. & Q." inform me
if this famous old tree is still alive? It flourished for nearly three
centuries in Hampshire Forest; and during this long period was visited by
crowds of people, who, it must be confessed, entertained towards it a
religious veneration--from its peculiarity of annually shooting forth its
buds on old Christmas-day. If dead, as I suppose--for the account which I
read some years ago stated that it was fast decaying--then I would like to
know if the young tree, one of its progeny, is still flourishing in the
forest, and enjoying, from its peculiarity, the same veneration {181} which
was paid to the parent stock. Those of your readers who wish to know more
of this venerable oak, and of the trees which sprung from it, are referred
to Mr. Gilpin's able and interesting work on forest scenery, published, as
I believe, in London between sixty and seventy years ago.

    and his displeasure at what he considered neglect, he vented in such

_Derivation of "Lowbell."_--I see MR. STERNBERG, in his "Dialect and
Folk-lore of Northamptonshire," gives a new explanation of the puzzling
word _lowbell_, in Beaumont and Fletcher's _Woman's Prize_, Act I. Sc. 3.
It appears that Northamptonshire peasants have a way of their own for
punishing offenders against good morals:

    "On the first appearance of the culprit in 'strit,' or on 'grin,' the
    villagers rise _en masse_, and greet him with a terrible din of tin
    pots and kettles, &c.; and, amidst the hooting and vociferation of the
    multitude, he is generally compelled to seek shelter by flight. This is
    called 'lowbelling,' and the actors are termed 'lowbells,' or
    'lowbellers,' forming a tolerable explanation of the _lowbell_ in
    Beaumont and Fletcher's _Woman's Prize_, Act I. Sc. 3., which has so
    long mystified the commentators:

     '_Petru._ If you can carry't so, 'tis very well.
      _Bian._ No, you shall carry it, Sir.
      _Petru._ Peace, gentle _Lowbell_.'"

MR. STERNBERG derives it from the Anglo-Saxon _lowian_, past participle of
the Anglo-Saxon _lowian_, and the verb _bellan_. This would seem
satisfactory; but I should like to know whether the word is current
anywhere else besides Northamptonshire.

_Meaning of Assassin._--Can any reader of the "N. & Q." inform me of the
correct meaning of the word "assassin?" The old story of the nation of the
assassins, under their prince the "Old Man of the Mountain," I reject as
absurd, although Gibbon adopts it. I have my own idea, which agrees with
Mr. Lane in his account of the modern Egyptians, who derives it from the
Arabic word "_Hushhusheen_, one drunk with hemp." M. Volney says it comes
from the Arabic "_Hass_, to kill, or lie in ambush to kill." Which of all
these derivations is correct?

    "The latest case of punishment under the act is supposed to have
    occurred in 1759, when Neil McFie was banished by the circuit court of
    Inverness, for being 'held and reputed a Popish priest.' Later
    instances might be adduced of punishment for exercising the Roman

I have heard that after its publication sundry persons, judging perhaps
from the eccentricity of many of the costumes, doubted their accuracy, and
even considered them the result of M. Herbe's fancy; and that that
gentleman, annoyed at the imputation, subsequently published another work
citing his authorities.

THE ORKNEY ISLANDS IN PAWN.

(Vol. vii., p. 105.)

It gives me much pleasure to be enabled to inform your correspondent
KIRKWALLENSIS that there is no fear of our losing these islands in the
manner suggested by him, they having been renounced by Denmark nearly four
hundred years ago, as will be seen from the following sketch.

The Orkneys were taken from the Picts about A.D. 838, by Kenneth II., king
of Scotland, to which kingdom they were attached until 1099, when Donald
VIII., surnamed Bane, brother to Malcolm Canmore, usurped the crown, to the
prejudice of his nephews Edgar, Alexander, and David; and requiring
assistance to maintain his position, he applied to Magnus, king of Norway,
to whom, says Skene, "for help and supply he gave all the isles of Scotland
(Camden says the Orkneys only), where, through and for other causes, many
bloody battles were fought, until the battle of Larges, 3rd August, 1260,
in the time of Alexander III. of Scotland, and Acho, king of Norway." The
Scots proving victorious, Magnus of Norway, son and successor of Acho, made
peace with Alexander, and renounced and discharged all right and title
which he or his successors had, or might have or pretend, to the isles of
Scotland, the king of Scotland paying therefor yearly to the said Magnus
and his successors one hundred marks of sterling money. This contract was
confirmed in 1312 by Haquin V. of Norway and Robert I. of Scotland. In 1426
Eric X. of Denmark renewed with James I. of Scotland these ancient
treaties, particularly with regard to the Western Isles; the pension or
annuity having been long omitted to be paid, Eric now freely gave it up to
James; and thus, in appearance, the Orkneys were finally confirmed to
Scotland; but virtually it was not so until 1468, when, says Skene, "at
last the said annual, with all the arrearages and by-runs thereof, was
discharged and renounced _simpliciter_, in the contract of marriage between
King James III. and Margaret, daughter of Christian I., king of Norway,
Denmark, and Sweden, on the 8th of September, 1468; which discharge is not
only ratified, but renewed thereafter by the said king, on the 12th May,
1469. It appears that James III., on the 24th February, 1483, commanded his
ambassador sent to the Pope to desire a confirmation of the said perpetual
renunciation and discharge of the contribution of the Isles."

According to Dr. Wallace's account (1700), King Christian agreed that the
isles of Orkney and Zetland should remain in the possession of King James
and his successors, as the Princess Margaret's dower, until either King
Christian or his successors should pay to King James or his successors the
sum of fifty thousand florins of the Rhine; but in the year following,
hearing of his daughter's delivery of a prince at Edinburgh, he "for joy
thereof renounced for ever to the crown of Scotland all right or claim to
the said isles."

KIRKWALLENSIS seems to have been led into an error respecting the Orkneys.
It is true that Orkney and Shetland belonged to the crown of Norway, to
which the Scottish family of St. Clair, or Sinclair, rendered military
service for the earldom. It was not, however, to an English king, but to
James III. of Scotland that Christian gave the hand of "the Maid of
Norway." In the marriage preliminaries the latter thus stipulates
respecting the dower:--"Rex cedit sexaginta aureorum Rhenensium
[florenorum] millia, ejus summae priusquam e Danae regno sponsa digrediatur
numeraturus aureorum decem millia, quod vero reliquum esset supplerent
insulae regni Norvegici, jam memoratae, _Orcades_, una cum jurisdictione ac
caeteris eodem pertinentibus, hac tamen lege, ut insulas eas, eousque
teneat Scotiae Rex sub firma _hypotheca_ donec vel ipse, vel ejus heredes,
Daniae ac Norvegiae Reges, aequa vicissim portione easdem redimant." This
article was afterwards embodied in the marriage contract:--"Et terrae
insularum Orchaden Regi nostro Jacobo _impignoratae, ad Norvegiae reges
revertentur_," &c. Both documents are preserved in Torfaeus (_Orcades_, pp.
188--191.). Mr. Auker's discovery of the original is, however, an
interesting circumstance, as it would seem that the marriage in question
was but the result of an attempt to settle amicably an ancient dispute
respecting the sovereignty of the Hebrides--"vetus controversia de Haebudis
et Mannia magnis utriusque populi cladibus agitata"--which the king of
France, as umpire, had been unable to pronounce upon, in consequence of the
loss or concealment of the original instruments.

THE PASSAGE IN KING HENRY VIII., ACT III. SC. 2.

(Vol. vii., pp. 5. 111.)

Having no desire to enter into unnecessary controversy, I do not often
reply to objections made to my conjectural emendations of passages in
Shakspeare; but on the present occasion I think it incumbent on me to
appeal to the common sense of those who take interest in such matters, by
merely placing in juxta-position the reading I have proposed, and that of
your Leeds correspondent, and thus leave it to their impartial decision
without fear of the result. It may be necessary, as your correspondent has
adverted to {184} what precedes, to give the passage as it stands in the
folio at some length. Wolsey having said--

                 "For your great Graces
  Heap'd upon me (poore Undeserver) I
  Can nothing offer but my Allegiant thankes,
  My Prayres to heaven for you; my Loyaltie
  Which ever ha's, and ever shall be growing
  Till death (that Winter) kill it."

The King replies:

 "Fairely answer'd:
  A Loyal, and obedient Subject is
  Therein illustrated, the Honor of it
  Does pay the Act of it, as i'th' contrary
  The fowlenesse is the punishment. I presume
  That as my hand ha's open'd Bounty to you,
  My heart dropt Love, my powre rain'd Honor, more
  On you, then any: So your Hand, and Heart,
  Your Braine, and every Function of your power,
  Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
  As 'twer in Love's particular, be more
  To me your Friend, then any."

Wolsey rejoins:

                         "I do professe
  That for your Highnesse good, I ever labour'd
  More then mine owne: that am, haue, and will be
  (Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
  And throw it from their Soule, though perils did
  Abound, as thicke as thought could make 'em, and
  Appeare in formes more horrid) yet my Duty,
  As doth a Rocke against the chiding Flood,
  Should the approach of this wilde River breake,
  And stand unshaken yours."

I read:

                         "I do profess
  That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
  More than mine own: that _I'm true_, and will be,
  Though all the world should lack their duty to you,
  And throw it from their soul: though perils did
  Abound, as thick as thought could make them, and
  Appear in forms more horrid; yet my duty
  (As doth a rock against the chiding flood)
  Should the approach of this wild river break,
  And stand unshaken yours."

Your Leeds correspondent would read:

                         "I do profess
  That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
  More than mine own.--_That_, am _I_, have, and will be,
  Though all the world should crack their duty to you
  And throw it from their soul," &c.

For his arguments I must refer to his note (p. 111. _ante_), merely
observing that I cannot conceive how any alteration in the punctuation of
the King's speech could connect it with this! Making _That_ emphatic helps
nothing, as there is no antecedent to which it can refer; and if "we can by
no means part with _have_," we must interpolate _been_ after it to make it
any way intelligible, to the marring of the verse.

With regard to the substitution of _lack_ for _crack_ in my former note, it
should be recollected that I then said "I do not insist upon this." We
might, however, substitute _slack_, if change should be deemed necessary,
and it would be still nearer in form to the suspected word.

I may safely leave the _palpable_ error in _As You Like It_ to the decision
of common sense.

As I am dealing with corrections in the play of _King Henry VIII._, I may
take occasion to observe that MR. COLLIER, in his recent supplemental
volume of _Notes and Emendations_, has, I have no doubt unwittingly, stated
that a passage, Act IV. Sc. 2., has been absurdly pointed, "over and over
again, from the year 1623 to our own day." Whereas it will be found
corrected, exactly as it stands in his second folio, in the edition I gave
of Shakspeare in 1826, with a note adverting to the absurdity of the old
pointing. I may further add, that the first instance MR. COLLIER gives in
his preface of the corrections in his folio, is in the same predicament. He
has stated that the reading of "Aristotle's _cheeks_" for "Aristotle's
_ethics_," in the first scene of the _Taming of the Shrew_, "has been the
invariable text from the first publication in 1623 until our own day;" when
the fact is, that it stands properly corrected in my edition in 1826, with
the following note:

    "Blackstone suggests that we should read _ethics_, and the sense seems
    to require it; I have therefore admitted it into the text."

It is possible that MR. COLLIER may have never looked into my edition of
the poet, and I may honestly say that I regret it, not on my own account
but on his, for I think, had he consulted it, his own would not have been
the worse for it.

MINIATURE RING OF CHARLES I.

(Vol. vi., p. 578.)

By the courtesy of W. K. Rogers, Esq. (in whose possession it is), I am
enabled to account for another of these interesting and invaluable relics;
one of the four said to have been presented by the Martyr prior to his
execution.

    "ROGERS OF LOTA.

    This family was early remarkable for its loyalty and attachment to the
    Crown; a ring is still preserved as an heir-loom, which was presented
    to its ancestor by King Charles I. during his misfortunes."--Burke's
    _Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland_.

Robert Rogers of Lota received extensive grants of land from Charles II.,
which upon the accession of James II. were confirmed to him by letters
patent. He was Mayor of Cork, 1680, M. P. for that city 1692, and again
1695. In the body of his will, bearing date 1690, and registered in the
Record Court, Dublin, occurs the following {185} paragraph, embraced by
brackets, as if he wished to convey forcibly his appreciation of the value
of the relic:

    ["And I also bequeath to Noblett Rogers the miniature portrait-ring of
    the martyr Charles I., given by that monarch to my ancestor previous to
    his execution; and I particularly desire that it may be preserved in
    the name and family."]

The miniature, which is beautifully painted in enamel, and said to be by
Vandyke, has been reset in a tasteful and appropriate style; and it is in
this state that I have seen it. But Mr. Rogers informs me that its original
setting and inscriptions exactly corresponded with those of the ring in the
possession of the Misses Pigott, described in Hulbert's _History of Salop_;
and the same tradition exists in the family as to its having been _one of
four_ presented by Charles to certain of his friends or followers. There
can be little question, therefore, as to the genuineness of both these
rings. With regard to the portrait being the work of Vandyke, Mr. R. writes
to me--

    "I know not on what authority it is stated, but I believe there is not
    a family of old standing in the county Cork in which tradition has not
    assigned its execution to that master; and certainly in Rome, where it
    was much admired, the artists, when questioned 'Whose style?'
    frequently answered, 'Vandyke.'"

Portraits by Vandyke in enamel, it is said, are known to be in existence.
Whether so renowned a master would have submitted to the wearisome and
laborious operation of repeating a number of works so minute, even for a
crowned head, seems to admit of a doubt; yet there is no difficulty in
imagining him to have superintended the progress of the artist employed to
copy his own portrait of Charles, and even to have bestowed some finishing
touches upon it.

I have lately seen a ring with a portrait of Charles on ivory, in coarse
and very inferior style, and in a plain gold setting. It is in the
possession of a gentleman in whose family it has continued for several
generations. Doubtless many such memorials of their murdered king were worn
at the time by his devoted partizans, and may yet be in existence.

CHANTRY CHAPELS.

(Vol. vi., p. 223.)

At the Derby Congress of the British Archaeological Association, the Duke
of Rutland exhibited a document of which the following notice by Mr. H. N.
Black is made in the Journal of their _Transactions_ (vol. for 1851, p.
297.):

    "A bull of Pope Alexander IV., dated at Viterbo, 2 id. Mar., anno 4,
    viz., 14 March, 1258. It is addressed to the Bishop of Coventry,
    setting forth that Richard de Herthull lived in a place remote from the
    mother church, which at some seasons was inaccessible; that he already
    had a chapel on his own land, and desired to have a chaplain to serve
    therein, for whom he was prepared to provide fit support. The matter
    was therefore referred to his diocesan, to grant license accordingly if
    he should deem it expedient. The leaden seal is yet attached to this
    beautiful little document."

Then follow the words of the document in Latin.

Herthull has been corrupted into _Hartle_: and on the moor of this name a
chapel still remains, although of much later date than that mentioned in
the above-named document; traces of an earlier erection are however still
visible in a portion of the present foundations. It is now used as a barn.
Distant from this about two miles, at Meadow Place, near Yolgrave, is
another chapel, now used for a similar purpose as the foregoing. In this,
the jambs of all the windows still remain; the east window is a very large
one.

The above is not intended to answer W. H. K.'s Query, but rather as a note
in connexion with it.

Chester.

In the North Riding of Yorkshire, celebrated for its monasteries, &c., were
many chantry chapels, both in the hamlets, and in the rural situations
apart from them. Gill's _Vallis Eboracensis_ contains an account of
several; among the rest may be noticed one at Newton Grange. This chapel,
which is now used for agricultural purposes, is preserved, by request of
its noble owner Lord Feversham, in its primitive form. It stands in a
meadow field, at some distance from the ruins of the ancient seat of the
Cholmeleys, and was used as a burial chantry, but not exclusively so. In
1820 a vault was discovered beneath the floor; and five coffins were
removed to Oswald Kirk churchyard, and re-interred there. In order to
preserve the chapel from ruin, Lady Cholmeley bequeathed one pound per
annum to the Rector of Ampleforth for preaching a sermon annually therein;
but the ruinous state of the building at that time caused the removal of
the pulpit, and the sermon is preached in the church at Oswald Kirk.

The _Valor Ecclesiasticus_ contains the records of dissolved chantries.

PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.

_The Collodion Process._--I have been much pleased with the directions
given by DR. DIAMOND in your columns for the production of collodion
positives; but they have been hitherto unaccompanied by any reference to
the causes of those numerous failures that occur in this delicate process,
and which are so disheartening to {186} beginners. I will just enumerate a
few of the appearances with which I have been troubled, and trust that they
may elicit from other operators an account of some of their instructive
failures. I will premise, as an answer to a former Query respecting the
cost and description of lenses, that I obtained mine of Mr. Goddard, now of
Jesse Cottage, Witton, Middlesex. They are combination-lenses, two inches
and a quarter in diameter (achromatic); the front lens can be used singly
for views, producing a picture nearly seven inches square, but when
combined covering four inches. For these, with brass mounting, I paid less
than 3l.: a single lens, the same diameter, would be about 1l. They work to
focus, cover flat, and define well, producing pictures equal to the most
expensive.

I have usually preferred Mr. Archer's collodion, as the most certain and
cleanest. The silver bath is composed of thirty grains nitrate of silver
and two drops of nitric acid to each ounce of distilled water. An even film
may be obtained by the following means:--Represent the plate of glass by
the following figure:

  +--------------------+
  | 1                3 |
  |                    |
  |                    |
  | 2                4 |
  +--------------------+

Hold the plate with the left hand at 1, pour a body of collodion in the
centre: tilt towards 1 (being careful not to let it touch the thumb),
incline towards 2, run into 3, and pour off at 4: then hold the plate
vertically (resting the corner 4 on the neck of the collodion bottle) to
drain: incline it first to the right and then to the left, repeating this
several times until the ridges are removed. By these means an even film may
be produced, without a thick ridge, from 2 to 4. The time it may be left
before plunging into the silver bath will depend on the temperature (about
half a minute). Dip evenly into the bath, lifting up and down to allow of
the evaporation of the ether: the film will also saturate more rapidly.
When the greasy appearance is gone, it is ready for the camera. Sometimes
the film is nearly transparent and bluish, not having sufficient iodide of
silver; or it may contain too much iodide, the greater part flaking off in
the bath, leaving the collodion with very little, and that patchy; or from
being placed in the bath too quick, the lower corner still present a
reticulated appearance, which of course renders it useless.

Having exposed the plate the necessary time, the next step is the
development. The solution I usually employ is prepared with protosulphate
of iron. I do not find distilled water absolutely necessary (during the
summer months I fancied the tones were improved by using ordinary water,
perhaps from containing a little lime), and the acetate acid is not
glacial, but a description termed Beaufoy's, much less expensive. The
proportions are--

  Water                     2 ounces.
  Acetic acid               1 drachm.
  Protosulphate of iron     8 grains.
  Nitric acid               2 drops.

Mix the water and acetic acid first; then dissolve the iron; and, lastly,
add the nitric acid, which, by varying the quantity, produces different
effects. On pouring the solution over the plate, there is sometimes a
difficulty experienced in causing it to flow evenly. Sometimes a little
more acetic acid in the developing solution, or, if the plate has been out
of the bath some time, redipping it, will prevent this; but if this does
not remove it, and the resulting picture is hard and unpleasant in tone, a
new bath is necessary. For positives, the resulting picture is more
pleasing and delicate by using the developing agent rather weak. After it
has remained on sufficiently long to bring out the image, the undecomposed
iodide is to be removed by hyposulphite of soda. I always use the same
solution, pouring it on and off until exhausted. Having sufficiently
washed, the picture may perhaps appear with many black spots, this may in
future be obviated by adding a little alcohol to the collodion:--or it may
be covered with white spots; in that case the collodion requires settling,
or rapidly filtrating through an old piece of loose silk. Sometimes it will
look all black and white (a common fault with collodion positives), without
middle tints: by adding a little more acetic acid, or an extra drop of
nitric acid, to the developing solution, or the addition of a few drops of
ordinary pyrogallic solution, this disagreeable effect may be overcome. In
taking portraits, it is often caused by having the sitter placed with too
much front light. Then, again, the should-be whites of the picture may be
dull and greenish by reflected, and red by transmitted, light. This effect
I generally find remedied by putting less nitric acid in the developing
solution. During the development, by watching the colour (by holding a
piece of white paper underneath), this red tendency may be observed; in
that case the drawing may be preserved by leaving the plate for about a
minute after pouring the developing agent off, and before removing the
iodide. Some change appears to take place by its contact with the air; it
gradually gets more opaque, and when finished, though not so white as many,
yet presenting an extremely rich brownish-yellow tone.

During the late dull weather, many of my plates have shown a tendency to an
uniform leaden-looking deposit, destroying the blacks of the picture. A
little more nitric acid in the bath will sometimes overcome this, but I
have not yet found a sufficient remedy. During the summer months I was in
the habit of using double the quantity of {187} iron I have stated,
diluting the solution more; then was compelled to diminish the quantity to
twelve grains, and now I use eight. I have tried the proportions
recommended by French photographers, but they seem to contain too large a
proportion of iron. I prefer the use of the protosulphate to the
protonitrate of iron from its cheapness, and the ease with which it is made
up. It will also keep for any length of time, rather improving than
otherwise.

I back with liquid jet from Suggitt, opposite the House of Correction,
Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell. It dries rapidly, and brightens the
appearance.

G. H. P.

_Mr. Weld Taylor's Iodizing Process._--The process I sent to your columns
last month, for iodizing paper, is applicable _only_ to the paper of Canson
Freres; and I may further explain, that if the solution does not answer
well, it may be washed over again with a solution of iodide of potassa only
of the usual strength, and then set on a dish of slightly-acidulated water,
to assist the separation and set free the potash. To make the matter clear
to MR. SHADBOLT, I may observe, to one who is in the habit of iodizing
paper, a considerable amount of the passage relating to cyanide of potassa
could not be misunderstood; the nitrate of silver being added to the iodide
of potassa, forms at once a precipitate which it is required to take up.
The old double iodide says, add iodide of potassa till it does so, and it
will do so; but the cyanide of potassa does it much better, and the
cyanogen is lost as the paper dries, otherwise it would take no image at
all. In the process I gave it merely requires an equivalent, "and cyanide
of potassa is always of use in many of these processes." That equivalent is
of course best arrived at by a solution, as, if the cyanide of potassa were
added in the lump, it would be lost or be in excess.

Further, I may enlighten MR. SHADBOLT by assuring him that the iodizing
paper with the ammonio-nitrate of silver, which I never saw published yet,
is the best way; and I may confidently assert that the better ways of
iodizing papers are not published at all. It is a tedious process to do,
but it is as certain as taking a positive from a negative. At present I
have not space to give my way of doing it. I may also add, that it will not
answer with all papers. In fact, all samples of paper require some
modification of the process, as the chemicals are different in the various
modes of bleaching paper by different manufacturers. The ammonio-nitrate is
perfect with Whatman's paper; indeed it is a subject of much regret, that
this maker has not turned out a paper as thin and hard as the Canson
Freres. The latter gentlemen have added some chemical, probably iodine, to
their paper, which renders it almost impossible to iodize it at all. I
believe it to be iodine, because the paper becomes perfectly black over
_free_ iodine, which no English paper will do. At all events, this paper is
very uncertain, although it has a quality in appearance that is unsurpassed
by any other.

_Sir William Newton's Process: Further Explanations._--In reply to your
correspondent F. MAXWELL LYTE, who is desirous of knowing my motive for
washing the paper over with chloride of barium previous to iodizing--

In the first place, I find that it appears to give strength to the paper.

Secondly, that the action in the camera is better and more certain.

Thirdly, it keeps cleaner in the bringing-out process, thereby allowing a
longer time for a more complete development.

Fourthly, I have never found any _solarizing_ take place since I have used
it (about three years); and, fifthly, I find that it keeps longer and
better after it is excited for the camera.

From the observations which I have made since I have made use of chloride
of barium, I conclude that it has the effect of _destroying_ any injurious
properties which may be in the paper, and more especially with respect to
the SIZE; and besides which, when combined with iodide of silver, greater
intensity is obtained in the negative.

I have occasionally prepared paper without chloride of barium, but I have
always found (except for positives) that I could not rely upon it with the
same degree of certainty. I need scarcely add that throughout the whole of
this process the greatest care and attention is required, and that the
water should be constantly agitated while the paper is in it, and that the
water should be once changed.

_Lady Nevell's Music-book_ (Vol. vii., p. 59.).--To transpose the six-line
staves of old music into the five-line staves of modern notation, it is
only necessary to treat the lowest line of the treble, and the highest line
of the bass, as ledger lines. The five remaining will correspond with the
five now in use.

_Tuch_ (Vol. vii., p. 82.).--ALPHAGE suggests that the "touchstone" had its
name because "a musical sound may be produced by touching it {188} sharply
with a stick." I think this is an error, and that it owes its name to its
use in the assay of gold and silver. We find this application of it
described in a work (now scarce) published in 1677, under the title of _A
Touchstone for Gold and Silver Wares_. The author, after describing the
qualities of a good touchstone, observes (p. 36.):

    "The way to make a true touch on the touch-stone is thus: When your
    touch-stone is very clean ... your silver being filed ... rub it
    steadily, and very hard, on the stone ... until the place of the stone
    whereon you rub be like the metal itself ... wet all the toucht places
    with your tongue, and it will show itself in its own countenance."

And that the touchstone was used in this connexion at a much earlier period
is obvious from the language of the ancient statutes. The 28 Edward I.,
stat. 3. cap. 20., requires all gold and silver wares to be "of good and
true allay, that is to say, gold of a certain _touch_." And the word occurs
in the same sense in other statutes.

The error of Coleridge, alluded to by your correspondent ALPHAGE, is
certainly not a little singular, especially as the word, in the sense of
stone or marble, occurs in Ben Jonson, Drayton, and Sir John Harrington,
and there is a good article on the word in Nares's _Glossary_. I must,
however, altogether dissent from your correspondent's statement that the
reason for the name of Touchstone is, that a musical sound may be produced
by touching it sharply with a stick, and agree with Nares that it obtained
its name from being used as a test for gold. See a very interesting article
on Assay Marks by Mr. Octavius Morgan (_Archaeological Journal_, ix. 127.),
from which it appears that, for the trial of gold, touch-needles were
applied to the touchstone.

_Eva, Princess of Leinster_ (Vol. vi., p. 388.).--O'Haloran, in his
_History of Ireland_, says:

    In 1168, Dermot Mac Murchad, King of Leinster, having carried away
    Dearbhorgie, wife of O'Ruark, prince of Breffin, was driven from his
    kingdom by the husband, assisted by the lady's father, the King of
    Meath.

    "He arrived at Bristol, having obtained letters patent of Henry II. for
    any of the king's subjects to assist him against his enemies: but no
    one in Bristol was found able or willing to undertake such expedition,
    when Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke, who resided at Chepstow Castle,
    offered his assistance (Seyer's _Memoirs of Bristol_); and, in 1169,
    entered Ireland with two hundred knights and others, to the number of
    1000. The object being effected, Strongbow was united to Eva, the
    daughter of Dermot; and, at that prince's death, became seised of
    Leinster."

By this it appears, that Dermot eloped with the lady in 1168; and, as
Strongbow was united to Eva the following year, Eva consequently could not
have been the offspring of that connexion. Who her mother was, I am unable
to find out.

suit the various sizes of offenders.

_The Dodo_ (Vol. vii., p. 32.).--The progress of the interesting inquiry in
"N. & Q." regarding the Dodo, induces me to communicate the fact, that
amongst the architectural decorations of the palace of the ancient Kings of
Kandy, in Ceylon (now inhabited by the governor, Reginald C. Buller, Esq.),
there occur frequent and numerous representations of a bird, which in every
particular of shape is identical with the extinct fowl of Mauritius. What
is more curious is, that the natives were familiar with the figure as that
of "the sacred bird," which is common on the Buddhist monuments throughout
the island; but Ceylon possesses no existing species at all resembling the
Dodo. I have a drawing copied from the figures in the Kandy palace; but as
your publication does not admit of engraved illustration, I do not send it.

J. EMERSON TENNENT.

Some weeks ago, on looking over a box of old Kentish deeds and papers, P.
C. S. S. found a lease, signed by his ancestor Sir John Fineux, on the 6th
of October, 1522, to which is affixed a seal in perfect preservation,
bearing what P. C. S. S. has hitherto erroneously supposed to be the crest
of the Fineux family, viz. an eagle displayed. He is now, however, indebted
to your correspondent (Vol. vi., p. 83.) for the conviction that it must be
a Dodo, and that it can represent nothing else. For it is of "unwieldy
form," has "disproportionate wings," and is altogether of a "clumsy
figure." P. C. S. S. has till now believed that the uncouth appearance of
the bird was owing to the want of skill in the artist. But it is now clear
that it must undoubtedly be a Dodo; and P. C. S. S. will henceforward live,
_sibi carior_, in the certainty that the chief justice of England temp.
Henry VIII., from whom he has the honour to descend, bore a "veritable
Dodo" as his crest.

P. C. S. S. takes this occasion of adverting to some Queries which appeared
a few months ago, respecting serjeants' rings. He has in his {189}
possession one of those given by Sir John Fineux on his assumption of the
coif. The motto is, "Suae quisque fortunae faber."

whom QUAERO refers, as having sat in the second parliament of Charles II.,
must have been Sir John Covert, Baronet, who was member for Horsham. The
misnomer would not be surprising in a list which contains such names as
Nosrooth for Noseworthy, Cowshop for Courthope, Meestry for Masters, and
Grubbaminton and Zerve for Heaven knows what!

_Llandudno on the Great Orme's Head_ (Vol. v., pp. 175. 235. 305.).--I am
surprised that the twice-repeated Query of your correspondent L. G. T. of
Lichfield yet remains unanswered. "The cavern" he refers to is that called
Llech, and concerning which he has fallen into several errors. The cavern,
so far from having been lately discovered, has been known for generations
past, and is yearly visited by hundreds of strangers. If the entrance has
been made as private and inaccessible as possible, there is nobody to blame
but nature and time; for the ancient approach was from the summit of the
cliff by means of a flight of stone and grass steps, of which traces still
remain connected with an old stone wall. The cave is easily descried from
the sea-shore below, whence it can be reached by the aid of a common
ladder. The shape is not heptagonal, as stated by L. G. T.; but is
semi-octagonal, terminated in front by two square columns of freestone. The
front and seats are in perfect preservation; but of the stone table, which
many years ago occupied the centre, the pedestal only remains. The font, or
rather stone basin, is supplied by a spring of most delicious water, which,
at certain seasons, flows in copious quantities into an artificial bath
excavated in the rock below. It is said that the cave was fitted up as a
grotto, or pleasure-house, by some ancestors of the Mostyn family; and this
is all that is known about it. I have measured the principal dimensions,
and find the quantities given by L. G. T. sufficiently accurate.

churches of the diocese, were: Sable, a chevron or, between three owls
proper; on a chief of the second as many roses gules.

_The Cross and the Crucifix_ (Vol. v., pp. 39. 85.).--Under this title I
find two articles; and, as it is an interesting subject, I should like to
send a quotation which I copied some time since from the _Octavius_ of
Minucius Felix, A.D. 210 (Adam. Clarke):

    "Cruces etiam nec colimus nec optamus. Vos plane qui ligneos deos
    consecratis, cruces ligneas, ut deorum vestrorum partes, forsitan
    adoratis. Nam et signa ipsa, et cantabra, et vexilla castrorum, quid
    aliud quam inauratae cruces sunt et ornatae? Tropaea vestra victricia
    non tantum simplicis crucis faciem, verum et affixi hominis imitantur.
    Signum sane crucis naturaliter visimus in {190} navi, cum velis
    tumentibus vehitur, cum expansis palmulis labitur," &c.

Similar sentiments, in almost the same words, are expressed by Tertullian,
_Apologet._, sect. 16.; and _Ad Nationes_, sect. 12. See also Justin
Martyr, _Apol._ lib. i. sect. 72. The quotation from M. Felix is from the
Leipsic edit., 1847, pp. 41, 42.

_Sir Kenelm Digby_ (Vol. vii., p. 85.).--I am not at all convinced of the
accuracy of the statement made by your correspondent VANDYKE, "that Sir
Kenelm Digby is (VANDYKE believes _always_) represented with a sunflower by
his side." There are various prints of Sir Kenelm Digby at the British
Museum, which I have very recently examined, and I can find but one which
bears the device alluded to and which is placed, not "by the side of Sir
Kenelm Digby," but with other allegorical symbols, at the bottom of the
print. Nor do the _Private Memoirs_ (first published in 1827 by the late
Sir Harris Nicolas) contain anything to throw light on the supposed
adoption of this emblem by Sir Kenelm Digby.

P. C. S. S.

A correspondent signing himself VANDYKE asks, "Why is Sir Kenelm Digby
represented, I believe always, with a sunflower by his side?" The very
first portrait of Digby I turned to, in Lodge's _Collection_, engraved,
too, after Vandyke, is without any flower at all.

JAYDEE.

_Martin Drunk_ (Vol. v., p. 587.).--I cannot find that this phrase has been
satisfactorily elucidated. Perhaps the following will throw some additional
light on the subject.

In an _Analysis of the Gospels for the Lord's Days_, by Conrad Dieteric,
edit. 1631, p. 465., I read:

    "Tritum est illud veterum veriverbium:

     'Festa _Martini_ iterata,
      Absumunt anseres et prata.'

    Id quod Germanicus hunc in modum effert:

     'Wer all tag will S. Martin prassen,
      Der muss endlich S. Nicias fasten.'"

It would seem from this, that not the English alone were wont to enjoy
themselves on St. Martin's Day. Baxter, in his _Saint's Rest_ (p. 116. 1st
edit.), seems to use the word _Martin_ as synonymous with a noisy tippler:

    "The language of Martin is there a stranger, and the sound of his echo
    is not heard."

Internal evidence clearly refers all these sayings to the unrestrained
mirth and jollity with which the feast of St. Martin was anciently
celebrated.

_The Church Catechism_ (Vol. vii., p. 64.).--It might interest your
correspondent to know that the _Catechismus brevis et Catholicus_ of
Jacobus Schoepper (published at Antwerp, 1555), contains a remarkable
series of passages closely similar to the last twelve questions and answers
of the Church Catechism. If desired, I would send these "parallel
passages," as I expect the book is very scarce.

_Sham Epitaphs and Quotations_ (Vol. vi., p 340.).--Your correspondent A.
A. D. asks, in reference to a certain epitaph, "has it really a local
habitation, and where?" This is a Query full of grave suggestions. Are
there not hundreds of epitaphs in print which have no existence except as
printer's paragraphs, and which serve the same purpose as the immortal calf
with six legs, and the numberless gigantic gooseberries and plethoric
turnips. I have collected epitaphs for years past, and it is surprising how
many--and those some of the best in a literary sense--defy every attempt to
trace them to sepulchral sources. Besides epitaphs, I believe many sham
quotations are used by writers, such as couplets and queer phrases of their
own coining; but which are inclosed between inverted commas, either to rid
their authors of the responsibility of the sentiments they convey, or to
add weight to the argument they are introduced to illustrate. A short time
since, I contributed a tale to a journal; at the head of each chapter stood
a couplet of my own composing, which the printer and editor both mistook
for a series of quotations, and kindly affixed inverted commas to them;
and, as in that instance I did not receive proof slips to correct, the tale
was published, adorned with these sham quotations--the reader being
bamboozled without intention, and I robbed of the credit of my original
couplets. This is an important matter: for it is no pleasant affair to
spend a month or two in the endeavour to trace a quotation, and then to
become convinced that you have been hunting for a mare's nest.

_Door-head Inscription_ (Vol. vii., p. 23.).--In accordance with the
suggestion of A. B. R., I have by means of a friend obtained an accurate
transcript of the door-head inscription at Wymondham. It runs thus:

 "Nec mihi glis servus, nec hospes hirudo."

The doubts I felt, when I stated that I quoted from memory, related to the
first word or two; and it has proved that I was in error there. The
_hirudo_, however, must stand; although it is a question not easy to
decide, "whether a greedy or a gossiping guest would be the worst household
infliction."

six in a row; and were fired by a train of powder running from touch-hole
to touch-hole, as a part of the entertainment (a _feu-de-joie_, I suppose)
at the public grounds at Norwich some twenty years ago, as I remember.

    Little_. He took orders, and became vicar of Edgware, Middlesex; and he
    often preached from a folio volume of Tillotson's Sermons, which lay in
    the pulpit from week to week. He died of the small-pox. When living at
    Stanmore I heard much of his pleasantry, his politeness, and his
    integrity. I first read this book at the Rev. Dr. Davy's house in
    Norfolk, in August, 1816. This copy was most obligingly sent to me by
    Mr. Holmes, keeper of an academy at Stratford-upon-Avon, Thursday, Feb.

symbolical significance of the pelican "vulning its breast," as the heralds
have it, is well known. Some of these, which I remember well, have the beak
bent down upon the breast and beneath it, instead of the indications of
plumage elsewhere visible, a strip cross-hatched; in sign, as I have
supposed, of the flowing blood.

he need not have dissented from your account of the colloquy between
Elizabeth and Dean Nowell, as you clearly hinted that "similar inscriptions
had been _previously_ adopted" (Vol. vi., p. 511.). The colloquy occurred
in the fourth year of Elizabeth's reign; but, from the following extract,
her Majesty's proclamation was observed in Ireland two years previously:

    "In 1559, orders were sent to Thomas Lockwood, Dean of Christ Church,
    Dublin, to remove out of this church all relics and images, and to
    paint and whiten it anew; putting sentences of Scripture on the walls
    instead of pictures, which orders were observed, and men set to work
    accordingly on the 25th May of the same year, which was the second of

Hint, the "waiting wench" in Macklin's _Man of the World_, entertains
matrimonial designs on Sidney, the chaplain:

    "I wish she was out of the family once; if she was, I might then stand
    a chance of being my lady's favourite myself; ay, and perhaps of
    getting one of my young masters for a sweetheart, _or at least the

_Passage in Wordsworth_ (Vol. vii., p. 85.).--I can refer your Edinburgh

who published, in 1594, a volume of sonnets entitled _Diana_; and whose
"ambrosiac muse" is lauded by Ben Jonson in his _Underwoods_ (Gifford, vol.
viii. p. 390.):

 "The pen wherewith thou dost so heavenly singe,
  Made of a quill pluckt from an Angell's winge."

These lines, which I find in the notes to Todd's _Milton_ (vol. v. p. 454.,
edit. 1826), being addressed "To the King of Scots whom as yet he had not
seen," must have been written before 1603, and were first printed on a MS.
volume by Todd in his first edition, 1801; where Wordsworth, who was no
reader of scarce old tracts like "Diana Primrose's Chain of Pearl," may
very probably have seen them.

the time of marriage shall be considered legitimate; and that instances
have been known where children born out {192} of wedlock have been
legitimatised, on the marriage of their parents, by being placed beneath
the mother's apron, and having the string tied over them, during the
ceremony.

Perhaps some of your correspondents can give information as to whether such
a provision does, or did, exist in the Scotch marriage law.

_St. Adulph_ (Vol. vii., p. 84.).--_Trajectensem_ certainly applies to
either Utrecht or Maestricht. One was Trajectum ad Rhenum, the other
Trajectum ad Mosam. I incline to the opinion that the latter place is
intended: Utrecht being, I believe, generally expressed by Ultrajectum.

_La Bruyere_ (Vol. vii., pp. 38. 114.).--There lies before me an elaborate
MS. history of the family of Brewer, with a pedigree. The former, which
commences with Ralph de Bruera (temp. William I.), has been compiled from
papers in the Heralds' Office, Brompton, Dugdale, and the more modern
historians, general and local. The last individual mentioned therein is a
physician, who bore the name and ancient arms of Brewer, and died in 1618.
The pedigree embraces about sixty names, including the alliances, but
reaches no further downwards than the sons of Roger Mortimer in the reign
of Henry III. These documents do not contribute in any way to answer the
inquiry of one of your correspondents as to La Bruyere; and it may be
satisfactory to the other to know that there is nothing in them to show any
connexion with the name of De la Bruere.

_Murray, titular Earl of Dunbar_ (Vol. vi., p. 11.).--In correcting Lord
Albemarle's mistake respecting "James Murray, _titular_ Earl of Dunbar,"
your correspondent C. (2.), Portsmouth, seems to have fallen into a similar
error, which I hope he will pardon me for pointing out.

The Christian name of _Murray of Broughton_ was not _James_, but _John_;
and the ancient Border family to which he belonged was so distinctly
connected with that of Stormont (a branch of Tullibardine), that even
genealogical tradition was silent. His activity as an agent recommended him
to Prince Charles, who employed him as his secretary during the campaign of
1745, to the misfortunes of which he added by fomenting the Prince's
distrust of Lord George Murray: and his final treachery to his master and
his cause has condemned him to an immortality of infamy. He had nothing in
common with "James Earl of Dunbar," save the name which he disgraced and
the cause which he betrayed.

James Murray, second son of Lord Stormont, and elder brother of the famous
Lord Mansfield, escaped to the court of the exiled Stuarts after 1715. He
became governor to the prince; and under the title of Earl of Dunbar, chief
minister and secretary to his father. He never returned to Scotland, but
died in 1770 at Avignon, at the age of eighty. His honorable fidelity to a
ruined cause is admitted even by Junius, when, "willing to wound," he
taunts Mansfield with this Jacobite connexion; while the intensity of
loathing with which Scotland viewed his infamous namesake is illustrated by
the anecdote of old Walter Scott throwing the cup out of the window, lest
"lip of him, or his, should come after John Murray of Broughton."

_Loggerheads_ (Vol. v., p. 338.).--As I do not find that any correspondent
of "N. & Q." on the subject of the sign of "We Three" has mentioned the
existence of a similar sign in a small village in Denbighshire, on the
border of Flintshire, to which a curious tradition is attached, I am
induced to forward the account of it. The last years of Wilson, the
landscape painter (who died in 1782), were passed at a house called
Clomendu, the dove-cote, situated on a property to which he had succeeded
in the little village of Llanoerris, through which the high road from Mold,
his burial-place, to Ruthin passes. Wilson was fond of ale, and is {193}
traditionally said to have frequented a small inn close by the roadside (on
the right hand as you pass through the village from Mold towards the vale
of Clwyd), and to have spent many an hour upon the bench under a tree which
was lately, and is perhaps still standing opposite. His friend the
landlord, wanting a new sign, or more probably a restoration of the old
established one, Wilson painted for him the heads of two very merry
red-faced men, who are looking hard, with a broad grin, towards the
spectator. Long exposure to the wind and weather had, when I saw them,
nearly obliterated the original colouring of the heads, and I have heard
that some Dick Tinto has of late years restored the rubicund hue to their
cheeks: but the words "We Three Loggerheads Be" were quite legible ten
years ago. The innkeeper, who sets a very high value on this sign, is, I
believe, a son of the man for whom Wilson painted it. It is not attached to
a pole, but fastened against the front of the inn: and a few years ago, an
idea prevailing that "The Loggerheads" had been painted on the back of an
unfinished landscape, an artist offered the innkeeper a sum of money to be
allowed to take it down, and ascertain the fact. But it was indignantly
refused, with a protest that the sign which Wilson had painted should never
be removed from its place, as long as he lived.

_Parochial Libraries_ (Vol. vi., pp. 432. 559.).--An ancient parochial
library existed some seven or eight and twenty years ago at Gillingham in
Dorsetshire. I was for a short period at that time the _locum tenens_ of
the then rector of Gillingham; but at this distance of time remember
scarcely more than that the books were kept in a small room devoted to the
purpose in the rectory house, and were probably above two hundred in
number.

_St. Botulph_ (Vol. vii., p. 84.).--The life of St. Botulph, contained in
the Harleian MS. No. 3097., is by Fulcard, a monk of Thorney, as appears by
the dedication. It is the same as that printed by Capgrave, who omits the
dedication. Fulcard wrote the lives of certain other saints buried at
Thorney (Torhtred and Tancred). The dedication does not belong exclusively
to the life of Botulph, but forms the introduction to all three lives. It
was for this reason, I suppose, that Capgrave (or rather John of Tynemouth,
from whom he borrowed) omitted it.

"_Memoires d'un Homme d'Etat_" (Vol. vi., pp. 412. 588.).--There seems to
be sufficient reason for believing in the disavowal of Prince Hardenberg
being the author, made by his friend and agent Privy-Counsellor Schoell, to
whom the prince, at his death, had confided his genuine _Memoires_. M.
Schoell thought the best care would be taken of them by placing them under
the official safeguard of the Prussian minister; and his decision was, that
they were not to be published till after the lapse of fifty years from the
prince's death, which took place in 1822. Copies, however, of the original
_Memoires_ had been surreptitiously taken before their seclusion from the
public eye; and from these copies, important and extensive extracts are
said to have been undoubtedly made, and form part of the printed
_Memoires_. In editing them, several well-known literary men were employed;
among whom are enumerated, Alphonse de Beauchamp, A. Schubart, and Count A.
F. D'Allonville. A Mons. Montveran (the author, I believe, of a work on
English jurisprudence) announced, some years ago, a publication, in which
he promised to disclose the original sources of the _Memoires_ and the
compilers' names; but, so far as I can discover, M. Montveran has never
redeemed his promise.

problems was sent from India, in a letter addressed to the editor of the
_Chess Player's Chronicle_, signed "Shagird" (native Indian chess player).

It was published in the _Chronicle_ in 1846, vol. vi. p. 54., _without_ the
solution, which is as follows:

_Age of Trees_ (Vol. v., _passim_).--In the _Saturday Magazine_ of Dec. 29,
1832, mention is made {194} of Owen Glendower's Oak, at Shelton, near
Shrewsbury,--a tree famed from the tradition attached to it, which states
that the celebrated chieftain whose name it bears overlooked, from its
branches, the desperate battle which took place between Henry IV. and Sir
Henry Percy, on the 20th July, 1403.

    "There is no difficulty, in believing," says E. B., "from the present
    appearance of the tree, that it is old enough to have been of a
    considerable size in the year 1403. Oaks are known to live to a much
    greater age than this; and there are documents which prove that the
    Shelton Oak was a fine large tree some centuries ago. It is perfectly
    alive, and bears some hundreds of acorns every year, though it has
    great marks of age, and is so hollow in the inside, that it seems to
    stand on little more than a circle of bark. At least six or eight
    persons might stand within it.

    "The girth at the bottom, close to the ground, is 44 feet 3 inches; at
    five feet from the ground, 25 feet 1 inch; at eight feet from the
    ground, 27 feet 4 inches. Height of the tree, 41 feet 6 inches."

What is known of this old oak at the present time? If it has passed away,
perhaps its memory may claim a place in your columns: if not, will some of
your correspondents give me some information respecting it?

_Mummies in Germany_ (Vol. vi., _passim_).--In a large hall under the
Capuchin convent at Florian, and only ten minutes' walk from Valetta, there
is a collection of "baked friars," as so termed in common parlance at this
island.

The niches in the walls are all filled, and when one of the order now dies,
that mummy which has been the longest exposed, or most decayed, is removed
to make way for the remains of him who is lately deceased.

What with the appearance of these mummies, and the smell which comes from
them, one visit will satisfy the most curious in such matters.

Your correspondent CHEVERELLS will find a well-written description, in
Willis's _Pencillings by the Way_, of a visit which he made to the Capuchin
convent near Palermo.

PROPOSALS FOR REPAIR AND IMPROVEMENT OF

ST. MARY'S CHURCH,

VINCENT SQUARE, WESTMINSTER.

  _Incumbent._
  REV. A. BORRADAILE.
  _Churchwardens._
  MR. G. PEARSE.
  MR. G. PINK.

ST. MARY'S CHURCH, Vincent Square, Westminster, was erected in the year
1837, and contains 1,200 sittings, of which 800 are free.

The pecuniary resources which were at the disposal of those by whose
efforts this spacious Church was built were only adequate to provide what
was absolutely requisite for the performance of Divine Service.

There was, however, much cause for thankfulness that so large and
commodious a Church was raised in so poor a district as St. Mary's; and a
hope was then entertained that the day would soon come when what was
necessarily left incomplete might be accomplished.

Fifteen years have passed away since the Church was consecrated; and the
time appears now to have arrived when an effort should be made to supply
what is wanting, and to render the interior more convenient, to paint,
cleanse, and colour it; and to impart to it that religious decency and
comeliness which befits the House of God.

An additional reason for this endeavour is supplied by recent events.
Churches have arisen in the neighbourhood of St. Mary's, erected by the
munificence of pious founders, which are adorned with architectural beauty,
and are among the best specimens of ecclesiastical fabrics that the present
age has produced. St. Mary's suffers from the contrast: its deficiencies
have become more manifest; and the need of such an effort as has been
mentioned is now felt more strongly.

While, however, the exigencies of the case have increased, the means of
satisfying them have become less. Some of the less indigent portions of St.
Mary's District have been detached from it, and have been annexed to the
other districts formed for more recent Churches. Thus the resources of St.
Mary's have been diminished; and circumstances of a local character render
it undesirable, in the opinion of legal advisers, to press for the levying
of a Rate for the improvement of the Church. Perhaps, however, the strength
of the present appeal may eventually be found to lie in these difficulties,
when they are more generally known.

A COMMITTEE, therefore, has been formed, consisting of the Churchwardens of
the District, and other inhabitants, and of some personal friends of the
Incumbent, the REV. A. BORRADAILE, whose zeal and energy in discharging the
duties of the pastoral office in St. Mary's District for more than ten
years, through many and great difficulties, have been greatly blessed to
his flock, and command the respect and sympathy of those who have witnessed
his persevering exertions, and have seen the fruit of his labours.

The Committee are now engaged in an endeavour to raise funds for the
reparation and improvement of the interior of St. Mary's Church; and they
trust that many may be found to approve and encourage the design.

An estimate has been prepared of the requisite expenditure by MR. H. A.
HUNT, of 4. Parliament Street, which amounts to FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
POUNDS. This sum, it is anticipated, will suffice to provide for lowering
and refixing the whole of the Free Seats, and to make them more commodious
for the use of the poor; to improve the seats generally throughout the
Church; to alter and improve the position and character of the Pulpit and
Reading Desk; to paint, grain, and varnish the whole of the seats; and so
give an appropriate appearance to the Chancel of the Church.

THE PRACTICAL WORKING of THE CHURCH OF SPAIN. By the Rev. FREDERICK
MEYRICK, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.

    "Pleasant meadows, happy peasants, all holy monks, all holy priests,
    holy every body. Such charity and such unity, when every man was a
    Catholic. I once believed in this Utopia myself, but when tested by
    stern facts, it all melts away like dream"--_A. Welby Pugin._

    "The revelations made by such writers as Mr. Meyrick in Spain and Mr.
    Gladstone in Italy, have at least vindicated for the Church of England
    a providential and morally defined position, mission, and purpose in
    the Catholic Church."--_Morning Chronicle._

    "Two valuable works ... to the truthfulness of which we are glad to add
    our own testimony: one, and the most important, is Mr. Meyrick's
    'Practical Working of the Church of Spain.' This is the experience--and
    it is the experience of every Spanish traveller--of a thoughtful
    person, as to the lamentable results of unchecked Romanism. Here is the
    solid substantial fact. Spain is divided between ultra-infidelity and
    what is so closely akin to actual idolatry, that it can only be
    controversially, not practically, distinguished from it: and over all
    hangs a lurid cloud of systematic immorality, simply frightful to
    contemplate. We can offer a direct, and even personal, testimony to all
    that Mr. Meyrick has to say."--_Christian Remembrancer._

    "I wish to recommend it strongly."--T. K. _Arnold's Theological
    Critic._

    "Many passing travellers have thrown more or less light upon the state
    of Romanism and Christianity in Spain, according to their objects and
    opportunities; but we suspect these 'workings' are the fullest, the
    most natural, and the most trustworthy, of anything that has appeared
    upon the subject since the time of Blanco White's
    Confessions."--_Spectator._

    "This honest exposition of the practical working of Romanism in Spain,
    of its everyday effects, not its canons and theories, deserves the
    careful study of all, who, unable to test the question abroad, are
    dazzled by the distant mirage with which the Vatican mocks many a
    yearning soul that thirsts after water-brooks pure and
    full."--_Literary Gazette._

SYMPATHIES of the CONTINENT, or PROPOSALS for a NEW REFORMATION. By JOHN
BAPTIST VON HIRSCHER, D.D., Dean of the Metropolitan Church of Freiburg,
Breisgau, and Professor of Theology in the Roman Catholic University of the
City. Translated and edited with Notes and Introduction by the Rev. ARTHUR
CLEVELAND COXE, M.A., Rector of St. John's Church, Hartford, Connecticut,
U.S.

    "The following work will be found a noble apology for the position
    assumed by the Church of England in the sixteenth century, and for the
    practical reforms she then introduced into her theology and worship. If
    the author is right, then the changes he so eloquently urges upon the
    present attention of his brethren ought to have been made _three
    hundred years ago_; and the obstinate refusal of the Council of Trent
    to make such reforms in conformity with Scripture and Antiquity, throws
    the whole burthen of the sin of schism upon Rome, and not upon our
    Reformers. The value of such admissions must, of course, depend in a
    great measure upon the learning, the character, the position, and the
    influence of the author from whom they proceed. The writer believes,
    that questions as to these particulars can be most satisfactorily
    answered."--_Introduction by Arthur Cleveland Coxe._

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
