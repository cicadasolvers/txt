Book 02 Exodus
001:001 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt
        (every man and his household came with Jacob):
001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
001:004 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
001:005 All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls,
        and Joseph was in Egypt already.
001:006 Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.
001:007 The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
        and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land
        was filled with them.
001:008 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.
001:009 He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children
        of Israel are more and mightier than we.
001:010 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,
        and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join
        themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape
        out of the land."
001:011 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict
        them with their burdens.  They built storage cities
        for Pharaoh:  Pithom and Raamses.
001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied
        and the more they spread out.  They were grieved because of
        the children of Israel.
001:013 The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,
001:014 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar
        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field,
        all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
001:015 The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name
        of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,
001:016 and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife
        to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool;
        if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter,
        then she shall live."
001:017 But the midwives feared God, and didn't do what the king
        of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.
001:018 The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them,
        "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"
001:019 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women
        aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous,
        and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
001:020 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied,
        and grew very mighty.
001:021 It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he
        gave them families.
001:022 Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, "You shall cast every
        son who is born into the river, and every daughter you
        shall save alive."
002:001 A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi
        as his wife.
002:002 The woman conceived, and bore a son.  When she saw that he was
        a fine child, she hid him three months.
002:003 When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus
        basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch.
        She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by
        the river's bank.
002:004 His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.
002:005 Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river.
        Her maidens walked along by the riverside.  She saw the basket
        among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.
002:006 She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried.
        She had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of
        the Hebrews' children."
002:007 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go
        and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she
        may nurse the child for you?"
002:008 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." The maiden went and called
        the child's mother.
002:009 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away,
        and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."
        The woman took the child, and nursed it.
002:010 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter,
        and he became her son.  She named him Moses,{"Moses"
        sounds like the Hebrew for "draw out".} and said, "Because I
        drew him out of the water."
002:011 It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up,
        that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens.
        He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.
002:012 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
        was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
002:013 He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews
        were fighting with each other.  He said to him who did the wrong,
        "Why do you strike your fellow?"
002:014 He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us?  Do you plan
        to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"  Moses was afraid,
        and said, "Surely this thing is known."
002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses.
        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land
        of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters.
        They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water
        their father's flock.
002:017 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up
        and helped them, and watered their flock.
002:018 When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it
        that you have returned so early today?"
002:019 They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,
        and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
002:020 He said to his daughters, "Where is he?  Why is it that you
        have left the man?  Call him, that he may eat bread."
002:021 Moses was content to dwell with the man.  He gave
        Moses Zipporah, his daughter.
002:022 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,{"Gershom"
        sounds like the Hebrew for "an alien there."} for he said,
        "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
002:023 It happened in the course of those many days, that the king
        of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of
        the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God
        because of the bondage.
002:024 God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
002:025 God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.
003:001 Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,
        the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back
        of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb.
003:002 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out
        of the midst of a bush.  He looked, and behold, the bush
        burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
003:003 Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight,
        why the bush is not burnt."
003:004 When Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him
        out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses!  Moses!"  He said,
        "Here I am."
003:005 He said, "Don't come close.  Take your sandals off of your feet,
        for the place you are standing on is holy ground."
003:006 Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God
        of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
        Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
003:007 Yahweh said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are
        in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters,
        for I know their sorrows.
003:008 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land,
        to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place
        of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
003:009 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me.
        Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the
        Egyptians oppress them.
003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh,
        that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel,
        out of Egypt."
003:011 Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh,
        and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
        out of Egypt?"
003:012 He said, "Certainly I will be with you.  This will be the token
        to you, that I have sent you:  when you have brought forth
        the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
003:013 Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children
        of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has
        sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'
        What should I tell them?"
003:014 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and he said, "You shall tell
        the children of Israel this:  'I AM has sent me to you.'"
003:015 God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of
        Israel this, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
        the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.'
        This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.
003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them,
        'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
        and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely
        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;
003:017 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction
        of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite,
        the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        to a land flowing with milk and honey."'
003:018 They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and
        the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall
        tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.
        Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness,
        that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'
003:019 I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission
        to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
003:020 I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders
        which I will do in the midst of it, and after that he will
        let you go.
003:021 I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
        and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.
003:022 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits
        her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing;
        and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters.
        You shall despoil the Egyptians.
004:001 Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me,
        nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'Yahweh has not
        appeared to you.'"
004:002 Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?"
        He said, "A rod."
004:003 He said, "Throw it on the ground."  He threw it on the ground,
        and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
004:004 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail."
        He put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became
        a rod in his hand.
004:005 "That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
        the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
        has appeared to you."
004:006 Yahweh said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside
        your cloak."  He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took
        it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
004:007 He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again."
        He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out
        of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
004:008 "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen
        to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe
        the voice of the latter sign.
004:009 It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs,
        neither listen to your voice, that you shall take
        of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land.
        The water which you take out of the river will become blood
        on the dry land."
004:010 Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent,
        neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant;
        for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
004:011 Yahweh said to him, "Who made man's mouth?  Or who makes one mute,
        or deaf, or seeing, or blind?  Isn't it I, Yahweh?
004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach
        you what you shall speak."
004:013 He said, "Oh, Lord, please send someone else."
004:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and he said,
        "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite?  I know that he can
        speak well.  Also, behold, he comes forth to meet you.
        When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
004:015 You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth.
        I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
        you what you shall do.
004:016 He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen,
        that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.
004:017 You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall
        do the signs."
004:018 Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,
        and said to him, "Please let me go and return to my brothers
        who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive."
        Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
004:019 Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt;
        for all the men who sought your life are dead."
004:020 Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey,
        and he returned to the land of Egypt.  Moses took God's rod
        in his hand.
004:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you
        do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand,
        but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
004:022 You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh, Israel is
        my son, my firstborn,
004:023 and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;"
        and you have refused to let him go.  Behold, I will kill
        your son, your firstborn.'"
004:024 It happened on the way at a lodging place, that Yahweh met
        him and wanted to kill him.
004:025 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son,
        and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a
        bridegroom of blood to me."
004:026 So he let him alone.  Then she said, "You are a bridegroom
        of blood," because of the circumcision.
004:027 Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses."
        He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him.
004:028 Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had
        sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.
004:029 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
        of the children of Israel.
004:030 Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses,
        and did the signs in the sight of the people.
004:031 The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited
        the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction,
        then they bowed their heads and worshiped.
005:001 Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is
        what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go,
        that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"
005:002 Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice
        to let Israel go?  I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will
        not let Israel go."
005:003 They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us.
        Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness,
        and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us
        with pestilence, or with the sword."
005:004 The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron,
        take the people from their work?  Get back to your burdens!"
005:005 Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many,
        and you make them rest from their burdens."
005:006 The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people,
        and their officers, saying,
005:007 "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before.
        Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
005:008 The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require
        from them.  You shall not diminish anything of it, for they
        are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice
        to our God.'
005:009 Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein;
        and don't let them pay any attention to lying words."
005:010 The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
        and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says:
        "I will not give you straw.
005:011 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing
        of your work shall be diminished."
005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land
        of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
005:013 The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily,
        as when there was straw!"
005:014 The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's
        taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
        "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today,
        in making brick as before?"
005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
        to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?
005:016 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us,
        'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten;
        but the fault is in your own people."
005:017 But he said, "You are idle!  You are idle!  Therefore you say,
        'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'
005:018 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you,
        yet shall you deliver the same number of bricks!"
005:019 The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were
        in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything
        from your daily quota of bricks!"
005:020 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
        forth from Pharaoh:
005:021 and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge,
        because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes
        of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword
        in their hand to kill us."
005:022 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Lord, why have you brought
        trouble on this people?  Why is it that you have sent me?
005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has
        brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered
        your people at all."
006:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh,
        for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong
        hand he shall drive them out of his land."
006:002 God spoke to Moses, and said to him, "I am Yahweh;
006:003 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty;
        but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.
006:004 I have also established my covenant with them, to give them
        the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they
        lived as aliens.
006:005 Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
        whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered
        my covenant.
006:006 Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I
        will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
        and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem
        you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
006:007 and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you
        out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
006:008 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage:
        I am Yahweh.'"
006:009 Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen
        to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
006:010 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:011 "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children
        of Israel go out of his land."
006:012 Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel
        haven't listened to me.  How then shall Pharaoh listen to me,
        who am of uncircumcised lips?"
006:013 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge
        to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
006:014 These are the heads of their fathers' houses.  The sons of Reuben
        the firstborn of Israel:  Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi;
        these are the families of Reuben.
006:015 The sons of Simeon:  Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
        and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman;
        these are the families of Simeon.
006:016 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to
        their generations:  Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years
        of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.
006:017 The sons of Gershon:  Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
006:018 The sons of Kohath:  Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron,
        and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one
        hundred thirty-three years.
006:019 The sons of Merari:  Mahli and Mushi.  These are the families
        of the Levites according to their generations.
006:020 Amram took Jochebed his father's sister to himself as wife;
        and she bore him Aaron and Moses:  and the years of the life
        of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.
006:021 The sons of Izhar:  Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
006:022 The sons of Uzziel:  Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
006:023 Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab,
        the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab
        and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
006:024 The sons of Korah:  Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph;
        these are the families of the Korahites.
006:025 Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife;
        and she bore him Phinehas.  These are the heads of the fathers'
        houses of the Levites according to their families.
006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said,
        "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt
        according to their armies."
006:027 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt.
        These are that Moses and Aaron.
006:028 It happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the
        land of Egypt,
006:029 that Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "I am Yahweh.
        Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."
006:030 Moses said before Yahweh, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
        and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"
007:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh;
        and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
007:002 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother
        shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel
        go out of his land.
007:003 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
        wonders in the land of Egypt.
007:004 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt,
        and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel,
        out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
007:005 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch
        forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel
        from among them."
007:006 Moses and Aaron did so.  As Yahweh commanded them, so they did.
007:007 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old,
        when they spoke to Pharaoh.
007:008 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
007:009 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!'
        then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down
        before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"
007:010 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh
        had commanded:  and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh
        and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
007:011 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers.
        They also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner
        with their enchantments.
007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:
        but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
007:013 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;
        as Yahweh had spoken.
007:014 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn.
        He refuses to let the people go.
007:015 Go to Pharaoh in the morning.  Behold, he goes out to the water;
        and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him;
        and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take
        in your hand.
007:016 You shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent
        me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me
        in the wilderness:"  and behold, until now you haven't listened.
007:017 Thus says Yahweh, "In this you shall know that I am Yahweh.
        Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters
        which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
007:018 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall
        become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water
        from the river."'"
007:019 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod,
        and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,
        over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools,
        and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood;
        and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,
        both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
007:020 Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted
        up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river,
        in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants;
        and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
007:021 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul,
        and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river;
        and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
007:022 The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments;
        and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;
        as Yahweh had spoken.
007:023 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay
        even this to heart.
007:024 All the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink;
        for they couldn't drink of the water of the river.
007:025 Seven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.
008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him,
        "This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my people go, that they
        may serve me.
008:002 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your
        borders with frogs:
008:003 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come
        into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed,
        and into the house of your servants, and on your people,
        and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:
008:004 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people,
        and on all your servants.'"
008:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with
        your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools,
        and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'"
008:006 Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;
        and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
008:007 The magicians did in like manner with their enchantments,
        and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat Yahweh,
        that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people;
        and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh."
008:009 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting
        the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants,
        and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you
        and your houses, and remain in the river only."
008:010 He said, "Tomorrow." He said, "Be it according to your word,
        that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God.
008:011 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses,
        and from your servants, and from your people.  They shall
        remain in the river only."
008:012 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh
        concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.
008:013 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died
        out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
008:014 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened
        his heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
008:016 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod,
        and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.'"
008:017 They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
        and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man,
        and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout
        all the land of Egypt.
008:018 The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice,
        but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal.
008:019 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:"
        and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;
        as Yahweh had spoken.
008:020 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes forth to the water;
        and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says, "Let my people go,
        that they may serve me.
008:021 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
        of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people,
        and into your houses:  and the houses of the Egyptians shall be
        full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
008:022 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which
        my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there;
        to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst
        of the earth.
008:023 I will put a division between my people and your people:
        by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"
008:024 Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies
        into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses:
        and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason
        of the swarms of flies.
008:025 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to
        your God in the land!"
008:026 Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall
        sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God.
        Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
        before their eyes, and won't they stone us?
008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice
        to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us."
008:028 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh
        your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away.
        Pray for me."
008:029 Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray
        to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
        from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don't
        let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people
        go to sacrifice to Yahweh."
008:030 Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.
008:031 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms
        of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people.
        There remained not one.
008:032 Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let
        the people go.
009:001 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him,
        'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says:
        "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
009:002 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,
009:003 behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are
        in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels,
        on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.
009:004 Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel
        and the livestock of Egypt; and there shall nothing die
        of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"
009:005 Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh shall
        do this thing in the land."
009:006 Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock
        of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel,
        not one died.
009:007 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of
        the livestock of the Israelites dead.  But the heart of Pharaoh
        was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.
009:008 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls
        of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward
        the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
009:009 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall
        be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal,
        throughout all the land of Egypt."
009:010 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
        and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil
        breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.
009:011 The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils;
        for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.
009:012 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen
        to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.
009:013 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh,
        the God of the Hebrews, says:  "Let my people go, that they
        may serve me.
009:014 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart,
        against your officials, and against your people; that you
        may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
009:015 For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and
        your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off
        from the earth;
009:016 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand:
        to show you my power, and that my name may be declared
        throughout all the earth;
009:017 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't
        let them go.
009:018 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
        grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day
        it was founded even until now.
009:019 Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all
        that you have in the field be brought into shelter.
        Every man and animal that is found in the field,
        and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them,
        and they shall die."'"
009:020 Those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh
        made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.
009:021 Whoever didn't regard the word of Yahweh left his servants
        and his livestock in the field.
009:022 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward the sky,
        that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man,
        and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the
        land of Egypt."
009:023 Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh
        sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth.
        Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.
009:024 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail,
        such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it
        became a nation.
009:025 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
        in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every
        herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
        there was no hail.
009:027 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them,
        "I have sinned this time.  Yahweh is righteous, and I and my
        people are wicked.
009:028 Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings
        and hail.  I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
009:029 Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city,
        I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh.  The thunders
        shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you
        may know that the earth is Yahweh's.
009:030 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet
        fear Yahweh God."
009:031 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear,
        and the flax was in bloom.
009:032 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had
        not grown up.
009:033 Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
        his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased,
        and the rain was not poured on the earth.
009:034 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
        were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart,
        he and his servants.
009:035 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn't let the children
        of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.
010:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened
        his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show
        these my signs in the midst of them,
010:002 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son,
        and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt,
        and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know
        that I am Yahweh."
010:003 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him,
        "This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says:
        'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me?
        Let my people go, that they may serve me.
010:004 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I
        will bring locusts into your country,
010:005 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one
        won't be able to see the earth.  They shall eat the residue
        of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail,
        and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.
010:006 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all
        your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians;
        as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen,
        since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'"
        He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
010:007 Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare
        to us?  Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God.
        Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
010:008 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said
        to them, "Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those
        who will go?"
010:009 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old;
        with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
        our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh."
010:010 He said to them, "Yahweh be with you if I will let you go
        with your little ones!  See, evil is clearly before your faces.
010:011 Not so!  Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is
        what you desire!"  They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
010:012 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land
        of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land
        of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
        the hail has left."
010:013 Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,
        and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day,
        and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind
        brought the locusts.
010:014 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
        in all the borders of Egypt.  They were very grievous.
        Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after
        them shall be such.
010:015 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that
        the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land,
        and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left.
        There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field,
        through all the land of Egypt.
010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said,
        "I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.
010:017 Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh
        your God, that he may also take away from me this death."
010:018 He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.
010:019 Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up
        the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
        There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
010:020 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let
        the children of Israel go.
010:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky,
        that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness
        which may be felt."
010:022 Moses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was
        a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
010:023 They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his
        place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light
        in their dwellings.
010:024 Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve Yahweh.
        Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind.
        Let your little ones also go with you."
010:025 Moses said, "You must also give into our hand sacrifices
        and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.
010:026 Our livestock also shall go with us.  There shall not a hoof
        be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh
        our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh,
        until we come there."
010:027 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go.
010:028 Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me!  Be careful to see my
        face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
010:029 Moses said, "You have spoken well.  I will see your face
        again no more."
011:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring
        on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go.
        When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether.
011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every
        man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor,
        jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
011:003 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
        Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,
        in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
        of the people.
011:004 Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says:  'About midnight I
        will go out into the midst of Egypt,
011:005 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,
        from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to
        the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill;
        and all the firstborn of livestock.
011:006 There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
        such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.
011:007 But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't
        even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal;
        that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between
        the Egyptians and Israel.
011:008 All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down
        themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people
        who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'"
        He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
011:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my
        wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
011:010 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh
        hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children
        of Israel go out of his land.
012:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
012:002 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months.
        It shall be the first month of the year to you.
012:003 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth
        day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb,
        according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household;
012:004 and if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and
        his neighbor next to his house shall take one according
        to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can
        eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old.
        You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
012:006 and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month;
        and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall
        kill it at evening.
012:007 They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts
        and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.
012:008 They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire,
        and unleavened bread.  They shall eat it with bitter herbs.
012:009 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted
        with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.
012:010 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;
        but that which remains of it until the morning you shall
        burn with fire.
012:011 This is how you shall eat it:  with your waist girded,
        your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand;
        and you shall eat it in haste:  it is Yahweh's Passover.
012:012 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike
        all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal.
        Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments:
        I am Yahweh.
012:013 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are:
        and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there
        shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike
        the land of Egypt.
012:014 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep
        it a feast to Yahweh:  throughout your generations you shall
        keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
012:015 "'Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first
        day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever
        eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day,
        that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
012:016 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation,
        and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work
        shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat,
        that only may be done by you.
012:017 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
        same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
        therefore shall you observe this day throughout your generations
        by an ordinance forever.
012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening,
        you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day
        of the month at evening.
012:019 Seven days shall there be no yeast found in your houses,
        for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut
        off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner,
        or one who is born in the land.
012:020 You shall eat nothing leavened.  In all your habitations you
        shall eat unleavened bread.'"
012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them,
        "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families,
        and kill the Passover.
012:022 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that
        is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts
        with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall
        go out of the door of his house until the morning.
012:023 For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when
        he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts,
        Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer
        to come in to your houses to strike you.
012:024 You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to
        your sons forever.
012:025 It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh
        will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall
        keep this service.
012:026 It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean
        by this service?'
012:027 that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover,
        who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
        when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'"
        The people bowed their heads and worshiped.
012:028 The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded
        Moses and Aaron, so they did.
012:029 It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn
        in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his
        throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon;
        and all the firstborn of livestock.
012:030 Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
        and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt,
        for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
012:031 He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up,
        get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel;
        and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!
012:032 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said,
        and be gone; and bless me also!"
012:033 The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out
        of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead men."
012:034 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading
        troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
012:035 The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
        and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels
        of gold, and clothing.
012:036 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
        so that they let them have what they asked.
        They despoiled the Egyptians.
012:037 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth,
        about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.
012:038 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds,
        and even very much livestock.
012:039 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
        forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they
        were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they
        prepared for themselves any food.
012:040 Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was
        four hundred thirty years.
012:041 It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years,
        even the same day it happened, that all the armies of Yahweh
        went out from the land of Egypt.
012:042 It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them
        out from the land of Egypt.  This is that night of Yahweh,
        to be much observed of all the children of Israel
        throughout their generations.
012:043 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance
        of the Passover.  There shall no foreigner eat of it,
012:044 but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you
        have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
012:045 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth
        anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall
        you break a bone of it.
012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
012:048 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you,
        and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males
        be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it;
        and he shall be as one who is born in the land:
        but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
012:049 One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger
        who lives as a foreigner among you."
012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel.  As Yahweh commanded
        Moses and Aaron, so they did.
012:051 It happened the same day, that Yahweh brought the children
        of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
013:002 "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb
        among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal.
        It is mine."
013:003 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you
        came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
        strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place.
        No leavened bread shall be eaten.
013:004 This day you go forth in the month Abib.
013:005 It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of
        the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you,
        a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this
        service in this month.
013:006 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
        day shall be a feast to Yahweh.
013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days;
        and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall
        there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.
013:008 You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of
        that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.'
013:009 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial
        between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth;
        for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.
013:010 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from
        year to year.
013:011 "It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land
        of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers,
        and shall give it you,
013:012 that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb,
        and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal.
        The males shall be Yahweh's.
013:013 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb;
        and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck;
        and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.
013:014 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying,
        'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand
        Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage;
013:015 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,
        that Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
        both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal.
        Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb,
        being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
013:016 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between
        your eyes:  for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth
        out of Egypt."
013:017 It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
        didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,
        although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people
        change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;"
013:018 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness
        by the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}; and the children of Israel
        went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
013:019 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made
        the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you,
        and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."
013:020 They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
        in the edge of the wilderness.
013:021 Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud,
        to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire,
        to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
013:022 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night,
        didn't depart from before the people.
014:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
014:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp
        before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon.
        You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.
014:003 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled
        in the land.  The wilderness has shut them in.'
014:004 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them;
        and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies;
        and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh."
        They did so.
014:005 It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled;
        and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed
        towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done,
        that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
014:006 He made ready his chariot, and took his army with him;
014:007 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
        of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
014:008 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children
        of Israel went out with a high hand.
014:009 The Egyptians pursued after them:  all the horses and chariots
        of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them
        encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
014:010 When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up
        their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them;
        and they were very afraid.  The children of Israel cried
        out to Yahweh.
014:011 They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt,
        have you taken us away to die in the wilderness?
        Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
014:012 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying,
        'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?'  For it
        were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we
        should die in the wilderness."
014:013 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid.  Stand still, and see
        the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today:
        for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never
        see them again.
014:014 Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still."
014:015 Yahweh said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me?  Speak to the children
        of Israel, that they go forward.
014:016 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea,
        and divide it:  and the children of Israel shall go into
        the midst of the sea on dry ground.
014:017 I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
        and they shall go in after them:  and I will get myself honor
        over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots,
        and over his horsemen.
014:018 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have
        gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots,
        and over his horsemen."
014:019 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel,
        moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved
        from before them, and stood behind them.
014:020 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there
        was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night:
        and the one didn't come near the other all the night.
014:021 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused
        the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night,
        and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
014:022 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on
        the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their
        right hand, and on their left.
014:023 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst
        of the sea:  all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots,
        and his horsemen.
014:024 It happened in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked out on
        the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud,
        and confused the Egyptian army.
014:025 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily;
        so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel,
        for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!"
014:026 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea,
        that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots,
        and on their horsemen."
014:027 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned
        to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
        fled against it.  Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst
        of the sea.
014:028 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen,
        even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea.
        There remained not so much as one of them.
014:029 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of
        the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand,
        and on their left.
014:030 Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
        and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
014:031 Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians,
        and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh,
        and in his servant Moses.
015:001 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh,
        and said, "I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
        The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
015:002 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
        This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God,
        and I will exalt him.
015:003 Yahweh is a man of war.  Yahweh is his name.
015:004 He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea.
        His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
015:005 The deeps cover them.  They went down into the depths
        like a stone.
015:006 Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power.
        Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.
015:007 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those
        who rise up against you.  You send forth your wrath.
        It consumes them as stubble.
015:008 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.
        The floods stood upright as a heap.  The deeps were congealed
        in the heart of the sea.
015:009 The enemy said, 'I will pursue.  I will overtake.
        I will divide the spoil.  My desire shall be satisfied on them.
        I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
015:010 You blew with your wind.  The sea covered them.
        They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
015:011 Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods?  Who is like you,
        glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
015:012 You stretched out your right hand.  The earth swallowed them.
015:013 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you
        have redeemed.  You have guided them in your strength
        to your holy habitation.
015:014 The peoples have heard.  They tremble.  Pangs have taken hold
        on the inhabitants of Philistia.
015:015 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.  Trembling takes hold
        of the mighty men of Moab.  All the inhabitants of Canaan
        are melted away.
015:016 Terror and dread falls on them.  By the greatness of your arm
        they are as still as a stone--until your people pass over,
        Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.
015:017 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain
        of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made
        for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your
        hands have established.
015:018 Yahweh shall reign forever and ever."
015:019 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
        his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters
        of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry
        land in the midst of the sea.
015:020 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine
        in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines
        and with dances.
015:021 Miriam answered them, "Sing to Yahweh, for he has
        triumphed gloriously.  The horse and his rider he has thrown
        into the sea."
015:022 Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went
        three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
015:023 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters
        of Marah, for they were bitter.  Therefore the name of it
        was called Marah.{Marah means bitter.}
015:024 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
015:025 Then he cried to Yahweh.  Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw
        it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.
        There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there
        he tested them;
015:026 and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of
        Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes,
        and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all
        his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I
        have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."
015:027 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water,
        and seventy palm trees:  and they encamped there by the waters.
016:001 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
        of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin,
        which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second
        month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
016:002 The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
        against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
016:003 and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we
        had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt,
        when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread,
        for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill
        this whole assembly with hunger."
016:004 Then said Yahweh to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from
        the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather
        a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they
        will walk in my law, or not.
016:005 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare
        that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much
        as they gather daily."
016:006 Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening,
        then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from
        the land of Egypt;
016:007 and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of Yahweh;
        because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh.
        Who are we, that you murmur against us?"
016:008 Moses said, "Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening,
        and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears
        your murmurings which you murmur against him.  And who are we?
        Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."
016:009 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the
        children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has
        heard your murmurings.'"
016:010 It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the
        children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,
        and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.
016:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:012 "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.
        Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat,
        and in the morning you shall be filled with bread:
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"
016:013 It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp;
        and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
016:014 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of
        the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost
        on the ground.
016:015 When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another,
        "What is it?"  For they didn't know what it was.
        Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given
        you to eat."
016:016 This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded:
        "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head,
        according to the number of your persons, shall you take it,
        every man for those who are in his tent."
016:017 The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
016:018 When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much
        had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.
        They gathered every man according to his eating.
016:019 Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."
016:020 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left
        of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul:
        and Moses was angry with them.
016:021 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according
        to his eating.  When the sun grew hot, it melted.
016:022 It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,
        two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation
        came and told Moses.
016:023 He said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken,
        'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh.
        Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you
        want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves
        to be kept until the morning.'"
016:024 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it
        didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it.
016:025 Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh.
        Today you shall not find it in the field.
016:026 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath.
        In it there shall be none."
016:027 It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went
        out to gather, and they found none.
016:028 Yahweh said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my
        commandments and my laws?
016:029 Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath,
        therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.
        Everyone stay in his place.  Let no one go out of his place
        on the seventh day."
016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.
016:031 The house of Israel called the name of it Manna,{"Manna"
        means "What is it?"} and it was like coriander seed, white;
        and its taste was like wafers with honey.
016:032 Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded,
        'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations,
        that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness,
        when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"
016:033 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full
        of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept
        throughout your generations."
016:034 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony,
        to be kept.
016:035 The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they
        came to an inhabited land.  They ate the manna until they
        came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
017:001 All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled
        from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to
        Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there
        was no water for the people to drink.
017:002 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water
        to drink."  Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me?
        Why do you test Yahweh?"
017:003 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured
        against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt,
        to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
017:004 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "What shall I do with these people?
        They are almost ready to stone me."
017:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take
        the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand
        with which you struck the Nile, and go.
017:006 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb.
        You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it,
        that the people may drink."  Moses did so in the sight
        of the elders of Israel.
017:007 He called the name of the place Massah,{Massah means testing.}
        and Meribah,{Meribah means quarreling.} because the children
        of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying,
        "Is Yahweh among us, or not?"
017:008 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
017:009 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out,
        fight with Amalek.  Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill
        with God's rod in my hand."
017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek;
        and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
017:011 It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed;
        and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
017:012 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
        under him, and he sat on it.  Aaron and Hur held up his hands,
        the one on the one side, and the other on the other side.
        His hands were steady until sunset.
017:013 Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
017:014 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book,
        and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:  that I will utterly
        blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky."
017:015 Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Yahweh
        our Banner.{Hebrew, Yahweh Nissi}
017:016 He said, "Yah has sworn:  'Yahweh will have war with Amalek
        from generation to generation.'"
018:001 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of
        all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
        how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.
018:002 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife,
        after he had sent her away,
018:003 and her two sons.  The name of one son was Gershom,{"Gershom"
        sounds like the Hebrew for "an alien there."} for Moses said,
        "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land".
018:004 The name of the other was Eliezer,{Eliezer means "God is my
        helper."} for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered
        me from Pharaoh's sword."
018:005 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his
        wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped,
        at the Mountain of God.
018:006 He said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come
        to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.
018:007 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him.
        They asked each other of their welfare, and they came
        into the tent.
018:008 Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh
        and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships
        that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.
018:009 Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done
        to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand
        of the Egyptians.
018:010 Jethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out
        of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh;
        who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
018:011 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of
        the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them."
018:012 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices
        for God.  Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel,
        to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
018:013 It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people,
        and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.
018:014 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people,
        he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people?
        Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you
        from morning to evening?"
018:015 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come
        to me to inquire of God.
018:016 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man
        and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God,
        and his laws."
018:017 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do
        is not good.
018:018 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people
        that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you.
        You are not able to perform it yourself alone.
018:019 Listen now to my voice.  I will give you counsel, and God
        be with you.  You represent the people before God, and bring
        the causes to God.
018:020 You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall
        show them the way in which they must walk, and the work
        that they must do.
018:021 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men,
        such as fear God:  men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place
        such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,
        rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
018:022 Let them judge the people at all times.  It shall be that every
        great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter
        they shall judge themselves.  So shall it be easier for you,
        and they shall share the load with you.
018:023 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you
        will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go
        to their place in peace."
018:024 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did
        all that he had said.
018:025 Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
        over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,
        rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
018:026 They judged the people at all times.  They brought the hard
        causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
018:027 Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into
        his own land.
019:001 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone
        forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came
        into the wilderness of Sinai.
019:002 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to
        the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness;
        and there Israel encamped before the mountain.
019:003 Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain,
        saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob,
        and tell the children of Israel:
019:004 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore
        you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
019:005 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant,
        then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples;
        for all the earth is mine;
019:006 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.'
        These are the words which you shall speak to the children
        of Israel."
019:007 Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set
        before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.
019:008 All the people answered together, and said, "All that Yahweh
        has spoken we will do."  Moses reported the words of the
        people to Yahweh.
019:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud,
        that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe
        you forever."  Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.
019:010 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them
        today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
019:011 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh
        will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.
019:012 You shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, 'Be careful
        that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border.
        Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.
019:013 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or
        shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.'
        When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."
019:014 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified
        the people; and they washed their clothes.
019:015 He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day.
        Don't have sexual relations with a woman."
019:016 It happened on the third day, when it was morning,
        that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud
        on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet;
        and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
019:017 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they
        stood at the lower part of the mountain.
019:018 Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended
        on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace,
        and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
019:019 When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke,
        and God answered him by a voice.
019:020 Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.
        Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
019:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, charge the people, lest they
        break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.
019:022 Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves,
        lest Yahweh break forth on them."
019:023 Moses said to Yahweh, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai,
        for you charged us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain,
        and sanctify it.'"
019:024 Yahweh said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you,
        but don't let the priests and the people break through to come
        up to Yahweh, lest he break forth on them."
019:025 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
020:001 God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters "Aleph Tav"
        (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet), not as a word,
        but as a grammatical marker.} spoke all these words, saying,
020:002 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
        out of the house of bondage.
020:003 You shall have no other gods before me.
020:004 "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything
        that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath,
        or that is in the water under the earth:
020:005 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them,
        for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
        of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth
        generation of those who hate me,
020:006 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
        and keep my commandments.
020:007 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain,
        for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
020:008 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
020:009 You shall labor six days, and do all your work,
020:010 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God.
        You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son,
        nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant,
        nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;
020:011 for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea,
        and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day;
        therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
020:012 "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
020:013 "You shall not murder.
020:014 "You shall not commit adultery.
020:015 "You shall not steal.
020:016 "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
020:017 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house.  You shall
        not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant,
        nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey,
        nor anything that is your neighbor's."
020:018 All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings,
        the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.
        When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.
020:019 They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen;
        but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."
020:020 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has
        come to test you, and that his fear may be before you,
        that you won't sin."
020:021 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick
        darkness where God was.
020:022 Yahweh said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children
        of Israel:  'You yourselves have seen that I have talked
        with you from heaven.
020:023 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver,
        or gods of gold for yourselves.
020:024 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice
        on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,
        your sheep and your oxen.  In every place where I record
        my name I will come to you and I will bless you.
020:025 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build
        it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool on it,
        you have polluted it.
020:026 Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness
        may not be exposed to it.'
021:001 "Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.
021:002 "If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in
        the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.
021:003 If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself.
        If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.
021:004 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters,
        the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall
        go out by himself.
021:005 But if the servant shall plainly say, 'I love my master,
        my wife, and my children.  I will not go out free;'
021:006 then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him
        to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore
        his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.
021:007 "If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall
        not go out as the male servants do.
021:008 If she doesn't please her master, who has married
        her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.
        He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people,
        seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.
021:009 If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her after
        the manner of daughters.
021:010 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish
        her food, her clothing, and her marital rights.
021:011 If he doesn't do these three things for her, she may go free
        without paying any money.
021:012 "One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be
        put to death,
021:013 but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen:
        then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.
021:014 If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor
        to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
021:015 "Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely
        put to death.
021:016 "Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found
        in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
021:017 "Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely
        be put to death.
021:018 "If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone,
        or with his fist, and he doesn't die, but is confined to bed;
021:019 if he rises again and walks around with his staff,
        then he who struck him shall be cleared:  only he shall pay
        for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing
        until he is thoroughly healed.
021:020 "If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod,
        and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.
021:021 Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall
        not be punished, for he is his property.
021:022 "If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives
        birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely
        fined as much as the woman's husband demands and the judges allow.
021:023 But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,
021:024 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
021:025 burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
021:026 "If a man strikes his servant's eye, or his maid's eye,
        and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
021:027 If he strikes out his male servant's tooth, or his female
        servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
021:028 "If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall
        surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten;
        but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.
021:029 But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it
        has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in,
        but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned,
        and its owner shall also be put to death.
021:030 If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption
        of his life whatever is laid on him.
021:031 Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,
        according to this judgment it shall be done to him.
021:032 If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant,
        thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master,
        and the ox shall be stoned.
021:033 "If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn't cover it,
        and a bull or a donkey falls into it,
021:034 the owner of the pit shall make it good.  He shall give money
        to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his.
021:035 "If one man's bull injures another's, so that it dies,
        then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price;
        and they shall also divide the dead animal.
021:036 Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring
        in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely
        pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own.
022:001 "If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it;
        he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
022:002 If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies,
        there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him.
022:003 If the sun has risen on him, there shall be guilt of bloodshed
        for him; he shall make restitution.  If he has nothing,
        then he shall be sold for his theft.
022:004 If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it
        is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double.
022:005 "If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets
        his animal loose, and it grazes in another man's field,
        he shall make restitution from the best of his own field,
        and from the best of his own vineyard.
022:006 "If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks
        of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed;
        he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
022:007 "If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep,
        and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found,
        he shall pay double.
022:008 If the thief isn't found, then the master of the house shall
        come near to God, to find out if he hasn't put his hand
        to his neighbor's goods.
022:009 For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey,
        for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing,
        about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of both parties
        shall come before God.  He whom God condemns shall pay double
        to his neighbor.
022:010 "If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep,
        or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away,
        no man seeing it;
022:011 the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both, whether he hasn't
        put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it
        shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
022:012 But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution
        to the owner of it.
022:013 If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence.
        He shall not make good that which was torn.
022:014 "If a man borrows anything of his neighbor's, and it is injured,
        or dies, the owner of it not being with it, he shall
        surely make restitution.
022:015 If the owner of it is with it, he shall not make it good.
        If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.
022:016 "If a man entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married,
        and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to
        be his wife.
022:017 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall
        pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
022:018 "You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
022:019 "Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.
022:020 "He who sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only,
        shall be utterly destroyed.
022:021 "You shall not wrong an alien, neither shall you oppress him,
        for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
022:022 "You shall not take advantage of any widow or fatherless child.
022:023 If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me,
        I will surely hear their cry;
022:024 and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword;
        and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
022:025 "If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor,
        you shall not be to him as a creditor; neither shall you
        charge him interest.
022:026 If you take your neighbor's garment as collateral, you shall
        restore it to him before the sun goes down,
022:027 for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin.
        What would he sleep in?  It will happen, when he cries to me,
        that I will hear, for I am gracious.
022:028 "You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
022:029 "You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from
        the outflow of your presses.  "You shall give the firstborn
        of your sons to me.
022:030 You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep.
        Seven days it shall be with its mother, then on the eighth
        day you shall give it me.
022:031 "You shall be holy men to me, therefore you shall not
        eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field.
        You shall cast it to the dogs.
023:001 "You shall not spread a false report.  Don't join your hand
        with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
023:002 You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; neither shall you
        testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice;
023:003 neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause.
023:004 "If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray,
        you shall surely bring it back to him again.
023:005 If you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under
        his burden, don't leave him, you shall surely help him with it.
023:006 "You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
023:007 "Keep far from a false charge, and don't kill the innocent
        and righteous:  for I will not justify the wicked.
023:008 "You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have
        sight and perverts the words of the righteous.
023:009 "You shall not oppress an alien, for you know the heart of an alien,
        seeing you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
023:010 "For six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather
        in its increase,
023:011 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow,
        that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave
        the animal of the field shall eat.  In like manner you shall
        deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove.
023:012 "Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you
        shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest,
        and the son of your handmaid, and the alien may be refreshed.
023:013 "Be careful to do all things that I have said to you;
        and don't invoke the name of other gods, neither let them
        be heard out of your mouth.
023:014 "You shall observe a feast to me three times a year.
023:015 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread.
        Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you,
        at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came
        out from Egypt), and no one shall appear before me empty.
023:016 And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors,
        which you sow in the field:  and the feast of harvest,
        at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out
        of the field.
023:017 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before
        the Lord Yahweh.
023:018 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread,
        neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night
        until the morning.
023:019 The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring
        into the house of Yahweh your God.  "You shall not boil a kid
        in its mother's milk.
023:020 "Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way,
        and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
023:021 Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice.
        Don't provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience,
        for my name is in him.
023:022 But if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak,
        then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary
        to your adversaries.
023:023 For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite,
        the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.
023:024 You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them,
        nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow
        them and demolish their pillars.
023:025 You shall serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless your bread
        and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst.
023:026 No one will miscarry or be barren in your land.
        I will fulfill the number of your days.
023:027 I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people
        to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn
        their backs to you.
023:028 I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite,
        the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you.
023:029 I will not drive them out from before you in one year,
        lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field
        multiply against you.
023:030 Little by little I will drive them out from before you,
        until you have increased and inherit the land.
023:031 I will set your border from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} even to
        the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River;
        for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand,
        and you shall drive them out before you.
023:032 You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
023:033 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin
        against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely
        be a snare to you."
024:001 He said to Moses, "Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab,
        and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship
        from a distance.
024:002 Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come near,
        neither shall the people go up with him."
024:003 Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh, and all
        the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice,
        and said, "All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do."
024:004 Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and rose up early
        in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain,
        and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
024:005 He sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt
        offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Yahweh.
024:006 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half
        of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
024:007 He took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing
        of the people, and they said, "All that Yahweh has spoken
        will we do, and be obedient."
024:008 Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people,
        and said, "Look, this is the blood of the covenant,
        which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words."
024:009 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders
        of Israel went up.
024:010 They saw the God of Israel.  Under his feet was like a paved work
        of sapphire{or, lapis lazuli} stone, like the skies for clearness.
024:011 He didn't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel.
        They saw God, and ate and drank.
024:012 Yahweh said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain,
        and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone
        with the law and the commands that I have written, that you
        may teach them."
024:013 Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up
        onto God's Mountain.
024:014 He said to the elders, "Wait here for us, until we come
        again to you.  Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you.
        Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them."
024:015 Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
024:016 The glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud
        covered it six days.  The seventh day he called to Moses
        out of the midst of the cloud.
024:017 The appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on
        the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.
024:018 Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up
        on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days
        and forty nights.
025:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
025:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they take an offering for me.
        From everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall
        take my offering.
025:003 This is the offering which you shall take from them:
        gold, silver, brass,
025:004 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,
025:005 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,
025:006 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for
        the sweet incense,
025:007 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and
        for the breastplate.
025:008 Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
025:009 According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tent,
        and the pattern of all of its furniture, even so you
        shall make it.
025:010 "They shall make an ark of acacia wood.  Its length shall
        be two and a half cubits, its breadth a cubit and a half,
        and a cubit and a half its height.
025:011 You shall overlay it with pure gold.  Inside and outside shall
        you overlay it, and shall make a gold molding around it.
025:012 You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them
        in its four feet.  Two rings shall be on the one side of it,
        and two rings on the other side of it.
025:013 You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
025:014 You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark
        to carry the ark.
025:015 The poles shall be in the rings of the ark.  They shall not
        be taken from it.
025:016 You shall put the testimony which I shall give you into the ark.
025:017 You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold.  Two and a half cubits
        shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
025:018 You shall make two cherubim of hammered gold.  You shall make
        them at the two ends of the mercy seat.
025:019 Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end.
        You shall make the cherubim on its two ends of one piece
        with the mercy seat.
025:020 The cherubim shall spread out their wings upward, covering the mercy
        seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another.
        The faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat.
025:021 You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark
        you shall put the testimony that I will give you.
025:022 There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above
        the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are
        on the ark of the testimony, all that I command you for
        the children of Israel.
025:023 "You shall make a table of acacia wood.  Two cubits shall
        be its length, and a cubit its breadth, and one and a half
        cubits its height.
025:024 You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a gold
        molding around it.
025:025 You shall make a rim of a handbreadth around it.
        You shall make a golden molding on its rim around it.
025:026 You shall make four rings of gold for it, and put the rings
        in the four corners that are on its four feet.
025:027 the rings shall be close to the rim, for places for the poles
        to carry the table.
025:028 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them
        with gold, that the table may be carried with them.
025:029 You shall make its dishes, its spoons, its ladles, and its bowls
        to pour out offerings with.  Of pure gold shall you make them.
025:030 You shall set bread of the presence on the table before me always.
025:031 "You shall make a lampstand of pure gold.  Of hammered work shall
        the lampstand be made, even its base, its shaft, its cups,
        its buds, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.
025:032 There shall be six branches going out of its sides:
        three branches of the lampstand out of its one side,
        and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;
025:033 three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud
        and a flower; and three cups made like almond blossoms in
        the other branch, a bud and a flower, so for the six branches
        going out of the lampstand;
025:034 and in the lampstand four cups made like almond blossoms,
        its buds and its flowers;
025:035 and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud
        under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two
        branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going
        out of the lampstand.
025:036 Their buds and their branches shall be of one piece with it,
        the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.

        and when he comes out, that he not die.
028:036 "You shall make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on it,
        like the engravings of a signet, 'HOLY TO YAHWEH.'
028:037 You shall put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be on the sash;

        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
028:042 You shall make them linen breeches to cover the flesh
        of their nakedness; from the waist even to the thighs
        they shall reach:
028:043 They shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they go in to
        the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar
        to minister in the holy place; that they don't bear iniquity,
        and die:  it shall be a statute forever to him and to his
        descendants after him.
029:001 "This is the thing that you shall do to them to make
        them holy, to minister to me in the priest's office:
        take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
029:002 unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil,
        and unleavened wafers anointed with oil:  you shall make them
        of fine wheat flour.
029:003 You shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket,
        with the bull and the two rams.
029:004 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent
        of meeting, and shall wash them with water.
029:005 You shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat,

        and dress him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod;
029:006 and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy
        crown on the turban.
029:007 Then you shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head,
        and anoint him.
029:008 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.
029:009 You shall dress them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind
        headbands on them:  and they shall have the priesthood
        by a perpetual statute:  and you shall consecrate Aaron
        and his sons.
029:010 "You shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting:
        and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head
        of the bull.
029:011 You shall kill the bull before Yahweh, at the door of the
        tent of meeting.
029:012 You shall take of the blood of the bull, and put it on the horns
        of the altar with your finger; and you shall pour out all
        the blood at the base of the altar.
029:013 You shall take all the fat that covers the innards, the cover
        of the liver, the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them,
        and burn them on the altar.
029:014 But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung,
        you shall burn with fire outside of the camp:
        it is a sin offering.
029:015 "You shall also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall
        lay their hands on the head of the ram.
029:016 You shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood,
        and sprinkle it around on the altar.
029:017 You shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its innards,
        and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.
029:018 You shall burn the whole ram on the altar:  it is a burnt
        offering to Yahweh; it is a sweet savor, an offering made
        by fire to Yahweh.
029:019 "You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall
        lay their hands on the head of the ram.
029:020 Then you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood,
        and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on
        the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb
        of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot,
        and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.
029:021 You shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the
        anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments,
        and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him:
        and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and his sons,
        and his sons' garments with him.
029:022 Also you shall take some of the ram's fat, the fat tail,
        the fat that covers the innards, the cover of the liver,
        the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the right thigh
        (for it is a ram of consecration),
029:023 and one loaf of bread, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer
        out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh.
029:024 You shall put all of this in Aaron's hands, and in his sons'
        hands, and shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
029:025 You shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar
        on the burnt offering, for a sweet savor before Yahweh:
        it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
029:026 "You shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration,
        and wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh:
        and it shall be your portion.
029:027 You shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh
        of the wave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up,
        of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,
        and of that which is for his sons:
029:028 and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever
        from the children of Israel; for it is a wave offering:
        and it shall be a wave offering from the children of Israel
        of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their wave
        offering to Yahweh.
029:029 "The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him,
        to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.
029:030 Seven days shall the son who is priest in his place put
        them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister
        in the holy place.
029:031 "You shall take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh
        in a holy place.
029:032 Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread
        that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.
029:033 They shall eat those things with which atonement was made,
        to consecrate and sanctify them:  but a stranger shall not eat
        of it, because they are holy.
029:034 If anything of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread,
        remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire:
        it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
029:035 "Thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all
        that I have commanded you.  Seven days shall you consecrate them.
029:036 Every day shall you offer the bull of sin offering for atonement:
        and you shall cleanse the altar, when you make atonement for it;
        and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
029:037 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it:
        and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar
        shall be holy.
029:038 "Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar:
        two lambs a year old day by day continually.
029:039 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb
        you shall offer at evening:
029:040 and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine
        flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil,
        and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
029:041 The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it
        according to the meal offering of the morning, and according
        to its drink offering, for a sweet savor, an offering made
        by fire to Yahweh.
029:042 It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
        generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh,
        where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.
029:043 There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place
        shall be sanctified by my glory.
029:044 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar:
        Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to minister to me
        in the priest's office.
029:045 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
029:046 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them
        forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them:
        I am Yahweh their God.
030:001 "You shall make an altar to burn incense on.  You shall make
        it of acacia wood.
030:002 Its length shall be a cubit, and its breadth a cubit.
        It shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits.
        Its horns shall be of one piece with it.
030:003 You shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, the sides
        of it around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold
        molding around it.
030:004 You shall make two golden rings for it under its molding;
        on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make them;
        and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it.
030:005 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay
        them with gold.
030:006 You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony,
        before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I
        will meet with you.
030:007 Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning.
        When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.
030:008 When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it,
        a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations.
030:009 You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering,
        nor meal offering; and you shall pour no drink offering on it.
030:010 Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once in the year;
        with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year
        he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations.
        It is most holy to Yahweh."
030:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
030:012 "When you take a census of the children of Israel, according to
        those who are numbered among them, then each man shall give
        a ransom for his soul to Yahweh, when you number them;
        that there be no plague among them when you number them.
030:013 They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who
        are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary;
        (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an
        offering to Yahweh.
030:014 Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty
        years old and upward, shall give the offering to Yahweh.
030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less,
        than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Yahweh,
        to make atonement for your souls.
030:016 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel,
        and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting;
        that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh,
        to make atonement for your souls."
030:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
030:018 "You shall also make a basin of brass, and the base of it
        of brass, in which to wash.  You shall put it between the tent
        of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
030:019 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.
030:020 When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water,
        that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister,
        to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die:
        and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him
        and to his descendants throughout their generations."
030:022 Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
030:023 "Also take fine spices:  of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels;
        and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty;
        and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;
030:024 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary;
        and a hin of olive oil.
030:025 You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded
        after the art of the perfumer:  it shall be a holy anointing oil.
030:026 You shall use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark
        of the testimony,
030:027 the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories,
        the altar of incense,
030:028 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin
        with its base.
030:029 You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy.
        Whatever touches them shall be holy.
030:030 You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them,
        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
030:031 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'This shall
        be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.
030:032 It shall not be poured on man's flesh, neither shall you make
        any like it, according to its composition:  it is holy.
        It shall be holy to you.
030:033 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it
        on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.'"
030:034 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin,
        and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense:
        of each shall there be an equal weight;
030:035 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art
        of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:
030:036 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before
        the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you.
        It shall be to you most holy.
030:037 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition
        you shall not make for yourselves:  it shall be to you
        holy for Yahweh.
030:038 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall
        be cut off from his people."
031:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:002 "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri,
        the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
031:003 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom,
        and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
        manner of workmanship,
031:004 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver,
        and in brass,
031:005 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood,
        to work in all manner of workmanship.
031:006 I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son
        of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all
        who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make
        all that I have commanded you:
031:007 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat
        that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,
031:008 the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels,
        the altar of incense,
031:009 the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin
        and its base,
031:010 the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest--
        the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office,
031:011 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for
        the holy place:  according to all that I have commanded you
        they shall do."
031:012 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:013 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly
        you shall keep my Sabbaths:  for it is a sign between me
        and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I
        am Yahweh who sanctifies you.
031:014 You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you.
        Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death;
        for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut
        off from among his people.
031:015 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath
        of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh.  Whoever does any work on
        the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
031:016 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath,
        to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations,
        for a perpetual covenant.
031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever;
        for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh
        day he rested, and was refreshed.'"
031:018 He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on
        Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets,
        written with God's finger.
032:001 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from
        the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron,
        and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us;
        for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land
        of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."
032:002 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in
        the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,
        and bring them to me."
032:003 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears,
        and brought them to Aaron.
032:004 He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an
        engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said,
        "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of
        the land of Egypt."
032:005 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
        a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh."
032:006 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings,
        and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat
        and to drink, and rose up to play.
032:007 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you
        brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!
032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them.
        They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it,
        and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods,
        Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"
032:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold,
        they are a stiff-necked people.
032:010 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot
        against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make
        of you a great nation."
032:011 Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your
        wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought
        forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with
        a mighty hand?
032:012 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth
        for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them
        from the surface of the earth?'  Turn from your fierce wrath,
        and repent of this evil against your people.
032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants,
        to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them,
        'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all
        this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed,
        and they shall inherit it forever.'"
032:014 Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do
        to his people.
032:015 Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two
        tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were
        written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
        they were written.
032:016 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing
        of God, engraved on the tables.
032:017 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
        he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."
032:018 He said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory,
        neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome;
        but the noise of those who sing that I hear."
032:019 It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw
        the calf and the dancing:  and Moses' anger grew hot,
        and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them
        beneath the mountain.
032:020 He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire,
        ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made
        the children of Israel drink of it.
032:021 Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you,
        that you have brought a great sin on them?"
032:022 Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot.
        You know the people, that they are set on evil.
032:023 For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us;
        for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land
        of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'
032:024 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:'
        so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire,
        and out came this calf."
032:025 When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron
        had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),
032:026 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is
        on Yahweh's side, come to me!"  All the sons of Levi gathered
        themselves together to him.
032:027 He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every man
        put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate
        to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother,
        and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"
032:028 The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
        and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
032:029 Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man
        against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow
        on you a blessing this day."
032:030 It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people,
        "You have sinned a great sin.  Now I will go up to Yahweh.
        Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."
032:031 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned
        a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.
032:032 Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot
        me out of your book which you have written."
032:033 Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me,
        him will I blot out of my book.
032:034 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have
        spoken to you.  Behold, my angel shall go before you.
        Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them
        for their sin."
032:035 Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf,
        which Aaron made.
033:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and
        the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt,
        to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'
033:002 I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite,
        the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite:
033:003 to a land flowing with milk and honey:  for I will not go
        up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people,
        lest I consume you in the way."
033:004 When the people heard this evil news, they mourned:
        and no one put on his jewelry.
033:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are
        a stiff-necked people.  If I were to go up into your midst
        for one moment, I would consume you.  Therefore now take off
        your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"
033:006 The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry
        from Mount Horeb onward.
033:007 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp,
        far away from the camp, and he called it "The tent of meeting."
        It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent
        of meeting, which was outside the camp.
033:008 It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all
        the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door,
        and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.
033:009 It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar
        of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent,
        and spoke with Moses.
033:010 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door
        of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped,
        everyone at their tent door.
033:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.
        He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua,
        the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.
033:012 Moses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:'
        and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me.
        Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found
        favor in my sight.'
033:013 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight,
        please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I
        may find favor in your sight:  and consider that this nation
        is your people."
033:014 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
033:015 He said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me,
        don't carry us up from here.
033:016 For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight,
        I and your people?  Isn't it in that you go with us,
        so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people
        who are on the surface of the earth?"
033:017 Yahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you
        have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know
        you by name."
033:018 He said, "Please show me your glory."
033:019 He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you,
        and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you.
        I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show
        mercy on whom I will show mercy."
033:020 He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see
        me and live."
033:021 Yahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you
        shall stand on the rock.
033:022 It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you
        in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until
        I have passed by;
033:023 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back;
        but my face shall not be seen."
034:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first:
        and I will write on the tablets the words that were on
        the first tablets, which you broke.
034:002 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai,
        and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.
034:003 No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen
        throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds
        feed before that mountain."
034:004 He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose
        up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh
        had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.
034:005 Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
        and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.
034:006 Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh!  Yahweh, a
        merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant
        in loving kindness and truth,
034:007 keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity
        and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear
        the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children,
        and on the children's children, on the third and on
        the fourth generation."
034:008 Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
034:009 He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord,
        please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this
        is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin,
        and take us for your inheritance."
034:010 He said, "Behold, I make a covenant:  before all your people I
        will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth,
        nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall
        see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I
        do with you.
034:011 Observe that which I command you this day.  Behold, I drive
        out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite,
        the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
034:012 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants
        of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare
        in the midst of you:
034:013 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces
        their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;
034:014 for you shall worship no other god:  for Yahweh, whose name
        is Jealous, is a jealous God.
034:015 Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
        lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice
        to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;
034:016 and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters
        play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play
        the prostitute after their gods.
034:017 You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
034:018 "You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread.
        Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you,
        at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month
        Abib you came out from Egypt.
034:019 All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock
        that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
034:020 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb:
        and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.
        All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.
        No one shall appear before me empty.
034:021 "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest:
        in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
034:022 You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits
        of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year's end.
034:023 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before
        the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.
034:024 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders;
        neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear
        before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.
034:025 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
        neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover
        be left to the morning.
034:026 You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground
        to the house of Yahweh your God.  You shall not boil a young
        goat in its mother's milk."
034:027 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write you these words:
        for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant
        with you and with Israel."
034:028 He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights;
        he neither ate bread, nor drank water.  He wrote on the tablets
        the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
034:029 It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two
        tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down
        from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin
        of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
034:030 When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin
        of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.
034:031 Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the
        congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.
034:032 Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave
        them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him
        on Mount Sinai.
034:033 When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
034:034 But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him,
        he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out,
        and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
034:035 The children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses'
        face shone:  and Moses put the veil on his face again,
        until he went in to speak with him.
035:001 Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        and said to them, "These are the words which Yahweh has commanded,
        that you should do them.
035:002 'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
        be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh:
        whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.
035:003 You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on
        the Sabbath day.'"
035:004 Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        saying, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded, saying,
035:005 'Take from among you an offering to Yahweh.  Whoever is
        of a willing heart, let him bring it, Yahweh's offering:
        gold, silver, brass,
035:006 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,
035:007 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,
035:008 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for
        the sweet incense,
035:009 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and
        for the breastplate.
035:010 "'Let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all
        that Yahweh has commanded:
035:011 the tent, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards,
        its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
035:012 the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;
035:013 the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread;
035:014 the lampstand also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps,
        and the oil for the light;
035:015 and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil,
        the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door
        of the tent;
035:016 the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass,
        it poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base;
035:017 the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets,
        and the screen for the gate of the court;
035:018 the pins of the tent, the pins of the court, and their cords;
035:019 the finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place,
        the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments
        of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.'"
035:020 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from
        the presence of Moses.
035:021 They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone
        whom his spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh's offering,
        for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all of its service,
        and for the holy garments.
035:022 They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted,
        and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets,
        all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering
        of gold to Yahweh.
035:023 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet,
        fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea
        cow hides, brought them.
035:024 Everyone who did offer an offering of silver and brass brought
        Yahweh's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia
        wood for any work of the service, brought it.
035:025 All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands,
        and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple,
        the scarlet, and the fine linen.
035:026 All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
        the goats' hair.
035:027 The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set,
        for the ephod and for the breastplate;
035:028 and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil,
        and for the sweet incense.
035:029 The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh;
        every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring
        for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses.
035:030 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, Yahweh has
        called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
        of the tribe of Judah.
035:031 He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom,
        in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
035:032 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass,
035:033 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood,
        to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship.
035:034 He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab,
        the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
035:035 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
        of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman,
        and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet,
        and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do
        any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
036:001 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man,
        in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know
        how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary,
        according to all that Yahweh has commanded."
036:002 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man,
        in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom, even everyone whose
        heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it:
036:003 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children
        of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary,
        with which to make it.  They brought yet to him freewill
        offerings every morning.
036:004 All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary,
        each came from his work which they did.
036:005 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough
        for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make."
036:006 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
        throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman
        make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary."
        So the people were restrained from bringing.
036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,
        and too much.
036:008 All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made
        the tent with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple,
        and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman,
        they made them.
036:009 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits,
        and the breadth of each curtain four cubits.  All the curtains
        had one measure.
036:010 He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five
        curtains he coupled one to another.
036:011 He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from
        the edge in the coupling.  Likewise he made in the edge
        of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.
036:012 He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops
        in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling.
        The loops were opposite one to another.
036:013 He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one
        to another with the clasps:  so the tent was a unit.
036:014 He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tent.
        He made them eleven curtains.
036:015 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four
        cubits the breadth of each curtain.  The eleven curtains
        had one measure.
036:016 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
        by themselves.
036:017 He made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was
        outmost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops on the edge
        of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.
036:018 He made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together,
        that it might be a unit.
036:019 He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
        and a covering of sea cow hides above.
036:020 He made the boards for the tent of acacia wood, standing up.
036:021 Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half
        the breadth of each board.
036:022 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another.
        He made all the boards of the tent this way.
036:023 He made the boards for the tent:  twenty boards for the
        south side southward.
036:024 He made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;
        two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets
        under another board for its two tenons.
036:025 For the second side of the tent, on the north side,
        he made twenty boards,
036:026 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board,
        and two sockets under another board.
036:027 For the far part of the tent westward he made six boards.
036:028 He made two boards for the corners of the tent in the far part.
036:029 They were double beneath, and in like manner they were all
        the way to the top of it to one ring.  He did thus to both
        of them in the two corners.
036:030 There were eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
        sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
036:031 He made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one
        side of the tent,
036:032 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tent, and five
        bars for the boards of the tent for the hinder part westward.
036:033 He made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards
        from the one end to the other.
036:034 He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold
        for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
036:035 He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen:
        with cherubim.  He made it the work of a skillful workman.
036:036 He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold.
        Their hooks were of gold.  He cast four sockets of silver for them.
036:037 He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet,
        and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;
036:038 and the five pillars of it with their hooks.  He overlaid
        their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five
        sockets were of brass.
037:001 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood.  Its length was two
        and a half cubits, and its breadth a cubit and a half,
        and a cubit and a half its height.
037:002 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made
        a molding of gold for it round about.
037:003 He cast four rings of gold for it, in its four feet; even two
        rings on its one side, and two rings on its other side.
037:004 He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
037:005 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark,
        to bear the ark.
037:006 He made a mercy seat of pure gold.  Its length was two and a
        half cubits, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
037:007 He made two cherubim of gold.  He made them of beaten work,
        at the two ends of the mercy seat;
037:008 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end.
        He made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at
        its two ends.
037:009 The cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy
        seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another.
        The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
037:010 He made the table of acacia wood.  Its length was two cubits,
        and its breadth was a cubit, and its height was a cubit
        and a half.
037:011 He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.
037:012 He made a border of a handbreadth around it, and made a golden
        molding on its border around it.
037:013 He cast four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four
        corners that were on its four feet.
037:014 The rings were close by the border, the places for the poles
        to carry the table.
037:015 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold,
        to carry the table.
037:016 He made the vessels which were on the table, its dishes,
        its spoons, its bowls, and its pitchers with which to pour out,
        of pure gold.
037:017 He made the lampstand of pure gold.  He made the lampstand
        of beaten work.  Its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds,
        and its flowers were of one piece with it.
037:018 There were six branches going out of its sides:
        three branches of the lampstand out of its one side,
        and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side:
037:019 three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch,
        a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond
        blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower:
        so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
037:020 In the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms,
        its buds and its flowers;
037:021 and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud
        under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two
        branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going
        out of it.
037:022 Their buds and their branches were of one piece with it.
        The whole thing was one beaten work of pure gold.
037:023 He made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes,
        of pure gold.
037:024 He made it of a talent of pure gold, with all its vessels.
037:025 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood.  It was square:
        its length was a cubit, and its breadth a cubit.
        Its height was two cubits.  Its horns were of one piece with it.
037:026 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides around it,
        and its horns.  He made a gold molding around it.
037:027 He made two golden rings for it under its molding crown,
        on its two ribs, on its two sides, for places for poles
        with which to carry it.
037:028 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
037:029 He made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices,
        after the art of the perfumer.
038:001 He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood.  It was square.
        Its length was five cubits, its breadth was five cubits,
        and its height was three cubits.
038:002 He made its horns on its four corners.  Its horns were of one
        piece with it, and he overlaid it with brass.
038:003 He made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, the shovels,
        the basins, the forks, and the fire pans.  He made all its
        vessels of brass.
038:004 He made for the altar a grating of a network of brass,
        under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up.
038:005 He cast four rings for the four ends of brass grating,
        to be places for the poles.
038:006 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass.
038:007 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar,
        with which to carry it.  He made it hollow with planks.
038:008 He made the basin of brass, and its base of brass, out of
        the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door
        of the tent of meeting.
038:009 He made the court:  for the south side southward the hangings
        of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits;
038:010 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
038:011 For the north side one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty,
        and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars,
        and their fillets, of silver.
038:012 For the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten,
        and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars,
        and their fillets, of silver.
038:013 For the east side eastward fifty cubits.
038:014 The hangings for the one side were fifteen cubits;
        their pillars three, and their sockets three;
038:015 and so for the other side:  on this hand and that hand
        by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits;
        their pillars three, and their sockets three.
038:016 All the hangings around the court were of fine twined linen.
038:017 The sockets for the pillars were of brass.  The hooks of the
        pillars and their fillets were of silver; and the overlaying
        of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court
        were filleted with silver.
038:018 The screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer,
        of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.
        Twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
        was five cubits, like to the hangings of the court.
038:019 Their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass;
        their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals,
        and their fillets, of silver.
038:020 All the pins of the tent, and around the court, were of brass.
038:021 This is the amount of material used for the tent, even the Tent
        of the Testimony, as they were counted, according to
        the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites,
        by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
038:022 Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
        made all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
038:023 With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,
        an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue,
        in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen.
038:024 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work
        of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering,
        was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary.
038:025 The silver of those who were numbered of the congregation
        was one hundred talents, and one thousand seven hundred
        seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
038:026 a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel
        of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who
        were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six
        hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men.
038:027 The one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets
        of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; one hundred
        sockets for the one hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
038:028 Of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels
        he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals,
        and made fillets for them.
038:029 The brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand
        four hundred shekels.
038:030 With this he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting,
        the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, all the vessels
        of the altar,
038:031 the sockets around the court, the sockets of the gate of the court,
        all the pins of the tent, and all the pins around the court.
039:001 Of the blue, purple, and scarlet, they made finely worked garments,
        for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments
        for Aaron; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:002 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine
        twined linen.
039:003 They beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires,
        to work it in the blue, in the purple, in the scarlet,
        and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.
039:004 They made shoulder straps for it, joined together.
        At the two ends it was joined together.
039:005 The skillfully woven band that was on it, with which to
        fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its work;
        of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:006 They worked the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold,
        engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names
        of the children of Israel.
039:007 He put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, to be stones
        of memorial for the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:008 He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful workman,
        like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet,
        and fine twined linen.
039:009 It was square.  They made the breastplate double.
        Its length was a span, and its breadth a span, being double.
039:010 They set in it four rows of stones.  A row of ruby, topaz,
        and beryl was the first row;
039:011 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire{or, lapis lazuli},
        and an emerald;
039:012 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
039:013 and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper.
        They were enclosed in gold settings.
039:014 The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel,
        twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet,
        everyone according to his name, for the twelve tribes.
039:015 They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided
        work of pure gold.
039:016 They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put
        the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
039:017 They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings
        at the ends of the breastplate.
039:018 The other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the
        two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod,
        in the front of it.
039:019 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
        of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was toward
        the side of the ephod inward.
039:020 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder
        straps of the ephod underneath, in the front of it, close by
        its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
039:021 They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod
        with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven
        band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come
        loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:022 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
039:023 The opening of the robe in the midst of it was like the opening
        of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening,
        that it should not be torn.
039:024 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue,
        purple, scarlet, and twined linen.
039:025 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
        the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe,
        between the pomegranates;
039:026 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the
        skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:027 They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron,
        and for his sons,
039:028 and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen,
        and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,
039:029 and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        the work of the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:030 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold,
        and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet:
        "HOLY TO YAHWEH."
039:031 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:032 Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished.
        The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses; so they did.
039:033 They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture,
        its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
039:034 the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea
        cow hides, the veil of the screen,
039:035 the ark of the testimony with its poles, the mercy seat,
039:036 the table, all its vessels, the show bread,
039:037 the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order,
        all its vessels, the oil for the light,
039:038 the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense,
        the screen for the door of the Tent,
039:039 the bronze altar, its grating of brass, its poles, all of
        its vessels, the basin and its base,
039:040 the hangings of the court, its pillars, its sockets,
        the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, its pins,
        all the instruments of the service of the tent, for the
        tent of meeting,
039:041 the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place,
        the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments
        of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
039:042 According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children
        of Israel did all the work.
039:043 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it
        as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it:
        and Moses blessed them.
040:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
040:002 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent
        of the Tent of Meeting.
040:003 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall
        screen the ark with the veil.
040:004 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things
        that are on it.  You shall bring in the lampstand, and light
        the lamps of it.
040:005 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark
        of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tent.
040:006 You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door
        of the tent of the tent of meeting.
040:007 You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar,
        and shall put water therein.
040:008 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen
        of the gate of the court.
040:009 You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all
        that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture:
        and it will be holy.
040:010 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels,
        and sanctify the altar:  and the altar will be most holy.
040:011 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.
040:012 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent
        of meeting, and shall wash them with water.
040:013 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall
        anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me
        in the priest's office.
040:014 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.
040:015 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father,
        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
        Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood
        throughout their generations."
040:016 Moses did so.  According to all that Yahweh commanded him,
        so he did.
040:017 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first
        day of the month, that the tent was raised up.
040:018 Moses raised up the tent, and laid its sockets, and set up
        the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised
        up its pillars.
040:019 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof
        of the tent above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:020 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles
        on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.
040:021 He brought the ark into the tent, and set up the veil
        of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:022 He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of
        the tent northward, outside of the veil.
040:023 He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:024 He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table,
        on the side of the tent southward.
040:025 He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:026 He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil;
040:027 and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh
        commanded Moses.
040:028 He put up the screen of the door to the tent.
040:029 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent
        of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering
        and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:030 He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar,
        and put water therein, with which to wash.
040:031 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.
040:032 When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came
        near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
040:033 He raised up the court around the tent and the altar,
        and set up the screen of the gate of the court.
        So Moses finished the work.
040:034 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory
        of Yahweh filled the tent.
040:035 Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the
        cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tent.
040:036 When the cloud was taken up from over the tent, the children
        of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;
040:037 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel
        until the day that it was taken up.
040:038 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire
        in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,
        throughout all their journeys.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
