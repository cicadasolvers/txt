TERMS AND DIRECTIONS.


      _A Loop_, written L; 2 _Loops_, written 2 L, and so on.

      _Single stitches_--Are formed in two ways: First, by
         letting the thread of the shuttle with which you
         are working fall over the back of the hand and
         pushing the shuttle from you. Secondly, by letting
         the thread of the shuttle with which you are
         working fall over the palm of the hand, and putting
         the shuttle through _towards_ you. These two
         stitches worked together alternately make a _Double
         stitch_. But if the second be worked first and the
         first second, alternately, it makes a _Reversed
         Double_. This is used for the purpose of making all
         the work have a right and wrong side.

     _2 Threads_--When 2 threads are used, twist the one
         with which the stitches are to be made round the
         little finger, and proceed as above.

     _Double stitch_, written D; 2 _Double stitches_,
         written 2 D, &c.

     _Reversed Double stitch_, written R D; 2 _Reversed
         Double stitches_, written 2 R D, &c.

     _Loops_--Are made by putting the thread with which
         double stitches are made over a pin, and there must
         be _one_ or more _Double stitches_ between each
         loop. By holding the pin point towards the right
         hand, between the forefinger and thumb of the left,
         the thread can be lifted over by the 2nd finger of
         the right hand, and many loops made without
         removing it. With reversed double stitches, the
         thread is lifted over by the shuttle as the 2nd
         stitch is being made. Loops can also be made by
         putting the shuttle thread over the pin.

     _Ovals_--Form the cotton of the shuttle you are
         directed to work with into a loop round the hand,
         and begin working the stitches. If composed of
         double stitches only (with perhaps one loop in the
         centre), it is called a _plain oval_. If of several
         loops, a _looped oval_.

     _A Join_--Is always made by drawing the thread with
         which the stitches are worked through the specified
         loop or space, and passing the shuttle through the
         loop formed by the thread thus drawn through,
         making it equal in length to an ordinary loop. To
         make a join, 2 threads or an oval are necessary.

     _To Tie_--This is done by drawing the thread on the
         shuttle with which you are working through the
         specified loop or space (or round some thread), and
         putting the same shuttle through the loop so
         formed, always drawing it _quite_ tight. It may
         sometimes be necessary to do this with the other
         thread; but it is done in the same way, with _one_
         thread _only_, and always drawn quite tight.

     _To Attach_--Proceed as in tying--only pass the shuttle
         round the _second thread_ before putting it through
         the loop, and drawing tight. This ties in the
         _second thread_, which cannot be so securely done
         by ordinary joining.

the space near the 1st stitch, and tying.


_To work in the centre._

Take a piece of No. 8 cotton; draw it, in loops, through each of the 12
centre loops of the ovals, and pass the other end of this cotton 3 times
through each loop--fasten off.


_For the foundation of the vandykes._

_Fill the plain shuttle with No. 8_, and measure off 2 lengths of 1 1/2
yards each; tie the 3 ends together. With the 1st length twisted round
the little finger work 2 D, L, 2 D, then put the second round the little
finger, leave a little space, and work 2 R D, L, 2 R D; repeat until
there are 66 Ls on each side. Fasten it neatly into a circle, by untying

working with the figured shuttle thread round the little finger. 3 D, L,
3 D tie to the last L of plain shuttle thread, 3 D. Begin a plain oval

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
