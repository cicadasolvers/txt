The New York Evening Journal, through its National and International

outside the Hearst organization.

attracted the largest readership of any evening newspaper in the United
States on the sound principle of greatest service to the greatest number
of men and women in every substantial walk of life.

_New York Evening Journal_]

Mr. Brisbane writes editorials for the New York Evening Journal and has
done so for many years. His daily editorials are one of the outstanding
reasons why nearly half of all the people in Metropolitan New York, who
buy any New York evening paper, buy the New York Evening Journal every
day.




ACCURACY

THE FIRST LAW OF THE NEWS

"_Get it_ FIRST, _but first get it_ RIGHT"

THE SLOGAN OF

New York Evening Journal News Gathering Staff


All through its local news staff as well as through the International
News Service Staff the gospel of GET IT RIGHT is stressed and reiterated
twenty-four hours in the day. The man who can't get the habit of
ACCURACY can't stay in this organization though he be the most brilliant
writer living. "_Get it_ FIRST but _first_ get it RIGHT" is at once a
fearless challenge and a solemn pledge of faith.

NEWS PICTURES

WHAT THE CAMERA'S EYE SEES


One good picture is worth ten thousand words, says an old proverb. The
Evening Journal is invariably FIRST in serving its readers with
accurate, informative, illuminating and exclusive news pictures. Each
picture must pass the scrutiny of the most critical staff of experts to
be good enough for reproduction in the Evening Journal. New Yorkers know
they get better and more interesting pictures in the Evening Journal
than in any other New York newspaper.




_SPEED_

MEANS LIFE TO THE NEWS


_You may have the news beat of a century on your desk. Hold it a half
hour too long--long enough for another paper to print it_ FIRST--_and
for you it is_ YESTERDAY'S NEWS _with all the_ LIFE _ebbed out of it._

The News Policy of the NEW YORK EVENING JOURNAL can be summarized in
five sentences:

_Give all the vital news of the moment._
  _Give it cleanly._
    _Give it accurately._
      _Give it interestingly._
        _Give it succinctly._

Back of this clean-cut, vigorous policy of news presentation is the
finest reportorial and editorial talent that money can buy.

Local news printed in the New York Evening Journal is furnished by the
most adequate staff of reporters and special writers retained by any
evening newspaper in the city.

Telegraphic news is furnished by the International News Service--with
well equipped offices not only in New York but in Washington, London,
Paris, Rome, Moscow, Peking--with expert representatives all over the
world. In New York City's evening newspaper field International News
Service serves the New York Evening Journal _exclusively_.




LARGEST AND HIGHEST PAID LOCAL NEWS STAFF IN NEW YORK CITY


"Get it FIRST, but first get it RIGHT"--that is the slogan of the New
York Evening Journal's news-gathering staff. This newspaper employs the
largest staff of men and women reporters, photographers, and news
writers of any evening newspaper in America. It pays the highest
salaries and this policy attracts the most capable and brilliant talent.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE REPORTS NEWS OF THE WORLD FOR EVENING JOURNAL
READERS


International News Service has firmly established itself as the dominant
press service in the afternoon newspaper field. Its news dispatches,
gathered from every corner of the universe, likewise are published in
newspapers throughout the civilized world. International News Service is
truly international in scope, linking the foremost nations in a
comprehensive news-gathering and news-distributing chain.

Approximately 60,000 miles of leased wire, used and controlled by
International News Service, distributes its news reports to the Evening
Journal alone in New York and to more than 500 other daily newspapers in
the United States. By cable and radio International News Service
dispatches are sent to sixteen foreign nations in both hemispheres.
Editors of the leading newspapers in Germany, Great Britain, Italy,
Spain, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and
numerous other countries place the same reliance upon the International
News Service reports as do the editors of leading American afternoon
dailies.

International News Service is operated under the able General
Managership of Frank Mason, former chief of the Paris Bureau.

Collection and preparation of its news reports is in the hands of a
highly trained staff of editors and correspondents. This staff is
directed by Barry Faris, General News Manager, who has had more than a
dozen years' experience in press association work and knows thoroughly
every detail of the service.

George R. Holmes heads a large staff at Washington. Holmes, himself, is
an outstanding authority on news from the National capital, a keen
observer, a vivid writer. William K. Hutchinson, Kenneth Clark, George
Durno, Lawrence Sullivan and William S. Neal are members of the
Washington corps whose achievements have made them widely known to
newspaper editors and readers throughout the United States.

Copeland C. Burg, in Chicago, Ellis H. Martin in San Francisco and other
staff men in all the leading cities in the United States get the news
for International News Service and write it in individualistic style for
New York Evening Journal readers.

The International News Service Foreign Staff is a large one. Harry K.
Reynolds, Director of Foreign Service, with headquarters in New York,
was formerly Manager of the London bureau, and he knows intimately every
phase of the foreign service. Harry R. Flory, Manager in London;
Frederic K. Abbott, Manager in Paris, and Otto D. Tolischus, Manager in
Berlin, not only have done noteworthy work in covering the big news
stories themselves, but direct a network of correspondents in their
respective territories that literally covers the world for International
News Service. Edward L. Deuss in Moscow, Guglielmo Emanuel in Rome and
Harold Ballou in Madrid are capable members of the foreign staff who
know their fields thoroughly. Correspondents are maintained as well in
China, Japan, the Philippines, various South American countries and
elsewhere at strategic points for news coverage.

International News Service correspondents at home and abroad have only
one rule to guide them. That is to get the news and get it right.
Generally, as well, they get it FIRST for New York Evening Journal
readers.




BIG NEWS

_TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE!_


The story of three men in the Arctic.

Above them the cold, gray sky, washed by an impenetrable fog.

Around them only crashing icebergs, each second grinding out a new
variety of the age-old Arctic death threat.

One man injured, unable to continue.

Then the story of the dying man who consigned himself to an icy grave
that his mates might save themselves. And the story of the two men who,
faced with this dilemma, left their pal to die, alone with his thoughts.
Leering icebergs grinding out the death march.

This is the story of Dr. Finn Malmgren and Captains Marianno and Zappi.

It first became known to the world when the New York Evening Journal
printed International News Service dispatches via Moscow on Friday, July
13, 1928. The Evening Journal's headlines then read:

     "MALMGREN DESERTED BY MATES;
     NOT DEAD WHEN ABANDONED"

It wasn't until Sunday, July 15, that other New York papers printed the
gripping story the Evening Journal had given New York on Friday, July
13.

The Evening Journal is _always_ ACCURATE--and FIRST

[Illustration: MARY T. DOUGHERTY

_Editor of Women's News_]

Few women have attained pre-eminence in Journalism. Mary T. Dougherty is
outstanding among the few. Her life's work is dedicated to promoting
greater happiness, greater opportunity and greater influence for women.
She knows America's great women, leaders in social, educational, civic
and political spheres. She devotes all her knowledge, experience and
ability to keeping the Evening Journal overwhelmingly FIRST as a home
newspaper.


[Illustration: JAMES O'CONNOR, EDITOR

_Harlem and Bronx Section_]

Thorough newspaper man who has grown up with the Bronx and uptown New
York. Writes editorials on local topics. Conducts "'ROUND UPTOWN"
column. Edits a real neighborhood section.

Every day over 122,000 copies of the Evening Journal sold above 110th
Street in Harlem, Bronx, Washington Heights and Westchester County
include this section.


[Illustration: RICHARDSON WEBSTER, EDITOR

_Brooklyn and Long Island Section_]

A "Dyed-in-the-Wool" Brooklynite from cradle to editorial chair.
Associated with Brooklyn newspapers for many years. Prominent in
Brooklyn's civic, social and commercial life. Edits a section of real
local news for Kings, Queens and Nassau Counties.

Every day over 234,000 copies of the Evening Journal include this
section, which is thoroughly read in Long Island homes.


[Illustration: DR. FRANK CRANE, PHILOSOPHER]

He knows the problems of the human race. Simplicity of thought and
staunch adherence to an uncompromising philosophy of optimism
distinguish the work of Dr. Frank Crane. His writings are helpful,
encouraging, inspirational. His followers are legion. Thousands of
Evening Journal readers in New York City and suburbs look forward to his
daily articles. His wisdom marks the paths for a happy life.


[Illustration: "BILLY BENEDICK," SOCIETY EDITOR]

"Billy Benedick" ... who is he? He is a member of the most exclusive and
highly placed society set of New York. His newsy quips and chatter about
the doings of socially prominent men and women have established one of
the most extensively read Society News Pages in New York. "Billy
Benedick's" identity is kept secret as his work would obviously be
handicapped were it to be made public.


[Illustration: ELSIE ROBINSON, AUTHOR

"_Listen World!_"]

Elsie Robinson is, like Dr. Crane, a philosopher ... but one would
hardly call her gentle. She is brisk, though never brusque in setting
forth her views. She likes to jog people out of mental ruts and, judging
by her tremendous popularity among the countless thousands of Evening
Journal readers throughout New York City and its suburbs, they like to
have her do it. Her advice is sound and well taken.


[Illustration: HELEN ROWLAND, AUTHOR

"_Meditations of a Wife_"]

Often referred to as America's "Bernard Shaw," and as America's wittiest
woman. Satire sparkles through her writings. Her observations on the
foibles of men and women, the joys and sorrows of love and marriage, and
the relief or the lack of it in divorce are always brilliant and
entertaining, yet always "said with a smile." Helen, like George Cohan,
says: "I always leave 'em laughing when I say good-bye."


[Illustration: WILLIAM WRIGHT, FINANCIAL COUNSELOR

_Investors' Service Bureau_]

Thorough familiarity with the investment securities market has
established him as an authority. Accuracy and informed judgment
characterize his reports. In close contact with the financial world, he
delves into the resources and development of corporate business. A keen
student of finance, he is qualified to give sound and unbiased advice to
countless thousands of Evening Journal readers annually.

DURING 1927

NEW YORK EVENING JOURNAL

_readers addressed letters to_

"WILLIAM WRIGHT"

_Seeking advice on investment problems_

      An analysis of these 12,000 inquiries disclosed that 63% had
      a total of about $25,000,000 actually on hand for investment
      or already invested in securities.

21% specified definite sums of money available for immediate
investment--_totaling approximately_ $10,000,000.

42% gave lists of securities already held, the market value
conservatively estimated at $15,000,000.

More than 1,000 New York Evening Journal readers continue to write in
every month for help in solving their problems. "William Wright" is
giving these readers his helpful and expert advice every day, from his
vast store of financial knowledge.

John Anderson writes entertainingly and authoritatively on the drama. He
tells what a play is about and then gives his own reactions. He does not
belong to the "let-us-pat-each-other-on-the-back" school of critics, but
devotes his column daily to interesting discussions of what is actually
happening in the world of the theatre. Mr. Anderson was formerly on the
Evening Post and is recognized as the highest type of drama writer in
New York.


[Illustration: ROSE PELSWICK, MOTION PICTURE EDITOR]

Unquestionably the greatest cartoonist of the age. His pen combines the
master strokes of the artist and a broad knowledge of politics and
public affairs. He gives Evening Journal readers the "high lights" of
the news of the day and portrays unerringly the virtue or villainy of
public characters. Powers' outstanding talent has helped to make the
Journal the most interesting evening newspaper in America.


[Illustration: GARRETT P. SERVISS, ASTRONOMER]

He writes the story of the stars and tells it fascinatingly every day in
the Evening Journal. His mail exceeds that of any other contributor. He

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
