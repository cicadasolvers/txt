SQUARE PEGS


CHARACTERS.

    HILDA          A MODERN GIRL.

    GIOCONDA       A FIFTEENTH CENTURY VENETIAN.


SCENE.

_A Garden. Entrance right and left. Left, a table and two chairs. (The
general effect should suggest a little lawn which leads outward in
several directions.)_

_The arrival of a taxicab is heard, off. Enter left_, HILDA _in
summer hat and dress and with a light cloak on her arm. She carries a
folding-map and a small book._

HILDA (_speaking off, left_).

    What's that? As certain as your name's Joe Billings
    The taximeter points at fifteen shillings.
    Well, and you've had a pound. What? Made a slip?
    _I_ thought five shillings was a handsome tip.
    You want my father's home-address? 'The Haven,
    Chad Crescent, Baystead, North-West 57.'
    He'll write you out a cheque--I'm sure he will.

                               [_Sound of a motor-horn growing fainter._

    The creature's gone. These taxi-men! But still--
    At last I've found the Enchanted Garden... Wait:
    Suppose that isn't really Merlin's Gate,
    Nor this the garden where a girl who loathes
    Our Twentieth Century (all except its clothes)
    May turn the Book of Time to any page
    And find herself back in a lovelier age?
    The map will show. Yes, there's the gate, and there's
    That wall, that table, these two empty chairs...
    Everything's right. How wonderful, how splendid,
    To know that here the roar of time has ended!
    Now, let me see...                            [_Consulting her map._

                       If I should take that road
    What century should I have for my abode?
    'To Ancient Rome.' Lovely!

                             [_She starts to go out, right. Then stops._

                               It might be serious,
    Though, if I chanced on Nero or Tiberius.
    The Romans had no manners... This way here--
    So the map says--would lead me to the year
    Ten-sixty-six. I won't be such a fool
    As go back where I stuck so long at school.
    William the First was always dull. I know
    He'd make me listen to him--standing so,
    With Bayeux hands, knee crooked, and neck bowed--
    While he read all the Domesday Book aloud.
    I shan't go there... Now, that's a pretty view!

                                                [_Referring to the map._

    'The Eighteenth Century: Boswell Avenue.'
    I might try that. But no--that won't do either.
    I'd have to wear a wig or tell them why there,
    Love coffee-houses more than trees and birds
    And talk in such tremendously long words.
    I know, I know! If I can find the way
    I'll wander back into the sumptuous day
    When, in his gardens near the warm lagoon,
    Titian gave feasts under the stars and moon.
    That would be heavenly! Those were noble times.
    There was a grandeur even about the crimes
    Of people like the Borgias ... and their dresses,
    And the sweet way they wore their hair in tresses,
    And--oh, and everything! What was Titian's date?
    I mustn't err into a time too late;
    But how to make quite sure? I'll take a look
    In this adorable fire-coloured book--
    Addington Symonds... Oh, that I knew more!
    Was it in fifteen-sixty or before?

           [_Settling herself in one of the chairs, she becomes absorbed
               in her book. Enter, right_, GIOCONDA _carrying two or
               three modern novels_.

GIOCONDA (_speaking off, right_).

    I thank you, gondolier. You drowned my nurse
    With true dramatic finish. Take this purse.
    So--I am in that Garden where time speeds
    Backward or forward as our fancy needs.
    How sick I am of cloaks and ambuscades,
    Of poison, daggers, moonlight serenades,
    Of those dull dances that are all _I_ get--
    Pavane, gavotte, forlana, minuet--
    And the long pageant of our life at Venice!
    Now, in the Twentieth Century there is tennis,
    With cream and strawberries round a chestnut-tree,
    And day-long idling in the June-blue sea,
    And soda-fountains, too, and motor-cars,
    And Henley Weeks and Russian Ballet 'stars.'
    Oh, what a wealth of joy that century has!
    To think that I myself may learn to jazz!
    Truly, I judge it has no slightest flaw--
    The glorious age of Bennett, Wells, and Shaw.

                [_She sets her books on the table and curtsies to them._

    Gramercy now--Shaw, Bennett, Wells, and Co.--
    Since you have shown me what I longed to know,
    How to behave, talk, smoke, and bob my hair
    In nineteen-twenty, when at last I'm there.
    Could I but find a guide! How shall I tell
    Which road to follow? If I listen well
    I ought to hear the roaring of their trains,
    Their motor-horns, their humming monoplanes...

                                   [_She listens intently for a moment._

    The very bees are silent...                         [_Seeing_ HILDA.

                                Who is that?
    Surely, unless the books have lied, her hat
    Came from 'Roulette's,' in Portman Square, West One!
    A Twentieth-Century girl! The thing is done--
    I need but ask her which way London lies.

                                             [_Kissing her hand, right._

    Farewell, Rialto! Farewell, Bridge of Sighs!

                   [_She goes up to_ HILDA _and curtsies ceremoniously_.

    Dear Signorina ... Signorina ... Deep
    In Bennett's fragrant works, or can she sleep?
    Could _The Five Towns_ have bored her? Let me try
    Once more. Most noble Signorina...

HILDA (_starting up_).

                                       Why,
    Who are you, lady? By your dress and ways
    I think you must have come from Titian's days.

GIOCONDA.

    Indeed, I do. Old Titian! How he talks!
    He did my portrait last July in chalks.
    But grant me the great liberty, I pray,
    Of asking what your name is...

HILDA.

                                   Hilda Gray.

GIOCONDA.

    How sweet and to the point!

HILDA.

                                And yours?

GIOCONDA.

                                           Gioconda
    Francesca Violante Giulia della Bionda.

HILDA.

    It is a poem in itself! It shines
    Like the soft sheen on Tasso's velvet lines.
    What can have led you to forego an age
    When life was an illuminated page
    From some superb romance?

GIOCONDA.

                              And what, I wonder,
    Can have torn you and your rich time asunder?

HILDA.

    I'll tell you, for I'm sure you'll sympathise.
    I have a lover...

GIOCONDA.

                      That is no surprise.

HILDA.

    And by the post this morning came a letter--

GIOCONDA.

    From him?

HILDA.

              From him.

GIOCONDA.

                        What could have happened better?

HILDA.

    Ah! naturally you think that Harry writes
    Of longing, suicide, and sleepless nights.
    Did he, I'd read his letters ten times over--
    But you don't know the Twentieth Century lover.
    Oh, for a man who'd write through tears, all swimmily,
    And woo me with grand metaphor and simile!
    I couldn't bear the slang that Harry used
    In asking for my hand.

GIOCONDA.

                  So you refused!

HILDA.

    Yes, and came here to seek a braver time.

GIOCONDA.

    How odd! _I_ had a letter, all in rhyme,
    Brought by a lackey to my father's gate
    Just when dawn broke. As if I couldn't wait!
    He dashed up, panting; and his horse's mouth
    Was flecked with blood and foam...

HILDA (_clasping her hands_).

                                      The passionate South!

GIOCONDA.

    The fellow gave the letter, gasped, went red,
    And straightway horse and lackey fell down dead.
    I scanned the note, observed the flowery phrases
    In which the writer smothered me with praises;
    Compared them with the style of Bernard Shaw,
    And told him briskly that he might withdraw.

HILDA.

    If I could see that letter!

GIOCONDA.

                                So you shall,
    Sweet friend--or, rather, right you are, old pal.
    I'll read it.

                [_She produces a letter tied with rose-coloured ribbon._

HILDA.

                  Do!... I see his passion's flood
    Demands red ink.

GIOCONDA.

                     Oh dear, no--that's his blood.
        Now, listen. Did you ever hear a style
        Quite so absurd? I call it simply vile.              [_Reading._
          'Adored Gioconda--glittering star
            Unsullied by the dusty world,
            Rich rose with leaves but half uncurled,
          New Venus in thy dove-drawn car--
          Have pity: drive thy wrath afar.
            Let Cupid's war-flag be upfurled,
            Lest by thy gentle hand be hurled
        The mortal bolt that leaves no scar.

        'So prays upon his aching knee
          Thy humble vassal, once the fear
        Of Christendom, but now--woe's me!--
          One whose wild prayers Love will not hear,
        Who treads the earth and has no home--
        Giulio Pandolfo, Duke of Rome.'

HILDA.

    Gioconda, what a lover!

GIOCONDA.

                            So _I_ think--
    His brain a dictionary, his blood mere ink.

HILDA.

    Oh, but _I_ mean how fine a lover! Would
    That mine could pen a letter half so good!

GIOCONDA.

    How does he write?

HILDA.

                       Write! Would you deign to call
    _That_ 'writing'--this illiterate blotted scrawl?

                                                             [_Reading._

        'Dear Hilda, if you buy _The Star_
          To-night, you mustn't for the world
          Suppose he got my hair uncurled--
        That blighter who kyboshed the car.
        He had the worst of it by far
          Because the hood on mine was furled.
          Good Lord! what steep abuse he hurled!
        Yours, Harry--with a nasty scar.

        'P.S.--The cut's above the knee,
          And won't be right just yet, I fear
        Oh, and what price you marrying me?
          Anything doing? Let me hear.
        Ring up to-morrow, if you're home.
        Where shall we do our bunk? To Rome?'

    Now, wasn't that enough to make me mad?
    It is a shame! It really is too bad!
    'Dear Hilda'--plain 'dear'! And what girl could marry
    A man who, when proposing, ends 'yours, Harry'?

GIOCONDA.

    I love his downright manner. In my mind
    I see him, a tall figure; and, behind,
    His old two-seater. Yes, I see him plainly--
    Close-cropped--

HILDA.

                    Half bald.

GIOCONDA.

                               Slow-moving--

HILDA.

                                             And ungainly.

GIOCONDA.

    A brow like H. G. Wells' my fancy draws,
    An eye like Bennett's and a beard like Shaw's.
    I know your Harry--just the English type,
    A silent strong man married to his pipe,
    With so few words, except about machines,
    That he can never tell you what he means:
    But were _I_ his, and we two went a-walking,
    What should that matter? _I_ could do the talking.

HILDA.

    Surely you see, Gioconda, I require
    A lover who can make love with some fire.

GIOCONDA.

    And I a lover so much overcome
    By deep emotion that it leaves him dumb.

HILDA.

    No poetry? Then, so far as I can tell,
    The Twentieth Century ought to suit you well...
    I've an idea!

GIOCONDA.

                  What is it?

HILDA.

                              This: that you
    Show me how best you'd like a man to woo.

GIOCONDA.

    I will, I will!

HILDA.

                    Imagine, then, that I
    Am she for whom you say you'd gladly die.
    This is my room at Baystead: that's the street:
    You must come in from there--                  [_Leading her, left._
                                  and then we meet.

GIOCONDA.

    By Holy Church, a pretty sport to play!
    God shield you, Signorina Hilda Grey!                  [_Exit left._

HILDA.

    Now--what's the time? It must be half-past four.
    It is. I'll give him just one minute more.

          [_Looking at herself in a pocket-mirror, and making a toilet._

    Goodness! I do look horrid... Will he bring
    An emerald or a pearl engagement-ring?
    He comes! I'll take pearls as a last resort.

_Enter, left_, GIOCONDA (_carrying a pipe and a walking-stick_).

GIOCONDA.

    Well, and how _are_ you? In the pink, old sport?

HILDA.

    I'm glad to see you, Harry. Do sit down.

GIOCONDA.

    'Some' heat to-day, what? Even here. In town
    Perfectly awful. Got a match?

           [_She tries in vain to light the pipe from a match struck by_
               HILDA.

                                  I say,
    Old thing--you really look top-hole to-day.

HILDA.

    Well, naturally: I knew that you were coming.

           [GIOCONDA _pulls at her pipe in silence, pokes the floor with
               her stick, and shifts it from hand to hand._

    You're very quiet.

GIOCONDA (_with a start_).

                       Oh! what's that you're thumbing?

                    [_Goes over to_ HILDA _and looks over her shoulder._

HILDA.

    Addington Symonds.

GIOCONDA.

                       Any good?

HILDA.

                                 Why--gorgeous!
    You ought to read it--all about the Borgias.

GIOCONDA.

    What are they? Oh, I see! I had enough
    Up at the 'Varsity of that sort of stuff.
    I say--oh, blast the thing, this pipe's a dud!

                                      [_She puts the pipe on the table._

HILDA.

    You smoke too much. They say it slows the blood,
    And _that_ you simply can't afford.                        [_Pause._

GIOCONDA.

                                        I say--

HILDA.

    Well, what?

GIOCONDA.

                You really look top-hole to-day.

HILDA.

    How nice! But flattery always was your wont.               [_Pause._

GIOCONDA.

    I say--

HILDA.

            That's just it, Harry dear--you don't.

GIOCONDA.

    I came to ask you something...                  [_Producing a ring._
                                   Ever seen
    A ring like this? Not a bad sort of green.

HILDA (_taking it_).

    Emeralds! I worship emeralds. They enthrone
    All the luxuriant summer in a stone.
    Do let me just see how it looks! The third
    Finger, I think, is generally preferred?
    How splendid! Won't she be delighted?

GIOCONDA.

                                          Who?

HILDA.

    Your dear Aunt Kate.

GIOCONDA.

                         I bought the thing for you.

HILDA.

    Harry!

GIOCONDA.

           _You_ know--a what-d'you-call-it ring.

HILDA.

    Engagement?

GIOCONDA.

                That's the goods. And in the Spring
    The parson gets our guinea. What about it?

HILDA.

    See, how it fits! I couldn't do without it.

GIOCONDA.

    Right-o! Then, that's that: good. But if you carry
    A diary, jot down, 'Next Spring, marry Harry'--
    You might forget. You've got a diary?

HILDA (_bringing a small diary from her bag_).

                                          Look--
    I did blush--buying an engagement-book!

GIOCONDA.

    Well, how's the enemy? Good Lord! what a shock!
    D'you know, old bean, it's more than five o'clock?

HILDA.

    You'll have some tea?

GIOCONDA.

                          Can't. Sorry. Told two men
    I'd play a foursome with them at 5.10.
    You'd better make the fourth.

HILDA.

                                  I really can't.
    I've got some new delphiniums I _must_ plant.

GIOCONDA (_going out, left_).

    See you to-morrow, then.

HILDA.

                             You'll drive me frantic
    If you're not just the teeniest bit romantic!

GIOCONDA.

    It isn't done. You're absolutely wrong
    In asking me to do that stunt. So long!

                             [_She tosses the pipe and stick off, left._

    There! Did I play it well? You'd be my wife?

HILDA (_sighing_).

    My dear, you played old Harry to the life--
    His gaucherie...

GIOCONDA.

                     His noble self-command...

HILDA.

    The way he shifts his cane from hand to hand...

GIOCONDA.

    A nervous trick that shows how much he feels...

HILDA.

    All I know is--I'd have a man who kneels
    And pours out passion in a style as rippling
    As the best Swinburne--or at least as Kipling.

GIOCONDA.

    Then I'll now be _your_ lady. To your part--
    Woo me as you'd be wooed!

HILDA.

                              With all my heart!

              [_Catching up her cloak, she flings it over her shoulder._

    Last Miracle of the World, sainted, adored,
    Divine Gioconda--hear me, I beg!

GIOCONDA.

                                     My lord!

HILDA.

    Dost know of passion? Is that heart so pure
    As not to guess what torments I endure
    Who for so long have sighed for thee in vain?
    And wilt thou have no pity on my pain?
    Wilt thou still spurn me as a thing abhorred
    Whose only crime is to love thee?

GIOCONDA.

                                      My lord--

HILDA.

    Stay! I will brook no answer. For thy sake
    Did I not paint the town in crimson-lake?
    Have I not wrenched thee through thy nunnery-bars?
    And bear I not some ninety-seven scars
    Taken as I fought my way to thy fair feet?
    Think how thy relatives rushed into the street
    To save thee--how I put them to the sword
    And left them strewn about in heaps!

GIOCONDA.

                                         My lord--

HILDA.

    Had I a boy's light love when I, to win
    Thy favour, cut off all thy kith and kin?
    Run through the list! Measure my love by that!
    Two great-grandfathers (one, I own, was fat);
    Five brothers; fourteen uncles; half a score
    Of nephews (and I dare say even more);
    A brace of maiden-aunts; a second-cousin;
    And family connections by the dozen.
    Does it not melt that pitiless heart of ice
    To see thyself secured at such a price?

GIOCONDA.

    My lord--

HILDA.

              Or if indeed thy heart requires
    Flame fiercer than my love's Etnaean fires--
    Ask what thou wilt, but do not ask that I
    Live on. Command me, rather, how to die.
    Say in what style thou'dst have me perish here,
    So that at least my ardour win one tear!
    Choose what thou wilt--I'll execute thy charge--
    Nor fear to speak: my repertoire is large.
    I can suspend myself upon a rafter;
    Fall on my blade, and die with horrid laughter;
    Leap from a height; read Bennett's books; or swallow
    Poison--and, mark you, with no sweet to follow.

GIOCONDA.

    My lord--

HILDA.

              Thy choice is made?

GIOCONDA.

                                  My lord--

HILDA.

                                            Alack!

GIOCONDA.

    I have accepted thee ten minutes back.

HILDA.

    Then--I will deign to live. My castle stands
    Four-towered among its olive-silvered lands.
    Away! Away! Thou art all heaven to me!

                            [_She drags_ GIOCONDA _right_. _They break._

GIOCONDA.

    Wonderful! That's Pandolfo to a tee!

HILDA.

    I should adore him!

GIOCONDA.

                        And I Harry, too...
    If only you were I and I were you!
    But soft! since here we stand beyond the range
    Of Time, why don't we swop?

HILDA.

                                You mean 'exchange'?
    Why not? We will!                          [_Moving quickly, right._
                      May Titian's age enfold me!

GIOCONDA.

    Stop! Stop! You can't go yet. You haven't told me
    Where I can find the Twentieth Century.

HILDA (_leading her front, and pointing to the audience_).

                                            Then,
    Behold its ladies and its gentlemen.

GIOCONDA.

    What lovely people!... All the same, you know,
    They're not as I have pictured them.

HILDA.

                                         How so?

GIOCONDA.

    They're all so still... And then--my fancy boggles
    To see not one who's wearing motor-goggles!
    How can I get among them?

HILDA.

                              You must jump
    Down there.

GIOCONDA.

                But that would mean a dreadful bump!

HILDA.

    You want to go from fifteen-sixty sheer
    To nineteen-twenty. 'Tis a jump, my dear...
    And so--farewell! I come, I come at last--
    O fire and sound and perfumes of the Past!

                                         [_She goes out quickly, right._

GIOCONDA.

    Her eyes were green. However hard he tries,
    Pandolfo never can resist green eyes.
    I know he'll die for her and not for me.
    Why did I let her go? It shall not be!

                                                 [HILDA _enters, right._

HILDA.

    It shall not be! Why did I let her go?
    Harry will love her more than me, I know.
    Gioconda!

GIOCONDA.

              Hilda!

HILDA.

                     Somehow, after all,
    I can't let Harry go beyond recall.
    I think of his good heart: I know how proud
    I'll be to watch him through a dusty cloud
    When his new car, balanced upon one tire,
    Rolls roistering through the lanes of Devonshire.

GIOCONDA.

    I too, fair friend, perceive with sudden terror
    The greatness of my momentary error.
    I mustn't let you risk the enterprise...
    Pandolfo never could endure green eyes!

HILDA.

    Let us each make the best of her own age!

GIOCONDA.

    But sometimes you will write me--just a page?

HILDA.

    I will indeed. And you?

GIOCONDA.

                            And so will I.
    Hilda--farewell!

HILDA.

    Gioconda, dear--good-bye!

        [_Standing in the middle of the stage, they take hands and kiss.
            Then they come to the front, left and right._

    So ends our fantasy--the slight design
      Arisen and gone like sound in summer trees,

GIOCONDA.

      The burden such as every mind may seize--
    That in all centuries life is goodly wine!

HILDA.

    Which has the more of joy, her age or mine,
      We leave you to determine as you please.

GIOCONDA.

      Mine has the painting-schools--the Sienese,
    Venetian and unchallenged Florentine.

HILDA.

    Mine has the knowledge that our mortal pains
      Are fleeing from the skilled physician's arts.

GIOCONDA.

    Mine the delight of unspoiled hills and plains,
      Fair speech, adventure, and romantic hearts.

HILDA.

    And mine a sense that, by the single sun
    That all men share, the world for man is one.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
