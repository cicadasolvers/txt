    _A BUNCH_ of Christmas Roses, dear,
      To greet my fairest child,
    I plucked them in my garden where
      The drifting snow lay piled.

    I cannot bring thee violets dear,
      Or cowslips growing wild,
    Or daisy chain for thee to wear,
      For thee to wear, my child.

    For all the grassy meadows near
      Are clad with snow, my child;
    Through all the days of winter drear
      No ray of sun has smiled.

    I plucked this bunch of verses, dear,
      From out my garden wild,
    I plucked them in the winter drear
      For you, my fairest child,
    Your wet and wintry hours to cheer,
      They're Christmas Roses, child.

    _THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING._

    "_I DON'T_ believe that Santa Claus will come to you and me,"
    Said little crippled Nell, "a'cause, we are so poor you see;
    And then I don't believe the 'chimbley's' wide enough for him,
    D'ye think that Santa Claus will come, when all the lights are dim."
    "Of course he comes to every one, dear, whether rich or poor;
    Now go to bed dear Nell," said Nan, "he'll come to-night I'm sure."

           *       *       *       *       *

    I don't know if by chimney or if by stair he crept,
    But sure enough he visited the room where Nelly slept.
    He brought a golden orange, and a monkey red and blue,
    That climbed a little wooden stick in a way I couldn't do.
    He hung them in Nell's stocking, and Nan was right, be sure,
    That Santa Claus loves every one however rich or poor.

    _THE PET RABBIT._

    "_I HAVE_ a little Bunny with a coat as soft as down,
    And nearly all of him is white except one bit of brown.
    The first thing in the morning when I get out of bed,
    I wonder if my Bunny's still safe in his little shed.

    And than the next thing that I do I dare say you have guessed;
    It's to go at once and see him, when I am washed and dressed.
    And every day I see him I like him more and more,
    And each day he is bigger than he was the day before.

    I feed him in the morning with bran and bits of bread,
    And every night I take some straw to make his little bed.
    What with carrots in the morning and turnip-tops for tea,
    If a bunny can be happy, I'm sure he ought to be.

    Then when it's nearly bedtime I go down to his shed,
    And say 'Good night you Bunny' before I go to bed.
    I think there's only one thing that would make me happy quite,
    If I could take my Bunny dear with me to bed at night?"

    FATHER'S BOAT.

    _IT'S_ Father's boat we're watching,
          Away out on the sea,
    She's named the Pretty Polly,
          One hundred and ninety three,
    Father called her the Polly,
          After Mother and me.

    There isn't a smarter boat
          Than Father's on the sea,
    The Pretty Polly is _our_ ship,
          Father's the skipper is he,
    And we are watching for Father,
          We're watching, Nancy and me.

    Sometimes the wind blows wildly,
          But Nancy, and Mother, and me,
    We sing a bit of a hymn we know,
          The hymn for those at sea,
    Although when we think of Father,
          We're as near to choke as can be.

    To-night the moon will be shining,
          A sight it will be to see,
    Father's ship all in silver,
          A'sail on a silver sea,
    And Father himself a coming home
          To Mother and Nancy and me.

    [Illustration: FATHER'S BOAT.]




    [Illustration]

    _A MISTAKE._

    "_MY_ dears, whatever are you at?
      You ought to be at home;
    I told you not to wet your feet--
      I told you not to roam.

    "Oh, dear! I'm sure you will be drowned!
      _I_ never saw such tricks
    Come home at once, and go to bed,
      You naughty naughty chicks."

    Now most of them were five days old,
      But one, whose age was six--
    "Please, ma'am," said he, "I think we're ducks;
      I don't believe we're chicks!"

    [Illustration: LITTLE DUCKS.]




    [Illustration]

    _A SAD TALE._

    "_Who's_ afraid of a cat?" said he;
      "I'm not afraid of a cat."
        He was a bird who sat on a rail,
      With five other birds, and this was his tale.
        "I'm not afraid of a cat."

    "I _might_ be afraid if I were a mouse,
      Or even if I were a rat:
        But as I'm a bird
        I give you my word
      I'm not afraid of a cat."

    A cat and her kits came down on the scene,
      Five birds flew over the rail;
        Our hero was caught
        As quick as a thought,
      And didn't he alter his tale!

    "You've made a mistake, Mister Cat," said he;
      "You must please let me go, Mister Cat.
        I'm not at all nice,
        I don't taste like mice:
      You'd much better have a young rat."
        Said the cat, "It's no use,
        You may be a goose,
      I'll not let you go for all that."




    _THE CREW OF THE NANCY LEE._

    [Illustration]

    _Polly's_ the mate of the Nancy Lee,
      And Tom is the skipper bold,
        They sail together
        In rough wind and weather,
      And they are the crew, all told.

      In their taut and trim little boat they ride
    Away o'er the bright blue sea,
        With hands ever ready,
        And hearts ever steady,
    Whatever the dangers may be.
    And a smarter crew will never be found,
    Though you may search the whole world round.




    [Illustration: HIE FOR CHRISTMAS.]

    _HIE FOR CHRISTMAS!_

    _Bring_ Frost, bring Snow,
          Come winter,
          Bring us holly,
    Bring joy at Christmas,
          Off with Melancholy!

    Sing hie, sing hey,
          Sing ho,
          Sing holly,
    Sing hie for Christmas!
          Isn't winter jolly?

    Sing Jack, Sing Jill,
          Sing Jo,
          Sing Polly,
    Sing hie for Christmas,
          Mistletoe and Holly.




    [Illustration: PUTTING AWAY THE TOYS.]

    [Illustration]

    _BEDTIME._

    "_It's_ bedtime, bedtime, Cissy dear,
      It's time to put away,
    Your little Noah's ark dear
      Until another day,
    You know it isn't right at all
      To tire yourself with play.

    And they too must be tired dear,
      The elephants want to go
    To bed,--if they're much later,
      They'll all be ill I know,
    And every well bred camel,
      Is in bed long ago.

    And surely you can see dear,
      It really isn't right,
    The little dove's so tired dear,
      She scarce can stand upright.
    It does not do to keep them up
      So very late at night."




    [Illustration]

    _PUSS IN THE CORNER._

    "_You_ are a naughty pussy-cat,
    I think it right to mention that,
    To all who see your picture here,
    'Twas you who broke my Bunny dear.

    An hour ago, as you can tell,
    I left him here, alive and well;
    And now he's _dead_ and, what is more,
    You've broke his leg I'm pretty sure.

    For you my puss I'll never care,
    No never, never, never, _there_,
    And you are in disgrace you know,
    And in the corner you must go.

    What crying? Then I must cry too
    And I can't bear to punish you;
    Perhaps my Bunny isn't dead,
    Perhaps you've only stunned his head.

    And though I'm sure you broke his leg,
    It may be mended with a peg,
    And though he's very, very, funny,
    My Bunny's not a real Bunny,
    And I'll forgive and tell you that,
    You're my own precious pussy cat."

    [Illustration: PUSS IN THE CORNER.]




    [Illustration]

    _THE LITTLE HE AND SHE._

    _Once_ there lived, I'm not sure where,
      May be Arcadee,
    Sweet-Heart and his mistress fair,
      Little He and She;

    And they danced a measure light,
      Danced in very glee.
    Hand in hand, a pretty sight,
      Little He and She.

    When they ceased his bright eyes fell,
      Darling must we stay?
    Can't we dance so happily
      You and I for aye?

    Then she clasped his hand again,
      Whispered sweet and low,
    "Dearest, always hand in hand
      You and I will go."

    So they danced with merry feet,
      E'en in Arcadee,
    Happier pair you ne'er will meet,
      Little He and She.




    [Illustration]

    _LITTLE BO-PEEP._

    _Little_ Bo-peep has lost her Sheep,
    (It's a secret to you I'm confiding.)
    At the end of the shelf,
    Where she put them herself,
    Her Baa-lambs are safely hiding.

    If you put a thing carefully, safely away,
    You're sure not to find it when wanted next day.




    [Illustration: HOPES AND FEARS.]

    [Illustration]

    _HOPES AND FEARS._

    _Like_ clouds that flit across the sky,
      So follow hopes and fears.
    What in these clouds see you and me
      Dear Sweetheart, smiles or tears?

    This little airy fleecy wing,
      That flits across the blue,
    What message Sweetheart does it bring
      Of hope or fear to you?

    Pray God it brings you _sunny hours_
      And haply some few _tears_
    To bless like showers your summer flowers
      In the long coming years.




    [Illustration]

    _THE STORY BOOK FAIRY._

      _Shall_ I sing you a song, not short and not long,
      Of a story-book fairy who hides all among
      The covers and leaves of your pictures and prints,
      And colors them all with such beautiful tints?

    First he kisses the girls with the fairest of curls
    Then they blush like red roses and each head whirls.
    In each little eye drops a bit of blue sky,
    And colors each frock with a wonderful dye.

      His breathing I ween is the wonderful sheen,
      That clothes trees and meadows with loveliest green,
      The buttercups bold, it need hardly be told,
      Are gilded by him with the finest of gold.

      It is he I suppose who paints the red rose,
      And the rest of the flowers which every one knows,
      And the same red will do (or a similar hue),
      For Robin and little Red Riding Hood too.

      He's awake it is said when you are abed,
      For the picture-book doggies and cats must be fed,
      To the picture-book children some stories he'll tell,
      And sometimes he'll read them their verses as well.

      The moment you open your picture book he
      Is away out of sight as quick as can be,
      For fairy law says that a fairy must die
      The instant he's seen by one human eye.




    _SPRING._

    _The_ tiny crocus is so bold
        It peeps its head above the mould,
        Before the flowers awaken,
    To say that spring is coming, dear,
    With sunshine and that winter drear
        Will soon be overtaken.

    [Illustration]




    [Illustration]

    _GOLDEN DAYS._

    _There_ are days of summer sunshine,
      Of warm and sunny weather,
    When the hedge is full of hawthorn
      And hills are glad with heather.

    There are days of silent sadness,
      Of frost, and snow, and rain,
    When we fear that summer's gladness
      Will never come again.

    And now our songs are minor key,
      And now in merry tune;
    The windward side will change to lee,
      And January to June.

    Day and night the sun is shining,
      Though he may hide his head;
    Each cloud has a silver lining,
      The flowers are asleep not dead.

    Every day may have its playtime
      Made bright by cheerful lays;
    And life be one long Maytime,
      A year of golden days.

    [Illustration: GOLDEN DAYS.]




    [Illustration]

    _A SLANDER._

    "_Shake_ hands, shake hands my little girl,"
      Said Mister Crab to Nell,
    "I'm very glad to meet you dear,
      I hope you are quite well.
    I think it's very hot to-day,
      I feel it in my shell."

    "I can't shake hands with you," said Nell,
      "It isn't thought polite,
    Without an introduction;
      Besides, no doubt it's spite,
    It mayn't be true, but still they do,
      They do say that you--BITE."




    [Illustration]

    _A SONG._

    I _hear_ a Song
      I think 'tis a thrush's.
    He sings to the Wild Rose
      See how she blushes!

    [Illustration]




    [Illustration: THE EVENING HOUR.]

    [Illustration]

    _NEARLY BEDTIME._

    _Only_ half an hour or so
      Before nurse calls them to bed,
    And the ruddy light of a cheerful fire
      Shines over each curly head.

    No trouble have they, no sorrow--
      Their hearts are lighter than air,
    No fear that a dark to-morrow
      May bring with it want or care.

    God send them each on their pathway
      Many a wayside flower;
    And grant, in the evening of lifetime,
      The joy of the evening hour.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
