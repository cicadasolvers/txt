OVERVIEW [EN]


The first ebook was available on July 4, 1971, as eText #1 of Project
Gutenberg, a visionary project launched by Michael Hart to create free
electronic versions of literary works and disseminate them worldwide.
In the 16th century, Gutenberg allowed anyone to have print books for a
small cost. In the 21st century, Project Gutenberg would allow anyone
to have a digital library at no cost. Project Gutenberg got its first
boost with the invention of the web in 1990, and its second boost with
the creation of Distributed Proofreaders in 2000, to share the
proofreading of ebooks between hundreds of volunteers. In 2010, Project
Gutenberg offered more than 33,000 high-quality ebooks being downloaded
by the tens of thousands every day, and websites in the United States,
in Australia, in Europe, and in Canada, with 40 mirror sites worldwide.

This trilingual (English, Spanish, French) ebook is meant to celebrate
the 40th anniversary of Project Gutenberg, with four parts:
# Project Gutenberg is 40 years old
# From the past to the future
# Project Gutenberg and languages
# Distributed Proofreaders is 10 years old

About the author > Marie Lebert is a researcher and journalist

PROJECT GUTENBERG IS 40 YEARS OLD [EN]


In the 16th century, Gutenberg allowed anyone to have print books for a
small cost. In the 21st century, Project Gutenberg would allow anyone
to have a digital library at no cost.

# Beginning

As recalled by Michael Hart in January 2009 in an email interview: "On
July 4, 1971, while still a freshman at the University of Illinois
(UI), I decided to spend the night at the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at
the UI Materials Research Lab, rather than walk miles home in the
summer heat, only to come back hours later to start another day of
school. I stopped on the way to do a little grocery shopping to get
through the night, and day, and along with the groceries they put in
the faux parchment copy of The U.S. Declaration of Independence that
became quite literally the cornerstone of Project Gutenberg. That
night, as it turned out, I received my first computer account - I had
been hitchhiking on my brother's best friend's name, who ran the
computer on the night shift. When I got a first look at the huge amount
of computer money I was given, I decided I had to do something
extremely worthwhile to do justice to what I had been given. This was
such a serious, and intense thought process for a college freshman, my
first thought was that I had better eat something to get up enough
energy to think of something worthwhile enough to repay the cost of all
that computer time. As I emptied out groceries, the faux parchment
Declaration of Independence fell out, and the light literally went on
over my head like in the cartoons and comics... I knew what the future
of computing, and the internet, was going to be... 'The Information
Age.' The rest, as they say, is history."

Michael keyed in The United States Declaration of Independence to the
mainframe he was using, in upper case, because there was no lower case
yet. The file was 5 K. To send a 5 K file to the 100 users of the pre-
internet of the time would have crashed the network, so Michael
mentioned where the etext was stored - though without a hypertext link,
because the web was still 20 years ahead. It was downloaded by six
users. Project Gutenberg was born.

Michael decided to use the huge amount of computer time he had been
given to search the literary works that were stored in libraries, and
to digitize these works. A book would become a continuous text file
instead of a set of pages. Project Gutenberg's mission would be the
following: to put at everyone's disposal, in electronic versions, as
many literary works as possible for free.

After keying in The United States Declaration of Independence (signed
on July 4, 1776) in 1971, Michael typed in a longer text, The United
States Bill of Rights, in 1972, i.e. the first ten amendments added in
1789 to the Constitution (dated 1787) and defining the individual
rights of the citizens and the distinct powers of the federal
government and the States. A volunteer typed in The United States
Constitution in 1973.

From one year to the next, disk space was getting larger, by the
standards of the time - there was no hard disk yet -, making it
possible to store larger files.

Volunteers began typing in The Bible, with one individual book at a
time, and a file for each book.

Michael typed in the collected works of Shakespeare, with volunteers,
one play at a time, and a file for each play. This edition of
Shakespeare was never released, unfortunately, due to changes in
copyright law. Shakespeare's works belong to public domain, but
comments and notes may be copyrighted, depending on the publication
date. Other editions of Shakespeare from public domain were released a
few years later.

# 10 to 1,000 ebooks

Its critics long considered Project Gutenberg as impossible on a large
scale. But Michael went on keying book after book during many years,
with the help of some volunteers.

In August 1989, Project Gutenberg completed its 10th ebook, The King
James Bible (1769), both testaments, and 5M for all files.

In 1990, there were 250,000 internet users. The web was in its infancy.
The standard was 360 K disks.

In January 1991, Michael typed in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
(1865), by Lewis Carroll. In July 1991, he typed in Peter Pan (1904),
by James M. Barrie. These two classics of childhood literature each fit
on one disk.

The first browser, Mosaic, was released in November 1993. It became
easier to circulate etexts and recruit volunteers. From 1991 to 1996,
the number of ebooks doubled every year, with one ebook per month in
1991, two ebooks per month in 1992, four ebooks per month in 1993, and
eight ebooks per month in 1994.

In January 1994, Project Gutenberg released The Complete Works of
William Shakespeare as eBook #100. Shakespeare wrote most of his works
between 1590 and 1613.

The steady growth went on, with an average of 8 ebooks per month in
1994, 16 ebooks per month in 1995, and 32 ebooks per month in 1996.

In June 1997, Project Gutenberg released The Merry Adventures of Robin
Hood (1883), by Howard Pyle.

Project Gutenberg reached 1,000 ebooks in August 1997. EBook #1000 was
La Divina Commedia (1321), by Dante Alighieri, in Italian, its original
language.

With the number of ebooks on the rise, three main sections were set up:
(a) "Light Literature", such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
Through the Looking-Glass, Peter Pan and Aesop's Fables; (b) "Heavy
Literature", such as the Bible, Shakespeare's works, Moby Dick and
Paradise Lost; (c) "Reference Literature", such as Roget's Thesaurus,
almanacs, and a set of encyclopedias and dictionaries. (A more detailed
classification was created later on.)

"Light Literature" was the main section in number of ebooks. As
explained on the website in 1998: "The Light Literature Collection is
designed to get persons to the computer in the first place, whether the
person may be a pre-schooler or a great-grandparent. We love it when we
hear about kids or grandparents taking each other to an etext of Peter
Pan when they come back from watching Hook at the movies, or when they
read Alice in Wonderland after seeing it on TV. We have also been told
that nearly every Star Trek movie has quoted current Project Gutenberg
etext releases (from Moby Dick in The Wrath of Khan; a Peter Pan quote
finishing up the most recent, etc.) not to mention a reference to
Through the Looking-Glass in JFK. This was a primary concern when we
chose the books for our libraries. We want people to be able to look up
quotations they heard in conversation, movies, music, other books,
easily with a library containing all these quotations in an easy-to-
find etext format."

Project Gutenberg's goal is more about selecting books intended for the
general public than providing authoritative editions. As explained on
the website in 1998: "We do not write for the reader who cares whether
a certain phrase in Shakespeare has a ':' or a ';' between its clauses.
We put our sights on a goal to release etexts that are 99.9% accurate
in the eyes of the general reader. Given the preferences our
proofreaders have, and the general lack of reading ability the public
is currently reported to have, we probably exceed those requirements by
a significant amount. However, for the person who wants an
'authoritative edition' we will have to wait some time until this
becomes more feasible. We do, however, intend to release many editions
of Shakespeare and the other classics for comparative study on a
scholarly level."

The etexts, later called ebooks, were stored in the simplest way, using
the low set of ASCII, called Plain Vanilla ASCII, for them to be read
on any hardware and software. As a text file, a book could be easily
copied, indexed, searched, analyzed, and compared with other books.

As explained by Michael Hart in August 1998 in an email interview: "We
consider etext to be a new medium, with no real relationship to paper,
other than presenting the same material, but I don't see how paper can
possibly compete once people each find their own comfortable way to
etexts, especially in schools. (...) My own personal goal is to put
10,000 etexts on the net [this goal was reached in October 2003] and if
I can get some major support, I would like to expand that to 1,000,000
and to also expand our potential audience for the average etext from
1.x% of the world population to over 10%, thus changing our goal from
giving away 1,000,000,000,000 etexts to 1,000 times as many, a trillion
and a quadrillion in U.S. terminology."

# 1,000 to 10,000 ebooks

From 1998 to 2000, the "output" was an average of 36 new ebooks per
month.

Project Gutenberg reached 2,000 ebooks in May 1999. EBook #2000 was Don
Quijote (1605), by Cervantes, in Spanish, its original language.

Distributed Proofreaders was launched in October 2000 by Charles Franks
to share the proofreading of ebooks between many volunteers. Volunteers
choose one of the digitized books available on the website and
proofread a given page, or several pages, as they wish.

Project Gutenberg reached 3,000 ebooks in December 2000. EBook #3000
was A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (In the Shadow of Young Girls
in Flower), vol. 3 (1919), by Marcel Proust, in French, its original
language.

Project Gutenberg Australia was launched in August 2001.

Project Gutenberg reached 4,000 ebooks in October 2001. EBook #4000 was
The French Immortals Series (1905), in English. This book is an
anthology of short fictions by authors from the French Academy
(Academie Francaise): Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector Malot,
Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet, and others.

The output in 2001 was an average of 104 new ebooks per month.

Project Gutenberg reached 5,000 ebooks in April 2002. EBook #5000 was
The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, an English version of Leonardo's
early 16th-century writings in Italian. Since its release, this ebook
has constantly stayed in the Top 100 of downloaded ebooks.

In 1991, Michael Hart chose to type in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
and Peter Pan because they would each fit on one 360 K disk, the
standard of the time. In 2002, the standard disk was 1.44 M and could
be compressed as a zipped file.

A practical file size is about 3 million characters, more than long
enough for the average book. The ASCII version of a 300-page novel is 1
M. A bulky book can fit in two ASCII files, that can be downloaded as
is or zipped. An average of 50 hours is necessary to get an ebook
selected, copyright-cleared, scanned, proofread, formatted, and
assembled.

A few numbers are reserved for "special" books. For example, eBook
#1984 is reserved for George Orwell's classic, published in 1949, and
still a long way from falling into public domain.

In spring 2002, Project Gutenberg's ebooks represented 25% of all the
public domain works freely available on the web and listed in the
Internet Public Library (IPL). The output in 2002 was an average of 203
new ebooks per month.

In November 2002, Project Gutenberg released the 75 files of the Human
Genome Project, with files of dozens or hundreds of megabytes, shortly
after its initial release in February 2001 as a work from public
domain.

1,000 ebooks in August 1997, 2,000 ebooks in May 1999, 3,000 ebooks in
December 2000, 4,000 ebooks in October 2001, 5,000 ebooks in April
2002, 10,000 ebooks in October 2003. EBook #10000 was The Magna Carta,
signed in 1215 and known as the first English constitutional text.

From April 2002 to October 2003, in 18 months, the collection of ebooks
doubled, going from 5,000 ebooks to 10,000 ebooks, with a monthly
average of 348 new ebooks in 2003. The fast growth was the work of
Distributed Proofreaders, a website launched in October 2000 to share
the proofreading of ebooks between many volunteers.

EBooks were also copied on CDs and DVDs. As blank CDs and DVDs cost
next to nothing, Project Gutenberg began burning and sending a free CD
or DVD to anyone asking for it. People were encouraged to make copies
for a friend, a library or a school. Released in August 2003, the Best
of Gutenberg CD contained 600 ebooks. The first Project Gutenberg DVD
was released in December 2003 to celebrate the first 10,000 ebooks,
with the burning of most titles (9,400 ebooks).

In September 2003, Project Gutenberg launched Project Gutenberg Audio
eBooks, a  collection of human-read ebooks, as well as the Sheet Music
Subproject, a collection of digitized music sheet and music recordings.
A collection of still and moving pictures was also available.

# 10,000 to 20,000 ebooks

In December 2003, there were 11,000 ebooks, which represented 110 G, in
several formats (ASCII, HTML, PDF, and others, as is or zipped). In May
2004, there were 12,600 ebooks, which represented 135 G. With more than
300 new ebooks added per month (338 ebooks per month in 2004), the
number of gigabytes was expected to double every year.

The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) was affiliated with
Project Gutenberg in 2003, and became an official Project Gutenberg
site. Since 1997, PGCC had been working on gathering collections of
existing ebooks, as a complement to Project Gutenberg working on
producing ebooks. As explained by Michael Hart in February 2009: "The
Project Gutenberg Consortia Center has over 75,000 ebooks rendered as
PDF files, and some are really quite stunning. The difference? These
files were prepared by other eLibraries, not Project Gutenberg, and are
using our worldwide distribution network to be seen."

In Europe, Project Rastko, based in Belgrade, Serbia, launched Project
Gutenberg Europe (PG Europe) and Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP
Europe) in January 2004. 100 ebooks were available in June 2005, in
several languages, as a reflection of European linguistic diversity.

In January 2005, Project Gutenberg reached 15,000 ebooks. EBook #15000
was The Life of Reason (1906), by George Santayana.

What about languages? There were ebooks in 25 languages in February
2004, and in 42 languages in July 2005, including Sanskrit and the
Mayan languages. The seven main languages - with more than 50 ebooks -
were English (with 14,548 ebooks on July 27, 2005), French (577
ebooks), German (349 ebooks), Finnish (218 ebooks), Dutch (130 ebooks),
Spanish (103 ebooks), and Chinese (69 ebooks).

In July 2005, Project Gutenberg Australia (launched in August 2001)
reached 500 ebooks.

Project Gutenberg PrePrints was launched in January 2006 to collect
items submitted to Project Gutenberg which were interesting enough to
be available online, but not ready yet to be added to the main Project
Gutenberg collection, because of missing data, low-quality files,
formats which were not handy, etc. 379 ebooks were available in
December 2006, and 2,020 ebooks in February 2009.

In December 2006, Project Gutenberg reached 20,000 ebooks. EBook #20000
was the audiobook of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Vingt mille
lieues sous les mers, 1869), by Jules Verne, in its English version.

If 32 years and 3 months, from July 1971 to October 2003, were
necessary to produce the first 10,000 ebooks, 3 years and 2 months,
from October 2003 to December 2006, were necessary to produce the
following 10,000 ebooks. There were ebooks in 50 languages in December
2006.

# 20,000 to 30,000 ebooks

In December 2006, Mike Cook launched the blog Project Gutenberg News as
"the news portal for gutenberg.org", to complement the existing weekly
and monthly newsletters. For example, the blog gave a table of the
weekly, monthly and yearly production numbers since 2001.

The weekly production was 24 ebooks in 2001, 47 ebooks in 2002, 79
ebooks in 2003, 78 ebooks in 2004, 58 ebooks in 2005, and 80 ebooks in
2006.

The monthly production was 104 ebooks in 2001, 203 ebooks in 2002, 348
ebooks in 2003, 338 ebooks in 2004, 252 ebooks in 2005, and 345 ebooks
in 2006.

The yearly production was 1,244 ebooks in 2001, 2,432 ebooks in 2002,
4,176 ebooks in 2003, 4,058 ebooks in 2004, 3,019 ebooks in 2005, and
4,141 ebooks in 2006.

Project Gutenberg Australia reached 1,500 ebooks in April 2007.

Project Gutenberg Canada (PGC) was launched on July 1st, 2007, on
Canada Day, by Michael Shepard and David Jones. Distributed
Proofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in December 2007. There
were 100 ebooks in March 2008, in English, French, and Italian.

Project Gutenberg sent out 15 million ebooks via CDs and DVDs by snail
mail in 2007. The latest DVD (released in July 2006) included 17,000
ebooks. CD and DVD files were also generated as ISO files (since 2005)
to be downloaded for burning CDs or DVDs.

Project Gutenberg reached 25,000 books in April 2008. EBook #25000 was
English Book Collectors (1902), by William Younger Fletcher.

Project Gutenberg reached 30,000 books in October 2009. EBook #30000
was The Bird Book (1915), by Chester Albert Reed.

# 30,000 ebooks onwards

Distributed Proofreaders celebrated its 10th anniversary in October
2010, with more than 18,000 books digitized and proofread during ten
years by thousands of volunteeers.

Project Gutenberg offered more than 33,000 high-quality proofread
ebooks in December 2010, in various formats for any electronic device
(computer, PDA, mobile phone, smartphone, and ebook reader).



EL PROYECTO GUTENBERG TIENE 40 ANOS [ES]


En el siglo 16, Gutenberg habia hecho posible para todos tener libros
impresos por un precio relativamente modico. En el siglo 21, el
Proyecto Gutenberg iba a permitir a cada uno disponer de una biblioteca
digital gratuita.

# Gestacion

?Cuales son las raices del proyecto? Cuando Michael Hart estudia en la
Universidad de Illinois (Estados Unidos), el laboratorio informatico de
su universidad le asigna millones de dolares de tiempo de ordenador.

El 4 de julio de 1971, dia de la fiesta nacional, Michael digita The
United States Declaration of Independence (Declaracion de independencia
de los Estados Unidos), en mayusculas, pues las letras minusculas aun
no existan. El texto electronico representa 5 K (kilobytes).

El envio de un archivo de 5 K a las cien personas que forman el pre-
internet de la epoca haya acabado con el sistema, provocando su
implosion, porque el ancho de banda aun es infimo.

Michael difunde un mensaje que explica donde se almacena el texto - aun
sin enlace hipertexto, pues habria que esperar unos 20 anos mas para la
web - y seis personas descargan este archivo.

Sobre la marcha, Michael decide dedicar ese enorme credito de tiempo a
la busqueda de obras literarias disponibles en bibliotecas, y a la
digitalizacion de estas.  El conjunto de paginas encuadernadas, forma
tradicional del libro, iba a convertirse en un texto electronico que se
puede desplegar de par en par.

Poco despues, Michael define asi la mision del Proyecto Gutenberg:
poner a disposicion de todos, por via electronica, el mayor numero
posible de obras literarias gratuitamente.

Tras haber digitado The United States Declaration of Independence
(Declaracion de independencia de los Estados Unidos, firmada el 4 de
julio de 1776) en 1971, Michael prosigue con sus esfuerzos en 1972
digitando The United States Bill of Rights  (Declaracion de derechos de
los Estados Unidos). Esa declaracion incluye las diez primeras
enmiendas anadidas en 1789 a la Constitucion de los Estados Unidos
(ratificada en 1787), y define los derechos individuales de los
ciudadanos y los poderes respectivos del gobierno federal y de los
Estados. En 1973, un voluntario digita The United States Constitution
(Constitucion de los
Estados Unidos) en su totalidad.

El internet, aun embrionario en 1971, despega verdaderamente en 1974,
tras la creacion del protocolo TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol /
Internet Protocol).

Ano tras ano, la capacidad del disquete aumenta con regularidad - el
disco duro no existe aun - de modo que los archivos pueden ocupar cada
vez mas espacio. Algunos voluntarios se animan a digitalizar La Biblia,
compuesta de varios libros, cada cual puede tratarse por separado y
ocupar un archivo diferente.

Michael tambien empieza a digitar la obra completa de Shakespeare, con
la ayuda de voluntarios, una obra de teatro tras otra, cada una en un
archivo. De hecho aquella edicion nunca se puede poner en linea, debido
a que, entre tanto, entra en vigor una ley de copyright mas rigurosa,
ya no destinada a proteger el texto de Shakespeare, pasado desde hace
tiempo al dominio publico, sino los comentarios y notas de aquella
edicion. Otras ediciones anotadas que si han pasado al dominio publico
se ponen en linea algunos anos mas tarde.

# De 10 a 1.000 ebooks

En agosto de 1989, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea su decimo texto,
The King James Bible, una biblia publicada por primera vez en 1611 y
cuya version mas conocida es la de 1769. El conjunto de los archivos
del Antiguo Testamento y del Nuevo Testamento representa 5 M
(megabytes).

En 1990, ya hay 250.000 internautas, y el modelo estandar vigente es el
disquete de 360 K (kilobytes).

En enero de 1991, Michael digita Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
(Alicia en el pais de las maravillas, 1865) de Lewis Carroll. En julio
del mismo ano, digita Peter Pan (1904) de James M. Barrie. Cada uno de
estos dos clasicos de la literatura infantil cabe en un disquete
estandar.

Luego llega la web, operativa a partir de 1991. El primer navegador,
Mosaic, aparece en noviembre de 1993. Al generalizarse el acceso a la
red, resulta mas facil hacer circular los textos electronicos y
reclutar voluntarios.

El Proyecto Gutenberg perfecciona su metodo de trabajo, y logra
digitalizar un texto al mes en 1991, dos textos al mes en 1992, cuatro
textos al mes en 1993 y ocho textos al mes en 1994.

En enero de 1994, el Proyecto Gutenberg celebra su eBook #100 con la
puesta en linea de The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (La obra
completa de William Shakespeare). Shakespeare escribio la mayor parte
de su obra entre 1590 y 1613.

A continuacion la produccion sigue aumentando, con una media de 8
ebooks al mes en 1994, 16 ebooks al mes en 1995 y 32 ebooks al mes en
1996.

Entre 1991 y 1996, la produccion se ha duplicado cada ano. Mientras
sigue con la digitalizacion de los libros, Michael coordina tambien a
partir de entonces el trabajo de decenas de voluntarios.

En 1997, la produccion sigue siendo de 32 ebooks al mes. En junio de
1997, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea The Merry Adventures of Robin
Hood (Las alegres aventuras de Robin Hood, 1883) de Howard Pyle. En
agosto de 1997, se pone en linea el eBook #1000, La Divina Commedia (La
Divina Comedia, 1321) de Dante Alighieri, en su idioma original, el
italiano.

El Proyecto Gutenberg se articula en torno a tres grandes sectores: (a)
"Light Literature"(literatura de entretenimiento), que incluye por
ejemplo Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Las aventuras de Alicia en el
pais de las maravillas), Peter Pan o Aesop's Fables (Las Fabulas de
Esopo); (b) "Heavy Literature" (literatura "seria"), que incluye por
ejemplo La Biblia, las obras de Shakespeare o Moby Dick; (c) "Reference
Literature" (literatura de referencia), que reune enciclopedias y
diccionarios, por ejemplo el Roget's Thesaurus. Mas adelante, esta
presentacion en tres sectores es sustituida por una clasificacion
detallada con mas secciones.

El Proyecto Gutenberg pretende ser universal, tanto a nivel de las
obras que selecciona como del publico al que se dirige, ya que la meta
es poner la literatura a disposicion de todos, sin limitarse al publico
habitual de estudiantes y docentes.

El sector dedicado a la literatura de entretenimiento se propone atraer
frente a la pantalla a un publico muy diverso, por ejemplo a ninos y a
sus abuelos en busca del texto electronico de Peter Pan despues de
haber visto la pelicula Hook, de la version electronica de Alicia en el
pais de las maravillas tras haber visto una adaptacion televisiva, o
del origen de una cita literaria tras visionar un episodio de Star
Trek. En casi todos los episodios de Star Trek se citan libros
disponibles en version digital en el Proyecto Gutenberg.

El objetivo, entonces, es que el publico, este o no este acostumbrado
al contacto con el libro impreso, pueda encontrar con facilidad los
textos escuchados en conversaciones, peliculas, musicas, o leidos en
otros libros, periodicos y revistas.

Los textos electronicos (llamados tambien "etexts" o "ebooks") estan
almacenados bajo la forma mas sencilla posible, en formato ASCII
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange - Codigo
Estadounidense Estandar para el Intercambio de Informacion), para que
esos textos pudieran ser leidos sin problema con cualquier plataforma y
software. Los terminos escritos en cursiva o en negrita y los terminos
subrayados en la version impresa estan en letras capitales. Los
archivos ASCII no ocupan mucho espacio y se pueden descargar
facilmente. La busqueda textual es igual de sencilla. Basta con
utilizar la funcion "buscar" presente en cualquier software.

Michael Hart explica en agosto de 1998 en una entrevista por correo
electronico: "Nosotros consideramos el texto electronico como un nuevo
medio de comunicacion, sin verdadera relacion con el papel. La unica
semejanza es que ambos difundimos las mismas obras, pero en cuanto la
gente se haya acostumbrado, no veo como el papel aun podria competir
con el texto electronico, sobre todo en las escuelas. ... Mi proyecto
es cargar 10.000 textos electronicos en el internet [esta meta se
alcanza en octubre de 2003]. Si pudiera conseguir subvenciones mas
importantes, me gustaria llegar hasta un millon y ampliar tambien el
numero de nuestros usuarios potenciales pasando de un 1,x% a un 10% de
la poblacion mundial, lo que representaria la distribucion de 1.000
veces un billon de textos electronicos en lugar de un solo billon."

# De 1.000 a 10.000 ebooks

Entre 1998 y 2000, la produccion sigue constante, con una media de 36
nuevos ebooks al mes. En mayo de 1999, las colecciones cuentan con
2.000 libros digitales. El eBook #2000 es Don Quijote (publicado en
1605), en castellano.

Distributed Proofreaders (DP) es lanzado en octubre de 2000 por Charles
Franks para repartir la correccion de las obras entre varias personas.
Los voluntarios eligen uno de los libros digitales disponibles en el
sitio web para releer y corregir determinada pagina. Cada cual trabaja
a su ritmo. A titulo indicativo, se aconseja repasar una pagina al dia.
Representa poco tiempo en un dia, pero mucho para el proyecto.

Disponible en diciembre del ano 2000, el eBook #3000 es el tercer
volumen de A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (A la sombra de las
muchachas en flor, 1919) de Marcel Proust, en su idioma original, el
frances. La media pasa a 104 nuevos ebooks al mes en 2001.

El Project Gutenberg Australia es lanzado en agosto de 2001.

Disponible en octubre de 2001, el eBook #4000 es The French Immortals
Series (Obras de los Inmortales franceses), en version inglesa.
Publicado en 1905 por la Maison Mazarin (Paris), este libro reune
varias ficciones de escritores laureados por la Academia de la Lengua
Francesa (Academie Francaise), como Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti,
Hector Malot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet y otros.

Disponible en abril de 2002, el eBook #5000 es The Notebooks of
Leonardo da Vinci (Los cuadernos de Leonardo da Vinci), que datan de
inicios de siglo 16, en una traduccion del italiano al ingles. En 2010,
este texto aun se encuentra en el Top 100 de los libros descargados con
mas frecuencia.

En 1991, Michael Hart decidio digitalizar Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland o Peter Pan porque su version digital cupo en un disquete de
360 K (kilobytes), o sea el estandar de la epoca. Quince anos mas
tarde, en 2002, ya disponemos de disquetes de 1,44 M (megabytes) con la
posibilidad de comprimir archivos en archivos ZIP. Un archivo estandar
puede contener tres millones de caracteres, o sea mas de los necesarios
para un libro de tamano mediano, ya que una novela de 300 paginas
digitalizada en formato ASCII representa 1 M (megabyte). Un libro
voluminoso cabe en dos archivos ASCII, descargables en version normal o
en version comprimida en un archivo ZIP.

Se necesitan unas cincuenta horas para seleccionar un libro de tamano
mediano, comprobar que ha pasado al dominio publico, escanearlo,
corregirlo, formatearlo y compaginarlo.

Algunos numeros de libros se reservan para mas tarde, por ejemplo el
numero 1984 (eBook #1984) para la novela eponima de George Orwell,
publicada en 1949, que aun esta lejos de pasar al dominio publico.

Al llegar la primavera de 2002, ya cubren un cuarto de las obras del
dominio publico de libre acceso en la web, inventariadas de forma casi
exhaustiva por la Internet Public Library (IPL - Biblioteca Publica del
Internet), un buen resultado que es el fruto del trabajo paciente de
miles de voluntarios activos en numerosos paises. En 2002, las
colecciones se amplian de 203 nuevos ebooks al mes.

En noviembre de 2002, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea los 75
archivos del Human Genome Project (Proyecto del Genoma Humano, es saber
la secuenciacion del genoma humano), poco tiempo despues de su
publicacion inicial en febrero de 2001, debido a que desde el principio
ya pertenecia al dominio publico. Cada archivo se compone de decenas, o
incluso de cientos de megabytes.

1.000 ebooks en agosto de 1997, 2.000 ebooks en mayo de 1999, 3.000
ebooks en diciembre de 2000, 4.000 ebooks en octubre de 2001, 5.000
ebooks en abril de 2002, 10.000 ebooks en octubre de 2003. El eBook
#10.000 es The Magna Carta, que fue el primer texto constitucional
ingles, firmado en 1215.

Entre abril de 2002 y octubre de 2003, las colecciones se duplican,
pasando de 5.000 a 10.000 libros digitales en 18 meses. En 2003, la
produccion es de unos 348 nuevos ebooks al mes. Este crecimiento rapido
se debe a la actividad de Distributed Proofreaders (DP), concebido en
octubre de 2000 para repartir la correccion de las obras entre muchos
voluntarios.

En agosto de 2003, se pone a disposicion un CD Best of Gutenberg con
una seleccion de 600 ebooks. En diciembre de 2003, fecha en la que el
Proyecto Gutenberg alcanza la cifra de 10.000 libros digitales, se
graba en un DVD la casi totalidad de los ebooks (9.400 ebooks). Se
envian gratuitamente el CD y el DVD a cualquier persona que lo pida.
Luego cada uno queda libre de realizar todas las copias que pueda y de
distribuirlas a su alrededor en escuelas y bibliotecas.

En septiembre de 2003, el Proyecto Gutenberg lanza el Project Gutenberg
Audio eBooks, una colleccion de libros audio (leidos por el ser
humano), asi como el Sheet Music Subproject (Subproyecto para
partituras), una colleccion de partituras digitalizadas y de
grabaciones musicales. Un otro subproyecto tambien ofrece una
colleccion de imagenes.

# De 10.000 a 20.000 ebooks

En diciembre de 2003, las colecciones rondan los 11.000 libros
digitales. Varios formatos estan representados (HTML, XML, RTF, etc.)
pero el formato principal - y obligatorio - sigue siendo el ASCII. Hay
46.000 archivos en conjunto, lo que equivale a una capacidad total de
110 G (gigabytes). El 13 de febrero de 2004, fecha en la que Michael
Hart da una conferencia en la sede de la UNESCO en Paris, las
colecciones abarcan exactamente 11.340 ebooks en 25 idiomas. En mayo de
2004, los 12.500 ebooks disponibles representan 100.000 archivos en
veinte formatos diferentes, lo que equivale a una capacidad total de
135 G (gigabytes), y esta deberia duplicarse cada ano con la agregacion
de mas de 300 ebooks al mes (338 ebooks al mes en 2004).

El Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC), lanzado en 1997 para
reunir otras colecciones de libros digitales en un punto de acceso
unico, es afiliado oficialmente al Proyecto Gutenberg en 2003.

Se inicia tambien un proyecto europeo a iniciativa del Proyecto Rastko,
basado en Belgrado (Serbia). El Proyecto Gutenberg Europa y Distributed
Proofreaders Europa nacen en enero de 2004, con cien libros disponibles
para abril de 2005, en varios idiomas con el fin de reflejar la
diversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa.

En enero de 2005, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea el eBook #15000,
The Life of Reason (La vida de la razon, 1906) de George Santayana.

Si bien en febrero de 2004 solo habia libros en 25 idiomas, en julio de
2005 estan representados 42 idiomas, entre los cuales el sanscrito y
las lenguas maya.

El Project Gutenberg Australia (lanzado en agosto de 2001) celebra sus
500 libros en julio de 2005.

En enero de 2006 se crea el Project Gutenberg PrePrints para acoger
nuevos documentos que por su interes merecerian estar en linea, pero
que no pueden ser incorporados a las colecciones existentes sin su
procesamiento previo por voluntarios: colecciones incompletas, calidad
insuficiente, necesidad de conversion a otro formato, etc. Los
PrePrints cuentan con 379 ebooks en diciembre de 2006, y 2.020 ebooks
en febrero de 2009.

En diciembre de 2006, el Proyecto Gutenberg alcanza los 20.000 libros
digitales. El eBook #20000 es un libro audio, Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea (Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino, 1869), la version
inglesa de la novela de Julio Verne en frances. En 2006, la produccion
es de unos 345 nuevos ebooks al mes.

Aunque se hayan necesitado 32 anos y tres meses, de julio de 1971 a
octubre de 2003, para producir los 10.000 primeros ebooks, bastara con
solo tres anos y dos meses, de octubre de 2003 a diciembre de 2006,
para producir los 10.000 ebooks siguientes.

Por la misma fecha, el Project Gutenberg Australia ronda los 1.500
ebooks (se alcanza esta cifra en abril de 2007) y el Proyecto Gutenberg
Europa cuenta con 400 ebooks.

En diciembre de 2006 figuran 50 idiomas. Diez idiomas cuentan con
colecciones de mas de 50 libros: el ingles (17.377 libros el 16 de
diciembre de 2006), el frances (966 libros), el aleman (412 libros), el
finlandes (344 libros), el holandes (244 libros), el espanol (140
libros), el italiano (102 libros), el chino (69 libros), el portugues
(68 libros) y el tagalog (51 libros).

# De 20.000 a 30.000 ebooks

Se estrena el blog Project Gutenberg News en noviembre de 2006 a
instigacion de Mike Cook, para complementar las cartas de informacion
(semanal y mensual) que ya llevaban muchos anos de existencia.

El blog presenta por ejemplo las estadisticas de produccion semanales,
mensuales y anuales desde 2001.

La produccion semanal se eleva a 24 libros en 2001, 47 libros en 2002,
79 libros en 2003, 78 libros en 2004, 58 libros en 2005 y 80 libros en
2006.

La produccion mensual es de 104 libros en 2001, 203 libros en 2002, 348
libros en 2003, 338 libros en 2004, 252 libros en 2005 y 345 libros en
2006.

La produccion anual es de 1.244 libros en 2001, 2.432 libros en 2002,
4.176 libros en 2003, 4.058 libros en 2004, 3.019 libros en 2005 y
4.141 libros en 2006.

El Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC) ve la luz el 1 deg. de julio de 2007,
dia de la fiesta nacional, a instigacion de Michael Shepard y David
Jones. Poco despues nace Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) cuya
produccion empieza en diciembre de 2007. Los cien primeros ebooks estan
disponibles en marzo de 2008, en ingles, en frances y en italiano.

Distributed Proofreaders (DP), lanzado en octubre de 2000, cuenta con
miles de voluntarios en enero de 2008, con un total de 11.934 libros
procesados en siete anos y tres meses. Distributed Proofreaders Europa
(DP Europe), lanzado en enero de 2004, cuenta con 1.500 voluntarios.
Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC), lanzado en diciembre de 2007,
cuenta con 250 voluntarios.

El Proyecto Gutenberg alcanza los 25.000 libros digitales en abril de
2008. El eBook #25000 es English Book Collectors (Colleccionistas
ingleses de libros, 1902) de William Younger Fletcher.

El Proyecto Gutenberg Europa alcanza los 500 libros en octubre de 2008.

El Proyecto Gutenberg contabiliza 30.000 libros en octubre de 2009. El
eBook #30000 es The Bird Book (El libro de los aves, 1915), de Chester
Albert Reed.

# 30.000 ebooks y mas

Distributed Proofreaders celebra su decimo aniversario en octubre de
2010, con mas de 18.000 libros digitalizados y corregidos en diez anos
por miles de voluntarios.

El Proyecto Gutenberg cuenta con mas de 33.000 ebooks en diciembre de
2010, en varios formatos para lectura en un ordenador, un PDA, un
telefono movil, un smartphone o una tableta.



LE PROJET GUTENBERG A 40 ANS [FR]


Au 16e siecle, Gutenberg avait permis a chacun d'avoir des livres
imprimes pour un prix relativement modique. Au 21e siecle, le Projet
Gutenberg permettrait a chacun d'avoir une bibliotheque numerique
gratuite.

# Gestation

Quels furent les tous debuts du projet? Alors etudiant a l'Universite
de l'Illinois (Etats-Unis), Michael Hart se voit attribuer quelques
millions de dollars de "temps machine" dans le laboratoire informatique
de son universite.

Le 4 juillet 1971, jour de la fete nationale, il saisit The United
States Declaration of Independence (Declaration de l'independance des
Etats-Unis) sur le clavier de son ordinateur, en caracteres majuscules,
puisque les caracteres minuscules n'existent pas encore. Le texte
electronique represente 5 Ko (kilo-octets). L'envoi d'un fichier de 5
Ko a la centaine de personnes utilisant le pre-internet de l'epoque
aurait fait imploser celui-ci, la bande passante etant infime. Michael
diffuse donc un message indiquant ou le texte est stocke - sans lien
hypertexte toutefois, puisque le web ne voit le jour que vingt ans
apres - suite a quoi le fichier est telecharge par six personnes. Le
Projet Gutenberg est ne.

Dans la foulee, Michael decide de consacrer l'enorme credit-temps mis a
sa disposition a la recherche des oeuvres litteraires disponibles dans
les bibliotheques et a la numerisation de celles-ci. Au lieu d'etre un
ensemble de pages reliees, le livre sera un texte electronique pouvant
etre deroule en continu.

Peu apres, Michael definit la mission du Projet Gutenberg: mettre a la
disposition de tous gratuitement, par voie electronique, le plus grand
nombre possible d'oeuvres litteraires.

Apres avoir saisi The United States Declaration of Independence
(Declaration de l'independance des Etats-Unis, signee le 4 juillet
1776) en 1971, Michael poursuit ses efforts en 1972 en saisissant The
United States Bill of Rights (Declaration des droits des Etats-Unis).
Ce texte comprend les dix premiers amendements ajoutes en 1789 a la
Constitution des Etats-Unis (qui date elle-meme de 1787), et
definissant les droits individuels des citoyens et les pouvoirs
respectifs du gouvernement federal et des Etats. En 1973, un volontaire
saisit The United States Constitution (Constitution des Etats-Unis)
dans son entier.

L'internet, qui etait encore embryonnaire en 1971, debute veritablement
en 1974, suite a la creation du protocole TCP/IP (Transmission Control
Protocol / Internet Protocol).

D'annee en annee, la capacite de la disquette augmente regulierement -
le disque dur n'existe pas encore -, si bien qu'il est possible
d'envisager des fichiers de plus en plus volumineux. Des volontaires
entreprennent la numerisation de La Bible, composee elle-meme de
plusieurs livres pouvant etre traites separement et occuper chacun un
fichier different.

Michael Hart debute la saisie des oeuvres completes de Shakespeare,
avec l'aide de volontaires, une piece de theatre apres l'autre, avec un
fichier pour chaque piece. Cette version n'est d'ailleurs jamais mise
en ligne, du fait d'une loi plus contraignante sur le copyright entree
en vigueur dans l'intervalle, et qui vise non pas le texte de
Shakespeare, tombe depuis longtemps dans le domaine public, mais les
commentaires et notes de l'edition correspondante. D'autres editions
annotees appartenant au domaine public sont mises en ligne quelques
annees plus tard.

# De 10 a 1.000 ebooks

En aout 1989, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #10, The King
James Bible, une bible publiee pour la premiere fois en 1611 et dont la
version la plus connue date de 1769. L'ensemble des fichiers de
l'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament represente 5 Mo (mega-
octets).

En 1990, les internautes sont au nombre de 250.000, et le standard en
vigueur est la disquette de 360 Ko. En janvier 1991, Michael Hart
saisit Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice au pays des merveilles,
1865) de Lewis Carroll. En juillet de la meme annee, il saisit Peter
Pan (1904) de James M. Barrie. Ces deux classiques de la litterature
enfantine tiennent chacun sur une disquette standard.

Arrive ensuite le web, operationnel en 1991. Le premier navigateur,
Mosaic, apparait en novembre 1993. Lorsque l'utilisation du web se
generalise, il devient plus facile de faire circuler les textes
electroniques et de recruter des volontaires.

Le Projet Gutenberg rode sa methode de travail, avec la numerisation
d'un texte par mois en 1991, deux textes par mois en 1992, quatre
textes par mois en 1993 et huit textes par mois en 1994.

En janvier 1994, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #100, The
Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Les oeuvres completes de William
Shakespeare). Shakespeare ecrivit l'essentiel de son oeuvre entre 1590
et 1613.

La production continue ensuite d'augmenter, avec une moyenne de 16
nouveaux titres par mois en 1995 et 32 nouveaux titres par mois en
1996.

Comme on le voit, entre 1991 et 1996, la production double chaque
annee. Tout en continuant de numeriser des livres, Michael coordonne
desormais le travail de dizaines de volontaires.

En 1997, la production est toujours de 32 nouveaux titres par mois. En
juin 1997, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne The Merry Adventures of
Robin Hood (Les aventures de Robin des Bois, 1883) de Howard Pyle. En
aout 1997, il met en ligne l'eBook #1000, La Divina Commedia (La Divine
Comedie, 1321) de Dante Alighieri, dans sa langue d'origine, en
italien.

A l'epoque, le Projet Gutenberg s'articule en trois grands secteurs:
(a) "Light Literature" (litterature de divertissement), qui inclut par
exemple Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Peter Pan ou Aesop's Fables
(Fables d'Esope); (b) "Heavy Literature" (litterature "serieuse"), qui
inclut par exemple La Bible, les oeuvres de Shakespeare ou Moby Dick;
(c) "Reference Literature" (litterature de reference), composee
d'encyclopedies et de dictionnaires, par exemple le Roget's Thesaurus.
Un classement par rubriques plus detaille remplacera par la suite ces
trois secteurs.

Le Projet Gutenberg se veut universel, aussi bien pour les oeuvres
choisies que pour le public vise, le but etant de mettre la litterature
a la disposition de tous, en depassant largement le public habituel des
etudiants et des enseignants. Le secteur consacre a la litterature de
divertissement est destine a amener devant l'ecran un public tres
divers, par exemple des enfants et leurs grands-parents recherchant le
texte electronique de Peter Pan apres avoir vu le film Hook, ou
recherchant la version electronique d'Alice au pays des merveilles
apres avoir regarde l'adaptation filmee a la television, ou recherchant
l'origine d'une citation litteraire apres avoir vu un episode de Star
Trek. Pratiquement tous les episodes de Star Trek citent des livres
ayant leur correspondant numerique dans le Projet Gutenberg.

L'objectif est donc que le public, qu'il soit familier ou non avec le
livre imprime, puisse facilement retrouver des textes entendus dans des
conversations, des films, des musiques, ou alors lus dans d'autres
livres, journaux et magazines.

Les textes electroniques (appeles "etexts" ou "ebooks") sont stockes de
la maniere la plus simple possible, au format ASCII (American Standard
Code for Information Interchange), pour que ces textes puissent etre
lus sans probleme quels que soient la plateforme et le logiciel
utilises. Des lettres capitales remplacent les termes en italique, en
gras et soulignes de la version imprimee. Les fichiers electroniques
prennent peu de place et peuvent etre facilement telecharges. La
recherche textuelle est tout aussi simple. Il suffit d'utiliser la
fonction "rechercher" presente dans n'importe quel logiciel.

Michael Hart ecrit en aout 1998 lors d'un entretien par courriel: "Nous
considerons le texte electronique comme un nouveau medium, sans
veritable relation avec le papier. Le seul point commun est que nous
diffusons les memes oeuvres, mais je ne vois pas comment le papier peut
concurrencer le texte electronique une fois que les gens y sont
habitues, particulierement dans les etablissements d'enseignement....
Mon projet est de mettre 10.000 textes electroniques sur l'internet.
[NDLR: Ce sera chose faite en octobre 2003.] Si je pouvais avoir des
subventions importantes, j'aimerais aller jusqu'a un million et etendre
aussi le nombre de nos usagers potentiels de 1,x% a 10% de la
population mondiale, ce qui representerait la diffusion de 1.000 fois
un milliard de textes electroniques, au lieu d'un milliard seulement."

# De 1.000 a 10.000 ebooks

Entre 1998 et 2000, la moyenne est constante, avec 36 nouveaux titres
par mois. En mai 1999, les collections comptent 2.000 livres
numeriques. L'eBook #2000 est Don Quijote (Don Quichotte, 1605) de
Cervantes, dans sa langue d'origine, en espagnol.

Distributed Proofreaders (DP) est lance en octobre 2000 par Charles
Franks pour permettre la correction partagee des livres entre de
nombreux volontaires. Les volontaires choisissent un livre en cours de
traitement pour relire et corriger une page donnee. Chacun travaille a
son propre rythme. A titre indicatif, il est conseille de relire une
page par jour. C'est peu de temps sur une journee, et c'est beaucoup
pour le projet.

Disponible en decembre 2000, l'eBook #3000 est le troisieme volume de A
l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (1919) de Marcel Proust, dans sa
langue d'origine, en francais. La moyenne passe a 104 livres par mois
en 2001.

Le Project Gutenberg Australia voir le jour en aout 2001.

Mis en ligne en octobre 2001, l'eBook #4000 est The French Immortals
Series (Collection de textes d'Immortels francais), dans sa traduction
anglaise. Publie a Paris en 1905 par la Maison Mazarin, ce livre
rassemble plusieurs fictions d'ecrivains couronnes par l'Academie
francaise, comme Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de
Bernard, Alphonse Daudet, etc.

Disponible en avril 2002, l'eBook #5000 est The Notebooks of Leonardo
da Vinci (Les Carnets de Leonard de Vinci), des carnets datant du debut
du 16e siecle et traduits de l'italien vers l'anglais. Ces carnets ont
constamment ete dans le Top 100 des livres telecharges depuis leur mise
en ligne.

En 1991, Michael Hart avait choisi de numeriser Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland et Peter Pan parce que, dans l'un et l'autre cas, leur
version numerisee tenait sur une disquette de 360 Ko, le standard de
l'epoque. Quinze ans plus tard, en 2002, on dispose de disquettes de
1,44 Mo et on peut aisement compresser les fichiers en les zippant. Un
fichier standard peut desormais comporter trois millions de caracteres,
plus qu'il n'en faut pour un livre de taille moyenne, puisqu'un roman
de 300 pages numerise au format ASCII represente un mega-octet. Un
livre volumineux tient sur deux fichiers ASCII, telechargeables tels
quels ou en version zippee.

Cinquante heures environ sont necessaires pour selectionner un livre de
taille moyenne, verifier qu'il est bien du domaine public, le scanner,
le corriger, le formater et le mettre en page.

Quelques numeros de livres sont reserves pour l'avenir, par exemple le
numero 1984 (eBook #1984) pour le roman eponyme de George Orwell,
publie en 1949, et qui est donc loin d'etre tombe dans le domaine
public.

Au printemps 2002, les collections representent le quart des oeuvres du
domaine public en acces libre sur le web, recensees de maniere
pratiquement exhaustive par l'Internet Public Library (IPL), un beau
resultat du au patient travail de milliers de volontaires actifs dans
de nombreux pays. En 2002, la production est   de 203 nouveaux titres
par mois.

En novembre 2002, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne les 75 fichiers du
Human Genome Project (Projet du genome humain, a savoir le sequencage
du genome humain), ceci peu de temps apres sa parution initiale en
fevrier 2001, puisqu'il appartient d'emblee au domaine public. Chaque
fichier se chiffre en dizaines sinon en centaines de mega-octets.

1.000 livres en aout 1997, 2.000 livres en mai 1999, 3.000 livres en
decembre 2000, 4.000 livres en octobre 2001, 5.000 livres en avril
2002, 10.000 livres en octobre 2003. L'eBook #10000 est The Magna
Carta, qui fut le premier texte constitutionnel anglais, signe en 1215.

Entre avril 2002 et octobre 2003, les collections doublent, passant de
5.000 a 10.000 livres en dix-huit mois. La moyenne mensuelle est de 348
nouveaux titres en 2003. Cette croissance rapide est due a l'activite
de Distributed Proofreaders (DP), un site concu en octobre 2000 pour
permettre la correction partagee des livres entre de nombreux
volontaires.

En aout 2003, un CD Best of Gutenberg est disponible avec une selection
de 600 ebooks. En decembre 2003, date a laquelle le Projet Gutenberg
fete ses 10.000 ebooks, la quasi-totalite de ceux-ci (9.400 ebooks) est
gravee sur un DVD. CD et DVD sont envoyes gratuitement a qui en fait la
demande. Libre ensuite a chacun de faire autant de copies que possible
et de les distribuer autour de soi dans des ecoles et des
bibliotheques.

En septembre 2003, le Projet Gutenberg lance le Projet Gutenberg Audio
eBooks, une collection de livres audio (lus par l'etre humain), ainsi
que le Sheet Music Subproject (Sous-projet pour les partitions
musicales), une collection rassemblant des partitions musicales et des
enregistrements musicaux. Un autre sous-projet rassemble des images
fixes et animees.

# De 10.000 a 20.000 ebooks

En decembre 2003, les collections approchent les 11.000 ebooks.
Plusieurs formats sont desormais presents, par exemple les formats
HTML, XML et RTF, le format principal - et obligatoire - restant
l'ASCII. Le tout represente 46.000 fichiers, soit une capacite totale
de 110 Go (giga-octets). Le 13 fevrier 2004, date de la conference de
Michael Hart au siege de l'UNESCO a Paris, les collections comprennent
tres exactement 11.340 ebooks dans 25 langues. En mai 2004, les 12.500
ebooks disponibles representent 100.000 fichiers dans une vingtaine de
formats, soit une capacite totale de 135 Go, destinee a doubler chaque
annee avec l'ajout d'environ 300 ebooks par mois (338 ebooks en 2004).

Parallelement, le Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC), qui avait
ete lance en 1997 pour rassembler des collections de livres numeriques
deja existantes et provenant de sources diverses, est officiellement
affilie au Projet Gutenberg en 2003.

Le Projet Gutenberg Europe est lance en janvier 2004 a l'instigation du
Projet Rastko, base a Belgrade, en Serbie. Distributed Proofreaders
Europe debute la production de livres numeriques a la meme date, avec
cent livres disponibles en avril 2005. Les livres sont en plusieurs
langues pour refleter la diversite linguistique prevalant en Europe.

En janvier 2005, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #15000, The
Life of Reason (La vie de raison, 1906) de George Santayana.

En juin 2005, le nombre de livres s'eleve a 16.000. Si 25 langues
seulement etaient presentes en fevrier 2004, 42 langues sont
representees en juin 2005, dont le sanscrit et les langues mayas.

Le Project Gutenberg Australia (lance en aout 2001) fete ses 500 livres
en juillet 2005.

Un nouveau secteur, denomme Project Gutenberg PrePrints, est lance en
janvier 2006 pour accueillir de nouveaux documents suffisamment
interessants pour etre mis en ligne, mais ne pouvant etre integres aux
collections du Projet Gutenberg sans traitement ulterieur par des
volontaires, pour diverses raisons: collections incompletes, qualite
insuffisante, conversion souhaitee dans un autre format, etc. Les
PrePrints comprennent 379 ebooks en decembre 2006, et 2.020 ebooks en
fevrier 2009.

En decembre 2006, le Projet Gutenberg franchit la barre des 20.000
livres. L'eBook #20000 est un livre audio, Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea, version anglaise du roman Vingt mille lieues sous les
mers (1869) de Jules Verne. La moyenne est de 345 nouveaux titres par
mois en 2006.

S'il a fallu 32 ans et deux mois, de juillet 1971 a octobre 2003, pour
numeriser les 10.000 premiers livres, il n'aura fallu que trois ans et
deux mois, d'octobre 2003 a decembre 2006, pour numeriser les 10.000
livres suivants.

A la meme date, le Project Gutenberg Australia approche les 1.500
livres (c'est chose faite en avril 2007) et le Projet Gutenberg Europe
compte 400 livres.

En decembre 2006, on compte 50 langues. Les dix langues comprenant plus
de cinquante livres sont l'anglais (17.377 livres le 16 decembre 2006),
le francais (966 livres), l'allemand (412 livres), le finnois (344
livres), le hollandais (244 livres), l'espagnol (140 livres), l'italien
(102 livres), le chinois (69 livres), le portugais (68 livres) et le
tagalog (51 livres).

# De 20.000 a 30.000 ebooks

Project Gutenberg News, le blog officiel du Projet Gutenberg, debute en
novembre 2006 a l'instigation de Mike Cook. Ce blog complete les
lettres d'information (hebdomadaire et mensuelle) existant depuis

FROM THE PAST TO THE FUTURE [EN]


The results of Project Gutenberg are not only measured in numbers. The
results can also be measured in the major influence the project has
had.

# Other digital libraries

As the oldest producer of free ebooks on the internet, Project
Gutenberg has inspired many other digital libraries, for example
Projekt Runeberg for classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature, and
Projekt Gutenberg-DE for classic German literature, which started
respectively in 1992 and 1994.

Projekt Runeberg was the first Swedish digital library of books from
public domain, and a partner of Project Gutenberg. It was initiated in
December 1992 by the students' computer club Lysator, in cooperation
with the Linkoeping University (Sweden), as a volunteer project to
create and collect free electronic editions of classic Nordic
literature and art. Around 200 ebooks were available in full text in
1998. There was also a list of 6,000 Nordic authors as a tool for
further collection development.

Projekt Gutenberg-DE was the first German digital library of books from
public domain, created in 1994 as a partner of Project Gutenberg. Texts
were available for online reading, with one webpage for short texts and
with several webpages - one per chapter - for longer works. There was
an alphabetic list of authors and titles, and a short biography and
bibliography for each author.

# "Less is more."

Project Gutenberg has kept its administrative and financial structure
to the bare minimum. Its motto fits into three words: "Less is more."
The goal is to ensure its independence from loans and other funding,
and from ephemeral cultural priorities, to avoid pressure from
politicians and others. The goal is also to ensure respect for the
volunteers, who can be confident their work will be used for decades.
Volunteers can network through mailing lists, weekly or monthly
newsletters, discussion lists, forums, and wikis. Founded in 2000, the
PGLAF (Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation) has only three
part-time employees.

Donations are used to buy equipment and supplies, mostly computers,
scanners, and blank CDs and DVDs. CDs and DVDs are sent for free to
those who request them. After the CD Best of Gutenberg available in
August 2003 with a selection of 600 ebooks, and a first DVD available
in December 2003 with 9,400 ebooks, a second DVD is available in July
2006 with 17,000 ebooks. Since 2005, CDs and DVDs have been both
available on the website of BitTorrent as ISO images that can be
downloaded to burn CDs and DVDs for personal use. In 2007, the Project
Gutenberg sent 15 million books by snail mail on CDs and DVDs.

More generally, Michael Hart should be given more credit as the
inventor of the electronic book (ebook). If we consider the ebook in
its etymological sense - i.e. a book that has been digitized to be
distributed as an electronic file - it was born with Project Gutenberg
in July 1971, 30 years before the various commercial launchings that
peppered the early 2000s, with the ebooks of Amazon, Barnes & Noble,
Gemstar, and others.

# Tens of thousands of downloads per day

There is a big demand, as confirmed by the tens of thousands of books
that are downloaded every day.

For example, on July 31, 2005, there were 37,532 downloads for the day,
243,808 downloads for the week, and 1,154,765 downloads for the month.

On May 6, 2007, there were 89,841 downloads for the day, 697,818
downloads for the week, and 2,995,436 downloads for the month.

On November 15, 2010, there were 130,524 downloads for the day, 888,520
downloads for the week, and 3,582,153 downloads for the month.

These numbers are the downloads from ibiblio.org (at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States), the main distribution
site, which also hosts the website gutenberg.org. The Internet Archive
is the backup distribution site and provides unlimited disk space for
storage and processing. Project Gutenberg has 40 mirror sites
worldwide, and seeks new ones. It also encourages the use of P2P for
sharing its ebooks.

Readers can choose ebooks from the "Top 100?, i.e. the top 100 ebooks
and the top 100 authors for the previous day, the last seven days and
the last thirty days.

Project Gutenberg ebooks can also help bridge the "digital divide".
They can be read on an outdated computer or a second-hand netbook
costing just a few dollars.

# Towards the future

It is hoped machine translation software will be able to convert the
ebooks from one to another of 100 languages. In ten years from now,
machine translation may be judged 99% satisfactory - research is active
on that front, and software is improving fast - allowing for the
reading of literary classics in a choice of many languages. Project
Gutenberg is also interested in combining translation software and
human translators, somewhat as OCR software is now combined with the
work of proofreaders.

40 years after the beginning of Project Gutenberg, Michael Hart
describes himself as a workaholic who has devoted his entire life to
his project. He considers himself a pragmatic and farsighted altruist.
For years he was regarded as a nut but now he is respected. He wants to
change the world through freely-available ebooks that can be used and
copied endlessly, and reading and culture for everyone at minimal cost.

Project Gutenberg's mission can be stated in eight words: "To encourage
the creation and distribution of ebooks," by everybody, and by every
possible means, while implementing new ideas, new methods, and new
software.



DESDE EL PASADO HACIA EL FUTURO [ES]


Los resultados del Proyecto Gutenberg no se miden solo en cifras. Los
resultados se miden tambien por la influencia que ha tenido el
proyecto, pues esta ha sido enorme.

# Otras bibliotecas digitales

El Proyecto Gutenberg - primera pagina web de informacion en el
internet y primera biblioteca digital -, inspira muchas otras
bibliotecas digitales, por ejemplo el Projekt Runeberg para la
literatura escandinava o el Projekt Gutenberg-DE para la literatura
alemana.

El Projekt Runeberg es la primera biblioteca digital sueca de libros
del dominio publico, y un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg. Esta biblioteca
es creada en diciembre de 1992 por Lysator, un club informatico de
estudiantes, en colaboracion con la biblioteca de la Universidad de
Linkoeping (Suecia), para producir y organizar versiones electronicas
gratuitas de obras de literatura nordica (escandinava) clasica. 200
obras estan disponibles en 1998, con una lista de 6.000 autores
nordicos para el desarrollo de las colecciones futuras.

El Projekt Gutenberg-DE es la primera biblioteca digital alemana de
libros del dominio publico, y tambien un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg.
Se pueden leer decenas de textos en linea en 1998, con una pagina web
para textos cortos y varias paginas web - uno por capitulo - para obras
mas largas. Una lista alfabetica de autores y de titulos esta
disponible en el sitio, con una breve biografia y bibliografia para
cada autor.

# Una estructura tan simple como posible

La estructura administrativa y financiera del Proyecto Gutenberg se
limita al minimo estricto. Michael Hart insiste frecuentemente sobre la
necesidad de preservar un marco lo mas flexible posible que deje campo
libre a los voluntarios, y la puerta abierta para las nuevas ideas. El
objetivo es garantizar la perennidad del proyecto, sin depender ni de
creditos y cortes de creditos, ni de las prioridades culturales,
financieras y politicas del momento. De este modo no puede ejercerse
ninguna forma de presion por el poder o el dinero. Ademas esto
significa respeto para con los voluntarios, quienes pueden estar
seguros de que veran su trabajo utilizado durante muchos anos. En
cuanto a la supervision regular del proyecto, se garantiza gracias a
cartas de informacion semanales y mensuales, foros de discusion, wikis
y blogs.

Las donaciones sirven para financiar ordenadores y escaneres, y para
enviar CD y DVD gratuitos a aquellos que los solicitan. Despues del CD
"Best of Gutenberg" disponible en agosto de 2003 con una seleccion de
600 libros y de un primer DVD disponible en diciembre de 2003 con 9.400
libros, un segundo DVD esta disponible en julio de 2006 con 17.000
libros. A partir de 2005, CD y DVD ambos estan disponibles en el sitio
web de BitTorrent, bajo la forma de imagenes ISO que se pueden
descargar con el fin de grabar CD y DVD a titulo personal. En 2007, el
Proyecto Gutenberg envia 15 millones de libros por correo postal bajo
la forma de CD y DVD.

Aunque demasiadas veces se silencie, cabe recordar que el verdadero
inventor del ebook es Michael Hart. Si tomamos la palabra "ebook" en su
sentido etimologico - a saber un libro digital para difusion bajo la
forma de un archivo electronico - habria nacido con el Proyecto
Gutenberg en julio de 1971, 30 anos antes de los diversos lanzamientos
comerciales que salpicaron el principio de los anos 2000 con los ebooks
de Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Gemstar y demas.

# Decenas de miles de descargas al dia

La demanda es enorme, a prueba de ello el numero de descargas, que se
cifran en decenas de miles diarias.

A fecha del 31 de julio de 2005, se cuenta con 37.532 archivos
descargados al dia, 243.808 archivos a la semana y 1.154.765 archivos
al mes.

A fecha del 6 de mayo de 2007, se cuenta con 89.841 archivos
descargados al dia, 697.818 archivos a la semana y 2.995.436 archivos
al mes.

A fecha del 15 de noviembre de 2010, se cuenta con 130.524 archivos
descargados al dia, 888.520 archivos a la semana y 3.582.153 archivos
al mes.

Y esto solo concierne el sitio web de descargas principal, ibiblio.org
(basado en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, Estados Unidos), que
alberga tambien el sitio web del Proyecto Gutenberg. El segundo sitio
web de descargas es el del Internet Archive, que tambien sirve de copia
de seguridad y le proporciona al
Proyecto Gutenberg une capacidad de almacenamiento ilimitada.

Un Top 100 inventaria los cien titulos y los cien autores que mas han
sido descargados durante el dia, la semana y el mes.

El Proyecto Gutenberg dispone de 40 sitios web espejo repartidos en
toda la planeta, y aun necesita encontrar otros. Los archivos tambien
circulan en modo P2P (peer-to-peer), lo que permite a cualquier
utilizador intercambiar directamente archivos con otro utilizador.

Los libros del Proyecto Gutenberg pueden ayudar a colmar la fractura
digital. Es muy sencillo descargarlos en un ordenador o un dispositivo
movil de segunda mano que no cuestan mas de unos dolares o decenas de
dolares.

# Hacia el futuro

Mas adelante, quizas se pueda contemplar la idea de una traduccion
simultanea a unos cien idiomas, utilizando un programa de traduccion
automatica con un margen de fiabilidad del orden de 99% en el futuro.
Los textos generados por el software de traduccion automatica pasarian
luego en manos de traductores (no maquinas, sino seres humanos) para
hacerles algunos retoques, siguiendo un modelo parecido al de la
tecnologia OCR, que no puede prescindir de los correctores (no de los
software, sino de los seres humanos) para ofrecer un contenido de
calidad optima.

Cuarenta anos despues de la creacion del Proyecto Gutenberg, Michael
Hart se define aun como un adicto al trabajo que sigue dedicandose
enteramente a su proyecto, proyecto que en su opinion esta al origen de
una revolucion neo-industrial. Se define tambien a si mismo como un
altruista, pragmatico y visionario. Tras haber sido tildado de chiflado
durante anos, ahora suscita el respeto.

Con el pasar de los anos, la mision del Proyecto Gutenberg nunca ha
dejado de ser la misma, a saber la de cambiar el mundo mediante el
ebook gratuito, de uso infinito y repetible. El objetivo tambien sigue
siendo el mismo, es decir la lectura gratis y la cultura para todos.

En cuanto a la mision, se resume en pocas palabras: "fomentar la
creacion y la distribucion de los ebooks", por cuantas personas sea
posible, por todos los medios posibles, y aceptando tambien los virajes
necesarios para integrar nuevas ideas, nuevos metodos y nuevos
soportes.



DU PASSE VERS L'AVENIR [FR]


Les resultats du Projet Gutenberg ne se mesurent pas seulement a des
chiffres. Les resultats se mesurent aussi a l'influence du projet, qui
est considerable.

# D'autres bibliotheques numeriques

Premier site d'information sur l'internet et premiere bibliotheque
numerique, le Projet Gutenberg inspire bien d'autres bibliotheques
numeriques au fil des ans, a commencer par le Projekt Runeberg pour la
litterature scandinave et le Projekt Gutenberg-DE pour la litterature
allemande.

Le Projekt Runeberg est la premiere bibliotheque numerique suedoise de
livres du domaine public, creee en decembre 1992 par Lysator, un club
informatique d'etudiants, en collaboration avec la bibliotheque de
l'Universite de Linkoeping (Suede). Le but est de produire et organiser
des  versions electroniques gratuites de la litterature nordique
classique. 200 oeuvres sont disponibles en 1998, avec une liste de
6.000 auteurs nordiques en tant qu'outil de developpement des
collections.

Projekt Gutenberg-DE est la premiere bibliotheque numerique allemande
de livres du domaine public. Plusieurs dizaines de textes peuvent etre
lus en ligne en 1998, avec une page web pour les textes courts et
plusieurs pages - une par chapitre - pour les oeuvres plus longues. Une
liste alphabetique d'auteurs et de titres est egalement disponible,
ainsi qu'une courte biographie et bibliographie pour chaque auteur.

# Une structure aussi simple que possible

La structure administrative et financiere du Projet Gutenberg se limite
au strict minimum, avec une devise qui tient en trois mots: "Less is
more". Michael Hart insiste regulierement sur la necessite d'un cadre
aussi souple que possible laissant toute initiative aux volontaires, et
la porte grande ouverte aux idees nouvelles. Le but est d'assurer la
perennite du projet independamment des credits, des coupures de credits
et des priorites culturelles, financieres et politiques du moment. Pas
de pression possible donc par le pouvoir et par l'argent. Et respect a
l'egard des volontaires, qui sont assures de voir leur travail utilise
pendant de nombreuses annees. Le suivi regulier du projet est assure
grace a une lettre d'information hebdomadaire et mensuelle, des forums
de discussion, des wikis et des blogs.

Les dons servent a financer des ordinateurs et des scanners, et a
envoyer des CD et DVD gratuits a tous ceux qui en font la demande.
Suite au CD Best of Gutenberg disponible en aout 2003 avec une
selection de 600 titres, un premier DVD est disponible en decembre 2003
avec 9.400 titres, suivi d'un deuxieme DVD disponible en juillet 2006
avec 17.000 titres. A partir de 2005, CD et DVD sont disponibles sous
forme d'images ISO sur le site de BitTorrent, ces images pouvant etre
telechargees pour graver des CD et DVD sur place a titre personnel. En
2007, le Projet Gutenberg envoie 15 millions de livres par voie postale
sous forme de CD et DVD.

Chose souvent passee sous silence, Michael Hart est le veritable
inventeur de l'ebook. Si on considere l'ebook dans son sens
etymologique, a savoir un livre numerise pour diffusion sous forme de
fichier electronique, celui-ci serait ne avec le Projet Gutenberg en
juillet 1971, trente ans avant les divers lancements commerciaux ayant
emaille le debut des annees 2000 avec les ebooks d'Amazon, Barnes &
Noble, Gemstar et autres.

# Des dizaines de milliers de telechargements par jour

La demande est enorme. En temoigne le nombre de telechargements, qui se
comptent  en dizaines de milliers par jour.

A la date du 31 juillet 2005, on compte 37.532 fichiers telecharges
dans la journee, 243.808 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et
1.154.765 fichiers telecharges dans le mois.

A la date du 6 mai 2007, on compte 89.841 fichiers telecharges dans la
journee, 697.818 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et 2.995.436
fichiers telecharges dans le mois. Courant mai, ce nombre atteint les 3
millions.

A la date du 15 novembre 2010, on compte 130.524 fichiers telecharges
dans la journee, 888.520 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et
3.582.153 fichiers telecharges dans le mois.

Ceci uniquement pour le principal site de telechargement, ibiblio.org
(base a l'Universite de Caroline du Nord, aux Etats-Unis), qui heberge
aussi le site du Projet Gutenberg. Le deuxieme site de telechargement
est l'Internet Archive, qui est le site de sauvegarde et qui met a la
disposition du Projet Gutenberg une capacite de stockage illimitee.

Un "Top 100" recense les cent titres et les cent auteurs les plus
telecharges dans la journee, dans la semaine et dans le mois.

Le Projet Gutenberg dispose de 40 sites miroirs repartis sur toute la
planete, et il en cherche d'autres. La circulation des fichiers se fait
aussi en mode P2P (Peer-to-Peer), qui permet d'echanger des fichiers
directement d'un utilisateur a l'autre.

Les livres du Projet Gutenberg peuvent aider a combler la fracture
numerique. Ils sont aisement telechargeables sur un ordinateur ou un
netbook d'occasion ne coutant que quelques dollars ou quelques dizaines
de dollars.

# Vers l'avenir

Plus tard, il sera peut-etre possible d'envisager une traduction
simultanee dans une centaine de langues, en utilisant un logiciel de
traduction automatique qui aurait alors un taux de fiabilite de l'ordre
de 99%, un pourcentage dont on est encore loin. Ce logiciel de
traduction automatique serait relaye par des traducteurs (non pas des
machines, mais des etres humains), sur un modele comparable a la
technologie OCR actuellement relayee par des correcteurs (non pas des
logiciels, mais des etres humains) pour offrir un contenu de grande
qualite.

Quarante ans apres les debuts du Projet Gutenberg, Michael Hart se
definit toujours comme un fou de travail dediant toute sa vie a son
projet, qu'il voit comme etant a l'origine d'une revolution neo-
industrielle. Il se definit aussi comme altruiste, pragmatique et
visionnaire. Apres avoir ete traite de toque pendant de nombreuses
annees, il force maintenant le respect.

Au fil des ans, la mission du Projet Gutenberg reste la meme, a savoir
changer le monde par le biais de l'ebook gratuit indefiniment
utilisable et reproductible, et favoriser ainsi la lecture et la
culture pour tous a moindres frais.

Cette mission se resume en quelques mots: "encourager la creation et la
distribution d'ebooks", par autant de personnes que possible, et par
tous les moyens de diffusion possibles, tout en prenant les virages
necessaires pour integrer de nouvelles idees, de nouvelles methodes et
de nouveaux supports.



PROJECT GUTENBERG AND LANGUAGES [EN]


Project Gutenberg mainly offers English-language ebooks, but
multilingualism has become one of its priorities. French is the second
language of the project. There were ebooks in 60 languages in December
2010.

# In 1990-94

Initially, the ebooks were in English. As Project Gutenberg was
launched from the University of Illinois (United States), with the help
of English-speaking volunteers, its first goal has been to provide
ebooks to the English-language community, that is to say 95% of
internet users in the early 1990s. (Non-English-speaking users reached
50% in summer 2000, with a percentage steadily growing ever since.)

Project Gutenberg was also inspiring other digital libraries elsewhere.
Projekt Runeberg, for classic Nordic literature, and Projekt Gutenberg-
DE, for classic German literature, started respectively in 1992 and
1994.

Projekt Runeberg was the first Swedish digital library of books from
public domain, and a partner of Project Gutenberg. It was created by
the students' computer club Lysator, in cooperation with Linkoeping
University, as a volunteer project to produce and organize free
electronic editions of classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature. Around
200 ebooks were available in 1998, with a list of 6,000 Nordic authors
as a tool for further collection development.

Projekt Gutenberg-DE was the first German digital library of books from
public domain, and also a partner of Project Gutenberg. A number of
texts were available for online reading in 1998, with one web page for
short texts and several web pages - one per chapter - for longer works.
There was an alphabetic list of authors and titles, with a short
biography and bibliography for each author.

# In 1997

French was the second language of Project Gutenberg, and still is in
2010.

The first ebooks released in French were six works by Stendhal and two
works by Jules Verne, all released in early 1997.

The six works by Stendhal were four short novels: L'Abbesse de Castro
(published in 1837), Les Cenci (1837), Vittoria Accoramboni (1837) and
La Duchesse de Palliano (1838), and two novels:  Le Rouge et le Noir
(1830) and La Chartreuse de Parme (1839).

The two novels by Jules Verne were: De la terre a la lune (1865) and Le
tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).

Three novels by Jules Verne were already available in English: From the
Earth to the Moon (original title: De la terre a la lune), released in
September 1993; Around the World in 80 Days (original title: Le tour du
monde en quatre-vingts jours), released in January 1994; and 20,000
Leagues Under the Seas (original title: Vingt mille lieues sous les
mers, 1869-70), released in September 1994.

Since then, Jules Verne has constantly been in the most downloaded
authors, at 11 in the "Top 20" available on the website of Project
Gutenberg in December 1999, and at 6 in the "Top 100 during the last 30
days", on October 7, 2010.

As a side remark, the first pictures ever made available in Project
Gutenberg were French Cave Paintings, released in April 1995 as eBook
#249, with an XHTML version available in November 2000. This ebook
offers four copyrighted photographs of paleolithic paintings found in a
grotto in Ardeche, a region of south-western France. The photographs
were sent to Project Gutenberg by Jean Clottes, a general curator for
cultural heritage (conservateur general du patrimoine), for everyone to
enjoy them.

Released in August 1997, eBook #1000 was La Divina Commedia (1321) de
Dante Alighieri, in Italian, its original language.

# In 1998

In October 1997, Michael Hart expressed his intention to produce more
ebooks in other languages. In early 1998, there were a few titles in
French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin.

Stendhal and Jules Verne were followed by Edmond Rostand with Cyrano de
Bergerac, published in 1897 and released in Project Gutenberg 100 years
later, in March 1998.

# In 1999

Released in May 1999, eBook #2000 was Don Quijote (1605), by Cervantes,
in Spanish, its original language.

In July 1999, Michael Hart wrote in an email interview: "I am
publishing in one new language per month right now, and will continue
as long as possible."

# In 2000

Released in December 2000, eBook #3000 was A l'ombre des jeunes filles
en fleurs (In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower), vol. 3 (1919), by
Marcel Proust, in French, its original language.

# In 2001

Project Gutenberg Australia was launched in July 2001, and began
producing ebooks in English and in other languages, for example some
volumes in French of A la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost
Time, 1913-27) by Marcel Proust. (The last volumes of Proust's
masterpiece are still copyrighted in the United States, the reason why
they are lacking in Project Gutenberg's main website.) 1,750 ebooks
were available in Project Gutenberg Australia in February 2009.

Released in October 2001, eBook #4000 was The French Immortals Series
(1905), in English. This book is an anthology of short fictions by
authors from the French Academy (Academie francaise): Emile Souvestre,
Pierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet, and
others.

# In 2002

Released in April 2002, eBook #5000 was The Notebooks of Leonardo da
Vinci (early 16th century), as an English translation from Italian, its
original language. Since its release, this ebook has regularly stayed
in the "Top 100" of downloaded ebooks.

# In 2003

The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) was affiliated with
Project Gutenberg in 2003, and became a sister project. Since 1997,
PGCC has been working on gathering collections of ebooks from other
sources, in a number of formats and languages, with 75,000 ebooks in
2010.

# In 2004

In early 2004, there were works in 25 languages in Project Gutenberg.

In February 2004, Michael Hart went off to Europe, with stops in Paris,
France; Brussels, Belgium; and Belgrade, Serbia.

He gave a lecture on February 12, 2004 at the headquarters of UNESCO
(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in
Paris. He chaired a discussion at the French National Assembly on
February 13.

The following week, he addressed the European Parliament, in Brussels.

Then he went to Belgrade to meet with the team of Project Rastko and
support the launching of Project Gutenberg Europe and Distributed
Proofreaders Europe.

Project Rastko, a non-governmental cultural and educational project,
was founded in 1997 in Belgrade as part of the Balkans Cultural Network
Initiative, a regional network for the Balkan peninsula in south-
eastern Europe.

Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) has used the software of
the original Distributed Proofreaders, created in 2000 by Charles
Franks to share the correction of ebooks among many volunteers.

DP Europe has offered a plurilingual interface right from the start,
with its main pages translated into 12 European languages by volunteer
translators as soon as April 2004. The long-term goal was 60 languages,
for the interface to be available in most European languages.

# In 2005

In May 2005, DP Europe finished processing its 100th ebook. These
ebooks were in several languages, as a reflection of European
linguistic diversity. DP Europe has supported Unicode to be able to
proofread ebooks in many languages. 600 ebooks were available in
February 2009.

In July 2005, there were works in 42 languages in Project Gutenberg,
including Sanskrit and the Mayan languages. The seven main languages
were English (with 14,548 ebooks on July 27, 2005), French (577
ebooks), German (349 ebooks), Finnish (218 ebooks), Dutch (130 ebooks),
Spanish (103 ebooks), and Chinese (69 ebooks).

# In 2006

Released in December 2006, eBook #20000 was the audiobook of Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Vingt mille lieues sous les mers,
1869), by Jules Verne,
in its English version.

In December 2006, there were ebooks in 50 languages. The ten main
languages were English (with 17,377 ebooks on December 16, 2006),
French (966 ebooks), German (412 ebooks), Finnish (344 ebooks), Dutch
(244 ebooks), Spanish (140 ebooks), Italian (102 ebooks), Chinese (69
ebooks), Portuguese (68 ebooks), and Tagalog (51 ebooks).

# In 2007

Project Gutenberg Canada (PGC) was launched on July 1st, 2007, on
Canada Day. Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in
December 2007, with 100 ebooks in English, French, and Italian in March
2008, and 250 ebooks in February 2009.

# In 2010

On October 7, 2010, there were works in 59 languages in Project
Gutenberg. The ten  main languages were English (with 28,441 ebooks),
French (1,659 ebooks), German (709 ebooks), Finnish (536 ebooks), Dutch
(496 ebooks), Portuguese (473 ebooks), Chinese (405 ebooks), Spanish
(295 ebooks), Italian (250 ebooks), and Greek (101 ebooks). They were
followed by Latin, Esperanto, Swedish, and Tagalog.

# In 2020, may be

It is hoped machine translation software will be able to convert the
ebooks from one to another of many languages.

In ten years from now, machine translation may be judged 99%
satisfactory - research is active on that front, and software is
quickly improving - allowing for the reading of literary classics in a
choice of many languages.

The machine translated ebooks won't compete with the work of literary
translators and their labor of love during days and months if not
years, but they would allow readers to get the gist of some literary
works that have never been translated so far, or only translated in a
few languages, for commercial reasons.

The output of translation software could then be proofread by human
translators, in a similar way the output of OCR software is proofread
by the volunteers of Distributed Proofreaders.

So, may be, we will see Distributed Translators one day, as a partner
or sister project of Distributed Proofreaders and Project Gutenberg?



EL PROYECTO GUTENBERG Y LOS IDIOMAS [ES]


El Proyecto Gutenberg ofrece libros digitales en ingles en su gran
mayoria, pero el multilingueismo es una de sus prioridades. El frances
es el segundo idioma del proyecto. Las collecciones reunen libros en 60
idiomas - incluso en espanol - en diciembre de 2010.

# En 1990-1994

Al principio los libros digitales estan en ingles. Como el Proyecto
Gutenberg  fue lanzado desde la Universidad de Illinois (Estados
Unidos), con la ayuda de voluntarios de habla inglesa, su proposito
inicial es proporcionar libros a la comunidad anglofona, es decir el
95% de los usuarios del internet a principios de 1990. (Los non
anglofonos representaran el 50% de los usuarios en el verano de 2000,
con un porcentaje que seguira creciendo durante los anos siguientes.)

El Proyecto Gutenberg tambien inspira dos otras bibliotecas digitales
en Europa, el Projekt Runeberg en 1992 para la literatura nordica y el
Projekt Gutenberg-DE en 1994 para la literatura alemana.

El Projekt Runeberg es la primera biblioteca digital sueca de libros
del dominio publico, y un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg. Esta biblioteca
es creada en diciembre de 1992 por Lysator, un club informatico de
estudiantes, en colaboracion con la biblioteca de la Universidad de
Linkoeping (Suecia), para producir y organizar versiones electronicas
gratuitas de obras de literatura nordica (escandinava) clasica. 200
obras estan disponibles en 1998, con una lista de 6.000 autores
nordicos para el desarrollo de las colecciones futuras.

El Projekt Gutenberg-DE es la primera biblioteca digital alemana de
libros del dominio publico, y tambien un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg.
Se pueden leer decenas de textos en linea en 1998, con una pagina web
para textos cortos y varias paginas web - uno por capitulo - para obras
mas largas. Una lista alfabetica de autores y de titulos esta
disponible en el sitio, con una breve biografia y bibliografia para
cada autor.

# En 1997

El frances llego a ser la segunda lengua del Proyecto Gutenberg, y
sigue siendolo en 2010.

Los primeros libros en frances son seis obras de Stendhal y dos obras
de Jules Verne, todas disponibles a principios de 1997.

Las dos novelas de Jules Verne son: De la terre a la lune (1865) y Le
tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).

En aquella fecha, tres novelas de Jules Verne ya estan disponibles en
ingles: From the Earth to the Moon (titulo original: De la terre a la
lune), disponible en  septiembre de 1993; Around the World in 80 Days
(titulo original: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours), disponible
en enero de 1994; y 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (titulo original:
Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1869-1870), disponible en septiembre
de 1994.

Desde la publicacion de estos primeros libros digitales, Jules Verne
siempre ha sido parte de los autores mas descargados. Era el undecimo
autor en el "Top 20 de autores" mas descargados en diciembre de 1999.
Era el sexto autor en el "Top 100 de autores" mas descargados en los
ultimos treinta dias en la fecha del 15 de noviembre de 2010.

En agosto de 1997, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea el eBook #1000,
La Divina Commedia (La Divina Comedia) de Dante Alighieri (publicada en
1321), en italiano, su idioma original.

# En 1998-2000

En octubre de 1997, Michael Hart anuncia su intencion de aumentar la
produccion de libros en otros idiomas que el ingles. A principios de
1998, el catalogo incluye obras en aleman, espanol, frances, italiano y
latin.

Disponible en mayo de 1999, el eBook #2000 es Don Quijote (1605), en
castellano, su idioma original.

En julio de 1999, Michael escribe en una entrevista por correo
electronico: "Ahora anado un nuevo idioma cada mes, y voy a seguir
haciendolo todo el tiempo sea posible."

Disponible en diciembre de 2000, el eBook #3000 es el tercer volumen de
A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (A la sombra de las muchachas en
flor, 1919) de Marcel Proust, en frances, su idioma original.

# En 2001

El Proyecto Gutenberg Australia - creado en julio de 2001 - inaugura la
produccion de libros digitales en ingles y en otros idiomas, por
ejemplo algunos volumenes en frances de A la recherche du temps perdu
(En busca del tiempo perdido, 1913-1927) de Marcel Proust. (Los ultimos
volumenes todavia estan bajo copyright en los Estados Unidos, y no
estan disponibles en el Proyecto Gutenberg). El Proyecto Gutenberg
Australia cuenta con 1.750 ebooks en febrero de 2009.

Disponible en octubre de 2001, el eBook #4000 es The French Immortals

puesta en linea, este ebook  figura con regularidad en el "Top 100" de
los libros mas descargados.

# En 2003

El Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) - lanzado en 1997 para
reunir en un punto de acceso unico colecciones de otras bibliotecas -
esta afiliado oficialmente al Proyecto Gutenberg en 2003. Este sitio
ofrece mas de 75.000 ebooks en varios formatos e idiomas en noviembre
de 2010.

# En 2004

A principios de 2004, 25 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto
Gutenberg.

En febrero de 2004, Michael Hart vuela a Europa con escalas en Bruselas
(Belgica), Paris (Francia) y Belgrado (Serbia). El 12 de febrero de
2004 da una conferencia en la sede de la UNESCO (Organizacion de las
Naciones Unidas para la Educacion, la Ciencia y la Cultura) en Paris.
Al dia siguiente, anima un debate en la Asamblea Nacional Francesa. La
semana siguiente hace un discurso ante el Parlamento Europeo en
Bruselas.

Despues Michael se va a reune con el equipo del Proyecto Rastko en
Belgrado para apoyar el lanzamiento del Proyecto Gutenberg Europa y de
Distributed Proofreaders Europa. El Proyecto Rastko es una organizacion
no gubernamental  con vocacion cultural y educativa fundada en 1997
como parte de una red cultural regional en la Peninsula de los
Balcanes, en el sureste de Europa.

Distributed Proofreaders Europa (DP Europa) utiliza el software y la
interfaz de Distributed Proofreaders, un sitio creado en octubre de
2000 por Charles Franks para repartir la revision de los libros
digitales entre muchos voluntarios.

Desde sus inicios, DP Europe es un sitio plurilinguee que toma en cuenta
las mayores lenguas nacionales europeas. Traducido por traductores
voluntarios, el sitio de DP Europa esta disponible en doce idiomas en
abril de 2004, con la intencion de proponer la interfaz en sesenta
idiomas, es decir todos los (mayores) idiomas europeos.

En mayo de 2005, DP Europa completa la correccion de su centesimo libro
digital. Estos libros estan en varios idiomas con el fin de reflejar la
diversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa. La codificacion
utilizada es el Unicode para corregir libros en  muchos idiomas. DP
Europa cuenta con 600 libros en febrero de 2009.

# En 2005

En julio de 2005, 42 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto
Gutenberg, incluyendo el sanscrito y las lenguas mayas. Los siete
principales idiomas son el ingles (con 14.548 ebooks el 27 de julio
2005), el frances (577 ebooks), en aleman (349 ebooks), el finlandes

En diciembre de 2006, 50 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto
Gutenberg. Los diez principales idiomas son el ingles (con 17.377
ebooks el 16 de diciembre 2006), el frances (966 ebooks), el aleman
(412 ebooks), el finlandes (344 ebooks), el holandes (244 ebooks), el
espanol (140 ebooks), el italiano (102 ebooks), el chino (69 ebooks),
el portugues (68 ebooks) y el tagalo (51 ebooks).

# En 2007

El Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC) es creado el 1 de julio de 2007, el
dia de la fiesta nacional de Canada. Distributed Proofreaders Canada
(DPC) inicia su produccion de libros en diciembre de 2007, con 100
libros en ingles, en frances y en italiano disponibles en marzo de
2008, y 250 libros disponibles en febrero de 2009.

# En 2010

En octubre de 2010, 59 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto

el italiano (250 ebooks) y el griego (101 ebooks). Estos idiomas son
seguidos por el latin, el esperanto, el sueco y el tagalo.

# En 2020, quizas

Quizas podamos beneficiar en el futuro de la traduccion inmediata de
estos libros a una gran variedad de idiomas, a traves de un software de
traduccion automatica.

En diez anos, la traduccion automatica podria haber logrado un
porcentaje de fiabilidad del 99% - la investigacion es muy activa en
este campo, y los softwares son cada vez mejores - con capacidad de
leer obras literarias en un gran numero de idiomas.

Los libros traducidos por un software de traduccion automatica no van a
competir con el trabajo de los traductores literarios y sus esfuerzos
talentosos durante dias y meses si no anos. Pero van a permitir al
lector captar lo esencial de obras literarias nunca traducidas, o
traducidas solo a unos pocos idiomas por razones comerciales.

Un libro traducido por un software de traduccion podra a continuacion
ser corregido por traductores (seres humanos) mediante el uso de una
interfaz similar a la que utilizan ahora los voluntarios de Distributed
Proofreaders para la correccion de un libro digital producido por un
software de OCR (reconocimiento optico de caracteres).

Asi pues, uno empieza a sonar con Distributed Translators para
compartir la revision de las traducciones, como un socio de Distributed
Proofreaders y del Proyecto Gutenberg.



LE PROJET GUTENBERG ET LES LANGUES [FR]


Le Projet Gutenberg propose essentiellement des livres numeriques en
anglais, mais le multilinguisme est l'une de ses priorites. Le francais
est la deuxieme langue du projet. Soixante langues sont representees en
decembre 2010.

# En 1990-1994

A l'origine, les livres numeriques sont en anglais. Comme le Projet
Gutenberg est lance a partir de l'Universite de l'Illinois (Etats-
Unis), avec l'aide de volontaires anglophones, son but premier est de
procurer des livres a la communaute anglophone, a savoir 95% des
usagers de l'internet au debut des annees 1990. (Les usagers non
anglophones atteignent les 50% en ete 2000, avec un pourcentage qui
augmente regulierement ensuite.)

Le Projet Gutenberg inspire aussi d'autres bibliotheques numeriques
ailleurs, a savoir le Projekt Runeberg pour la litterature nordique
(scandinave) en 1992 et le Projekt Gutenberg-DE pour la litterature
allemande en 1994.

Le Projekt Runeberg est la premiere bibliotheque numerique suedoise de
livres du domaine public, et un partenaire du Projet Gutenberg. Elle
est creee en decembre 1992 par Lysator, un club informatique
d'etudiants, en collaboration avec la bibliotheque de l'Universite de
Linkoeping (Suede), pour produire et organiser des versions
electroniques gratuites de la litterature nordique classique. 200
oeuvres sont disponibles en 1998, avec une liste de 6.000 auteurs
nordiques en tant qu'outil de developpement des collections.

Projekt Gutenberg-DE est la premiere bibliotheque numerique allemande
de livres du domaine public, et egalement un partenaire du Projet
Gutenberg. Plusieurs dizaines de textes peuvent etre lus en ligne en
1998, avec une page web pour les textes courts et plusieurs pages - une
par chapitre - pour les oeuvres plus longues. Une liste alphabetique
d'auteurs et de titres est egalement disponible, ainsi qu'une courte
biographie et bibliographie pour chaque auteur.

# En 1997

Le francais fut la deuxieme langue du Projet Gutenberg, et c'est
toujours le cas en 2010.

Les premiers livres disponibles en francais sont six oeuvres de
Stendhal et deux oeuvres de Jules Verne, toutes mises en ligne debut
1997.

Les six oeuvres de Stendhal sont quatre recits: Les Cenci (publie en
1837), Vittoria Accoramboni (1837), La Duchesse de Palliano (1838) et
L'Abbesse de Castro (1839) - tous recits publies dans La revue des deux
mondes - et deux romans: Le Rouge et le Noir (1830) et La Chartreuse de
Parme (1839).

Les deux romans de Jules Verne sont: De la terre a la lune (1865) et Le
tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).

A cette date, trois romans de Jules Verne sont deja disponibles en
anglais: From the Earth to the Moon (titre original: De la terre a la
lune), disponible en  septembre 1993; Around the World in 80 Days
(titre original: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours), disponible
en janvier 1994; et 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (titre original:
Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1869-1870), disponible en septembre
1994.

Depuis la parution de ces premiers titres, Jules Verne a toujours fait
partie des auteurs les plus telecharges, a la onzieme place dans le
"Top 20" du Projet Gutenberg en decembre 1999 et a la sixieme place
dans le "Top 100" des auteurs les plus telecharges durant les trente
derniers jours a la date du 6 novembre 2010.

A titre anecdotique, le premier recueil d'images disponible dans le
Projet Gutenberg toutes langues confondues est French Cave Paintings
(Peintures des cavernes en France), mis en ligne des avril 1995 (eBook
#249), avec une version XHTML ajoutee en novembre 2000. Il s'agit de
quatre photos de peintures paleolithiques retrouvees dans une grotte de
l'Ardeche, un departement du sud-ouest de la France. Ces photos, sous
copyright, ont ete mises a la disposition du Projet Gutenberg par Jean
Clottes, conservateur general du patrimoine, pour pouvoir etre

Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) est calque sur le site
original de Distributed Proofreaders, un site cree en octobre 2000 par
Charles Franks pour partager la correction des livres entre de nombreux
volontaires.

Des ses debuts, DP Europe est un site plurilingue, avec prise en compte
des principales langues nationales europeennes. Grace a des traducteurs
volontaires, le site de DP Europe est disponible en douze langues des
avril 2004. L'objectif a long terme est une interface disponible en
soixante langues, a savoir la plupart des langues europeennes.

# En 2005

En mai 2005, DP Europe termine la correction de son centieme livre. Ces
livres sont en plusieurs langues, en tant que reflet de la diversite
des langues en Europe. L'encodage utilise est l'Unicode, pour pouvoir
traiter des livres dans de nombreuses langues. 600 livres sont
disponibles en fevrier 2009.

En juillet 2005, 42 langues sont representees dans le Projet Gutenberg,
y compris le sanscrit et les langues mayas. Les sept langues
principales sont l'anglais (avec 14.548 ebooks le 27 juillet 2005), le
francais (577 ebooks),  l'allemand (349 ebooks), le finnois (218

Gutenberg. Les dix langues principales sont l'anglais (avec 17.377
ebooks le 16 decembre 2006),  le francais (966 ebooks), l'allemand (412
ebooks), le finnois (344 ebooks), le neerlandais (244 ebooks),
l'espagnol (140 ebooks), l'italien (102 ebooks), le chinois (69
ebooks), le portugais (68 ebooks) et le tagalog (51 ebooks).

# En 2007

Project Gutenberg Canada (PGC) est lance le 1er juillet 2007, le jour
de la fete nationale au Canada. Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC)
debute ses activites en decembre 2007, avec 100 livres numeriques en
anglais, en francais et en italien en mars 2008, et 250 livres en
fevrier 2009.

# En 2010

En novembre 2010, 60 langues sont representees dans le Projet
Gutenberg. Les dix langues principales sont l'anglais (avec 28.666
ebooks le 6 novembre 2010),  le francais (1.672 ebooks), l'allemand
(715 ebooks), le finnois (542 ebooks), le neerlandais (498 ebooks), le
portugais (474 ebooks), le chinois (405 ebooks), l'espagnol (297
ebooks), l'italien (253 ebooks) et le grec (107 ebooks). Ces langues
sont suivies du latin, de l'esperanto, du suedois et du tagalog.

# En 2020, peut-etre

Il est possible qu'on puisse beneficier un jour de la traduction
immediate de ces livres dans un vaste choix de langues, par le biais
d'un logiciel de traduction automatique.

Dans dix ans, la traduction automatique pourrait avoir atteint un taux
de fiabilite de l'ordre de 99% - la recherche est tres active dans ce
domaine, avec des logiciels de plus en plus performants - avec
possibilite de lire des oeuvres litteraires dans un grand nombre de
langues.

Les livres traduits par le biais d'un logiciel de traduction
automatique ne rivaliseront certainement pas avec le travail des
traducteurs litteraires et leurs efforts talentueux pendant des jours
et des mois sinon des annees. Mais ils permettraient au lecteur une
premiere approche d'oeuvres litteraires jamais traduites jusqu'ici, ou
traduites seulement dans quelques langues, pour des raisons
commerciales.

Le texte d'un livre traduit (issu d'un logiciel de traduction) pourrait
ensuite etre corrige par des traducteurs (des etres humains, pas des
logiciels), en utilisant une interface semblable a celle utilisee
actuellement pour la correction du texte d'un livre (issu d'un logiciel
OCR) par les volontaires de Distributed Proofreaders.

On se prend ainsi a rever a un Distributed Translators pour partager la
revision des traductions, Distributed Translators pouvant etre un
organisme partenaire de Distributed Proofreaders et du Projet
Gutenberg.



DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS IS TEN YEARS OLD [EN]


Project Gutenberg got its first boost with the invention of the web in
1990, and its second boost with the creation of Distributed
Proofreaders in 2000, to share the proofreading of digitized books
between many volunteers. Volunteers choose a book currently processed
through the site to proofread a given page, or several pages, as they
wish. One page per day is a great goal. It doesn't seem much, but with
hundreds of volunteers it really adds up.

# A website launched in 2000

Distributed Proofreaders (DP) was founded in October 2000 by Charles
Franks to support the digitization of public domain books. From the
website one can access a program that allows several proofreaders to be
working on the same book at the same time, each proofreading on
different pages. The goal is to all work together - from any region in
the world - to significantly speed up the proofreading process.

Originally conceived to assist Project Gutenberg (PG), Distributed
Proofreaders is now the main source of PG ebooks. In 2002, DP became an
official PG site. In May 2006, DP became a separate legal entity and
continues to maintain a strong relationship with PG.

Distributed Proofreaders counted 3,000 ebooks "preserved for the world"
in February 2004, 5,000 ebooks in October 2004, 7,000 ebooks in May
2005, 10,000 ebooks in December 2006, 11,950 ebooks in January 2008,
and 18,848 ebooks on 15 October 2010. Production was 196 titles in
October 2010.

# How all this works

Volunteers register and receive detailed instructions. For example,
words in bold, italic or underlined, or footnotes are always treated
the same way for any ebook. A discussion forum allows them to ask
questions or seek help at any time.

Each time proofreaders go to the website, they choose the book they
want. One page of the book appears in two forms side by side: the
scanned image of one page, and the text from that image as produced by
OCR software. The proofreader can easily compare both versions, note
the differences, and fix them. OCR is usually 99% accurate, which makes
for about 10 corrections a page. The proofreader saves the page as it
is completed, and then can either stop work or do another.

The books are proofread twice, and the second time only by experienced
proofreaders.

All the pages of the book are then formatted, combined and assembled by
post-processors to make an ebook.

A project manager oversees the progress of a particular book through
its different steps on the website.

The ebook is now ready to be released in Project Gutenberg with an
index entry (title, subtitle, author, ebook number, and character set)
for the database. Catalogers go on with the cataloguing process
(author's dates of birth and death, Library of Congress classification,
etc.) after the release.

# Everyone is welcome

New volunteers are most welcome, and will be guided by experienced
volunteers for their first steps. There is a lot to do, and everyone is
welcome.

As stated on DP's website in 2005, "Remember that there is no
commitment expected on this site. Proofread as often or as seldom as
you like, and as many or as few pages as you like. We encourage people
to do 'a page a day', but it's entirely up to you! We hope you will
join us in our mission of 'preserving the literary history of the world
in a freely available form for everyone to use'."

# Distributed Proofreaders Europe

Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) was launched in  early 2004
by Project Rastko in Belgrade, Serbia, as well as Project Gutenberg
Europe. DP Europe uses the software of the original Distributed
Proofreaders.

Since its beginning, DP Europe has been a multilingual website, with
its main pages translated into the main national European languages by
volunteer translators. DP Europe was available in 12 languages as early
as April 2004. The long-term goal is 60 languages representing most
European languages.

In May 2005, DP Europe finished processing its 100th ebook. Ebooks were
in several languages to reflect European linguistic diversity. 600
ebooks were ready in February 2009, and 732 ebooks on 15 October 2010.

DP Europe supports Unicode to be able to proofread ebooks in numerous
languages. Unicode is an encoding system created in 1991 that gives a
unique number for every character in any language. Unicode is meant to
replace ASCII, an encoding system dating back from 1968 that can only
handle English and Latin in its "original" version, and a few European
languages with accents in its "extended" version. In 2008, half of the
files available on the internet were Unicode files.

# Distributed Proofreaders Canada

Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in December
2007, to digitize and proofread ebooks for Project Gutenberg Canada
(PGC), founded on July 1st, 2007, on Canada Day, by Michael Shepard and
David Jones. There were 100 ebooks in March 2008, in English, French
and Italian. 250 ebooks were available in February 2009, and 427 books
on October 15, 2010.

# A few numbers

= Over 33,000 high-quality proofread ebooks in Project Gutenberg, in
several languages. (Quality more than quantity is what really matters
to the reader, believe me.)

= 18,961 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders (the original
website) on November 1st, 2010, since its creation in October 2000,
with 2,352 active volunteers in October 2010.

= 739 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders Europe on November
1st, 2010, since its creation on January 2004.

= 433 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders Canada on November
1st, 2010, since its creation in December 2007, with 127 active
volunteers in October 2010.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS TIENE 10 ANOS [ES]


El Proyecto Gutenberg cobra nuevo aliento y alcanza una difusion
internacional con la aparicion de la web en 1990, y luego con la
creacion de Distributed Proofreaders (Correctores Distribuidos) en
2000, cuya meta es compartir la revision de los libros entre centenares
de voluntarios. Los voluntarios eligen un libro digital que se esta
procesando en el sitio para releer y corregir determinada pagina, o
algunas paginas, como quieran. A titulo indicativo, se aconseja
corregir una pagina al dia. Representa poco tiempo en un dia, pero
mucho para el proyecto. Una pagina multiplicada por cientos de
voluntarios representa un volumen considerable.

# Un sitio lanzado en 2000

Distributed Proofreaders es concebido en octubre de 2000 por Charles
Franks para  contribuir a la digitalizacion de los libros del dominio
publico. La interfaz del sitio web da acceso a un software que permite
a varios voluntarios trabajar simultaneamente en el mismo libro, cada
uno corrigiendo diferentes paginas. El objetivo es que todos trabajen
juntos - desde cualquier lugar del mundo - para acelerar
significativamente el proceso de revision de los libros.

Originalmente destinado a ayudar el Proyecto Gutenberg en su tarea,
Distributed Proofreaders se convierte rapidamente en la principal
fuente de sus ebooks. Despues de afiliarse con el Proyecto Gutenberg en
2002, Distributed Proofreaders se convierte en una entidad
independiente en mayo de 2006, aunque manteniendo una estrecha relacion
con este.

Distributed Proofreaders contabiliza 3.000 libros digitalizados y
corregidos en febrero de 2004, 5.000 libros en octubre de 2004, 7.000
libros en mayo de 2005, 10.000 libros en diciembre de 2006, 11.950
libros en enero de 2008 y 19.059 libros el 16 de noviembre de 2010. La
produccion es de 196 ebooks en octubre de 2010.

# La organizacion practica del procesamiento

El nuevo voluntario empieza por registrarse. Recibe instrucciones
detalladas, por ejemplo como tratar las partes en negrita, en cursiva o
subrayadas, o las notas, que se tratan todas de la misma manera. Un
foro permite formular preguntas y pedir ayuda en cualquier momento.

Cuando el voluntario inicia una sesion en el sitio, elige un libro a
partir de  una lista dada. Una pagina del libro elegido aparece en dos
versiones: por una parte la imagen digitalizada de la pagina, por otra
el texto resultante de esta imagen, producido por un software de OCR
(reconocimiento optico de caracteres). El voluntario compara las dos
versiones y corrige las diferencias. Un software de OCR tiene una
precision del 99%, lo que representa un promedio de diez errores a
corregir por pagina. Luego el voluntario salva la pagina y puede cesar
su relectura o bien optar por la correccion de otra pagina.

Todos los libros son revisados dos veces, y la segunda vez solo por
correctores experimentados.

Otros voluntarios llamados "post-procesadores" ("post-processors" en
ingles) formatean y montan las paginas corregidas, de acuerdo con
normas precisas, para obtener un ebook.

Durante todo el proceso, un jefe de proyecto (llamado "project manager"
en ingles) sigue el tratamiento de un libro dado para garantizar el
buen funcionamiento del proceso.

A continuacion se pone en linea el ebook en el Proyecto Gutenberg
despues de su indexacion (titulo, subtitulo, autor, numero del ebook y
formato de codificacion) por voluntarios indizadores. Catalogadores
voluntarios se encargan  luego de la catalogacion de este libro (fechas
de nacimiento y  muerte del autor, clasificacion de la Biblioteca del
Congreso, etc.).

# Calquier participacion es bienvenida

Los nuevos voluntarios son bienvenidos, en cualquier pais y para
cualquier idioma, y seran guiados por voluntarios experimentados para
sus primeros pasos como revisores. La tarea es inmensa, y cualquier
ayuda es muy apreciada.

Como se indica en el sitio web en 2005, "DP no espera su compromiso
incondicional. Usted puede revisar textos todas las veces que quiera, y
el numero de paginas que desee. Alentamos a la gente a corregir una
pagina por dia, pero usted esta totalmente libre de hacer lo que le
gusta. Esperamos que usted se una a nuestra mision de 'preservar la
literatura mundial en una version gratuita y disponible para todos'."

# Distributed Proofreaders Europa

Distributed Proofreaders Europa (DP Europa) - copiado a partir del
sitio y del software original de Distributed Proofreaders - se lanza en
enero de 2004 para gestionar la revision de los libros del Proyecto
Gutenberg Europa, a iniciativa del Proyecto Rastko, basado en Belgrado
(Serbia).

Desde sus inicios, DP Europa es un sitio web multilinguee, traducido por
voluntarios a los grandes idiomas nacionales europeos, y disponible en
doce idiomas en abril de 2004. El objetivo a largo plazo es una
interfaz en sesenta idiomas para tener en cuenta todas las (mayores)
lenguas europeas.

Los cien primeros libros estan disponibles en abril de 2005. Estos
libros estan en varios idiomas - de los cuales el espanol - con el fin
de reflejar la diversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa. DP
Europa contabiliza 600 libros en febrero de 2009, y 741 libros el 16 de
noviembre de 2010.

DP Europa utiliza el Unicode para poder procesar libros en varios
idiomas. Unicode es un sistema de codificacion creado en 1991, que
asigna un codigo unico para cada caracter de todos los idiomas del
planeta. Se sustituye poco a poco al ASCII, un sistema de codificacion
que data de 1968 y que solo puede procesar el ingles y el latin en su
version "original", y algunos idiomas europeos con acentos en su
version "extendida". En 2008, 50% de los archivos disponibles en el
internet estan codificados en Unicode.

# Distributed Proofreaders Canada

Distributed Proofreaders Canada (PGC) se lanza en diciembre de 2007
para la produccion de los ebooks del Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC),
creado el 1 de julio de 2007, dia de la fiesta nacional, a instigacion
de Michael Shepard y David Jones. Los cien primeros libros estan
disponibles en marzo de 2008, con libros en ingles, en frances y en
italiano. 250 libros estan disponibles en febrero de 2009, y 441 libros
el 16 de noviembre de 2010.

# Algunas cifras

= Mas de 33.000 ebooks en el Proyecto Gutenberg, todos revisados dos
veces, y en varios idiomas. El objetivo es mas la calidad que la
cantidad.

= 19.059 ebooks procesados por Distributed Proofreaders (el sitio
original, basado en los Estados Unidos) el 16 de noviembre de 2010,
desde su lanzamiento en octubre de 2000, y 2.352 voluntarios activos
durante el mes de octubre de 2010.

= 741 ebooks procesados por Distributed Proofreaders Europa el 16 de
noviembre de 2010, desde su lanzamiento en enero de 2004.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS A DIX ANS [FR]


Le Projet Gutenberg trouve un second souffle et un rayonnement
international avec l'apparition du web en 1990 puis la creation de
Distributed Proofreaders en 2000, pour partager la relecture des livres
entre des centaines de volontaires. Les volontaires choisissent un
livre en cours de traitement pour relire et corriger une page donnee,
ou bien plusieurs. A titre indicatif, il est conseille de relire une
page par jour. C'est peu de temps sur une journee, et c'est beaucoup
pour le projet. Une page multipliee par des centaines de volontaires
represente un chiffre considerable.

# Un site lance en 2000

Distributed Proofreaders est concu en octobre 2000 par Charles Franks
pour contribuer a la numerisation des livres du domaine public. A
partir du site web, on accede a un logiciel permettant a plusieurs
correcteurs de travailler simultanement au meme livre, chacun
travaillant sur des pages differentes, le but etant bien sur de
travailler ensemble - de n'importe quelle region du monde - pour
accelerer de maniere sensible le processus de revision des livres.

Cense a l'origine aider le Projet Gutenberg dans sa tache, Distributed
Proofreaders devient rapidement la principale source des livres du
Projet Gutenberg. Apres avoir ete affilie au Projet Gutenberg en 2002,
il devient une entite independante en mai 2006, tout en conservant des
liens etroits avec le Projet Gutenberg.

Distributed Proofreaders comptabilise 3.000 livres numerises et
corriges en fevrier 2004, 5.000 livres en octobre 2004, 7.000 livres en
mai 2005, 10.000 livres en decembre 2006, 11.950 livres en janvier 2008
et 18.848 livres le 15 octobre 2010. La production etait de 196 livres
en octobre 2010.

# Comment cela se passe, pratiquement

Le volontaire relecteur commence par s'inscrire. Il recoit des
directives detaillees. Ces directives concernent par exemple les
parties en gras, en italique et soulignees, ou les notes, qui sont
toutes traitees de la meme maniere. Un forum permet de poser des
questions et de demander de l'aide a tout moment.

Quand le relecteur se connecte au site, il selectionne le livre de son
choix a partir d'une liste donnee. Une page du livre choisi apparait
simultanement dans deux versions: d'une part l'image scannee, d'autre
part le texte issu de cette image, produit par un logiciel OCR. Le
relecteur compare les deux versions et corrige les differences. Un
logiciel OCR etant fiable a 99%, cela represente une moyenne de dix
erreurs a corriger par page. Le relecteur sauvegarde ensuite la page,
et peut ensuite soit cesser le travail, soit opter pour la correction
d'une autre page.

Tous les livres sont relus et corriges deux fois de suite et, la
deuxieme fois, uniquement par des correcteurs experimentes.

Les pages corrigees sont ensuite formatees et assemblees selon des
regles precises par d'autres volontaires (appeles "post-processors")
pour obtenir un ebook.

Durant la totalite du processus, le traitement d'un livre donne est
suivi par un responsable (appele "project manager"), qui s'assure du
bon deroulement des operations.

Apres la mise en forme suit la mise en ligne sur le Projet Gutenberg,
avec indexation du livre (titre, sous-titre, auteur, numero de l'ebook
et format d'encodage) par d'autres volontaires puis catalogage
complementaire (dates de naissance et mort de l'auteur, classification
de la Library of Congress, etc.) ensuite.

# Toute participation est bienvenue

De nouveaux volontaires sont bienvenus, dans tout pays et pour toute
langue, y compris pour les livres en francais, et seront guides par des
volontaires experimentes pour leurs premiers pas en tant que reviseurs.
La tache est immense, et toute aide est tres appreciee.

Comme indique sur le site en 2005, "DP ne s'attend pas a un engagement
inconditionnel de votre part. Corrigez des textes aussi souvent que
vous le voulez, et le nombre de pages que vous voulez. Nous
encourageons les gens a corriger une page par jour, mais vous etes tout
a fait libre de faire ce qui vous plait. Nous esperons que vous vous
joindrez a notre mission de "preserver la litterature mondiale dans une
version gratuite et disponible pour tous"."

# Distributed Proofreaders Europe

Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) - calque sur le site
original de Distributed Proofreaders, dont il utilise le logiciel - est
lance en janvier 2004 pour gerer la relecture partagee du Projet
Gutenberg Europe, sous l'egide du Projet Rastko a Belgrade (Serbie).

Des ses debuts, DP Europe est un site multilingue. Ses pages
principales sont traduites dans les grandes langues nationales
europeennes par des traducteurs volontaires. Le site de DP Europe est
disponible en douze langues des le mois d'avril 2004. L'objectif a long
terme est soixante langues, avec prise en compte de la plupart des
langues europeennes.

Cent livres numerises et corriges sont disponibles en mai 2005. Les
livres sont en plusieurs langues pour refleter la diversite
linguistique prevalant en Europe. 600 livres sont prets en fevrier 2009
et 732 livres le 15 octobre 2010.

DP Europe utilise l'Unicode pour pouvoir traiter des livres dans un
grand nombre de langues. L'Unicode, cree en 1991, est un systeme
d'encodage qui attribue un code unique a chaque caractere pour toutes
les langues de la planete, et qui remplace peu a peu l'ASCII, un
systeme d'encodage datant de 1968 et qui ne peut traiter que l'anglais

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be
renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one
owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission
and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the
General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the
PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a
registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks,
unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything
for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may
use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative
works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and
printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public
domain eBooks. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license,
especially commercial redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
