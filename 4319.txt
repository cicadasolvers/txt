Foreword

        This book is based on an ancient manuscript known as MS Pepys 2498 of
which one copy is known to exist and is kept at Cambridge University Library
in England. The original source of MS Pepys 2498 (referred to as the Pepys
Gospel or the Pepys Gospel Harmony) is unknown but some scholars have
theorized that it may be as old as Christianity itself.

        One of the more interesting conclusions concerning Jesus based on the
Pepys Gospel Harmony (PGH) sequence is that Jesus was a North Palestinian
Essene associated with the Damascus Covenant found at Qumran in Palestine and
Genizah in Egypt. Furthermore, it has been proposed that Jesus held the
office of  Messiah defined in the Damascus Covenant and His goal as well as
that of the other Damascus Covenant Essenes was to convert the Pharisaical
Jews of Judea which they viewed as the lost sheep of Israel to the Essene
sect of Judaism. The sequence of events in the gospels as depicted in the PGH
shows John the Baptist and Jesus converting Judean Jews through baptism in
the wilderness of Judea. Jesus has an altercation at the temple in Jerusalem
and John is arrested. After John's arrest, Jesus heads north all the way to
Capernaum where he gathers followers numbering in the thousands. After John's
death, Jesus makes a final journey to Jerusalem and once more he and his
followers from Northern Palestine convert Judean Jews. The Pharisaical
leaders of the Judean Jews plot to kill Jesus and put an end to His teaching.
        Thus, the PGH sequence of the canonical gospels depicts what some
scholars believe to have been a sectarian struggle between the Essenes who
adhered to the Damascus Covenant in Northern Palestine and the Pharisaical
Jews in Judea for religious leadership of all Israelites. The Pharisaical
Jews in Judea were looking for a Messiah to vanquish their enemies, Rome and
the Herodians, and therefore rejected Jesus as their Messiah. Whereas, the
Essenes were looking for a Messiah to vanquish their enemies, death, poverty,
disease and infirmity, and therefore hailed Jesus as their Messiah.

Below are some important academic notes concerning the PGH sequence of the
gospels:

        The PGH mentions the city of Gerasa which was an ancient city in
Palestine which was destroyed by the 10th Roman legion Firensis in AD 70.
Only the very oldest existing manuscripts of the  canonical gospels mention
the city of Gerasa while later manuscripts refer to the area as the land of
the Gerasenes. Thus the author of the original source of the PGH may have
lived prior to AD 70.

        The sequence of the PGH also parallels many aspects of the theoretical
"Q" text. The Greek texts of Matthew and Luke in some areas are letter for
letter matches which have led some scholars to theorize that at one time a
single text "Q" was formed from an early form of Matthew and of Luke and then
later portions of our modern forms of Matthew and Luke were copied from this
single gospel text. Additionally, in the modern text of Luke the "Parable of
the Lamp" occurs in both Chapter 8 and Chapter 11. It has been theorized that
an early text that contained Luke had only one "Parable of the Lamp" and that
the parable was either cut in half or duplicated in our modern texts. The PGH
sequence combines portions of Luke Ch. 8 and 11 and only has a single account
of the "Parable of the Lamp" just as some scholars have theorized would've
existed in the single gospel forerunner of the modern text of Luke.

        Scholars have also theorized that the "Q" text would've been
constructed into categories and composed of lists such as a list of parables.
This idea was formulated in part based on the gospel of Thomas found at Nag
Hammadi. The PGH does form the gospel account into categories or groupings
and there are two major groupings of parables in its sequence just as
theorized for the "Q" text.

        The event sequence of the PGH also enhances the account of the four
gospels. The sequence produces cause and effect relationships between events
and the interactions of various individuals with each other and with Jesus.
For instance, The PGH sequence contains both Mary Magdalene's conversion and
subsequent discipleship (this is in the modern gospel texts but is somewhat
obscured due to their non-chronological sequence). Thus Mary Magdalene plays
a major role in the account of Jesus which is implied by many ancient sources
such as the gospel of Thomas but not highlighted by the canonical gospels in
their present sequence. The same is true for the significance of John the
Baptist in Jesus' ministry. In the PGH sequence, John the Baptist is
portrayed as an important ally of Jesus' ministry and his arrest and later
death are both pivotal moments in Jesus ministry as portrayed by the PGH
sequence. The importance of John the Baptist in the ministry of Jesus is
implied by many ancient sources and that importance is vividly depicted in
Jesus' ministry using the PGH sequence of the canonical gospels.

        Moreover, the PGH is the only manuscript in existence which depicts an
error free chronological sequence for the events in the life of Jesus as
portrayed in the four canonical gospels. The four canonical gospels make no
claim to being written in chronological sequence. There are
historical/traditional accounts that indicate that the four canonical gospels
were not written in chronological order. For instance, Papias (AD 135)
indicated that Mark was not in any particular order. An engineered
reconstruction of the chronological order of the gospels indicates that while
several sequences are possible -- the sequence of the modern gospels is not
in chronological order. For instance, the passage in Mark 3:13-19 not only
precedes the passage in Mark 3:20-31 by over a dozen events but in fact
several passages in Mark actually occur between Mark 3:13-19 and Mark 3:20-
31.

        Also, while there have been many modern attempts to reconstruct the
sequence of the events of Jesus life as narrated in the four canonical
gospels none of these reconstructions has as many parallels to the
theoretical "Q" text as the PGH. Furthermore the theory for the "Q" text was
first proposed in the 1800's and the PGH manuscript predates the "Q" text
theory by 400 years. Thus the best candidate to date for the "Q" text
sequence is the PGH manuscript.

        More importantly, the best manuscript for a chronological depiction of
the actual sequence of events in the life of Jesus is The Pepys Gospel
Harmony MS 2498.

The biblical text for this book is from The Common Edition of the New
Testament by T. E. Clontz and I would like to thank my brother for allowing
me to use his book.

Many of the section headings for this book come from The Pepysian Gospel
Harmony, 1922 Oxford edition; Margery Goates, Editor. I am also deeply
indebted to Margery Goates for her invaluable analytical summary of the Pepys
Gospel Harmony. Her analytical summary of the entire work showing the
parallel passages from the canonical gospels made this book possible.

I would also like to thank Yuri Kuchinsky -- author of The Magdalene Gospel
and the moderator for loisy@yahoogroups.com, an email group devoted in part
to discussing the Pepys Gospel Harmony. Yuri's herculean efforts in
maintaining a web site for the Pepys Gospel Harmony first brought my
attention to the existence of this priceless manuscript and the marvels of
its contents.

And finally, I would like to thank the unknown author of the Pepysian Gospel
Harmony MS 2498 for bringing me joy.

We are not cast on the ground,
        that have been recognized by so great highness.
We are not the offspring of mortality,
        afterward to be dissolved by time.
We are not a product of motion,
        made to be again destroyed by itself.
We are not things of earthly birth,
        ending again therein.

We belong to a greatness unto which we aspire,
        of which we are the property,
        and peradventure to a greatness
        that hath mercy upon us.

We belong to the Light,
        by whom we have left the darkness;
To the Eternal,
        by whom we have escaped the bonds of the temporal.






Part 1 - IN THE BEGINNING

1.10    The Gospel

LK 1:1-4

        1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the
things which have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were
delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and
ministers of the word, 3 it seemed good to me also, having carefully
investigated all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly
account, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the
certainty of the things which you have been taught.

1.20    God Became Man in Jesus Christ

JN 1:1-18

        1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 All things were
made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made. 4 In
him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
        6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 He came
for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe
through him. 8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the
light. 9 The true light that gives light to every man was coming into
the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him,
and the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own did
not receive him. 12 But to all who received him, to those who believed
in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-13 who were
born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man,
but of God.
        14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of
grace and truth. 15 John bore witness of him and cried out, saying,
"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me,
for he was before me.'" 16 And from his fullness have we all received,
grace upon grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and
truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; God the
only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.


2.10    Gabriel appears to Zechariah

LK 1:5-25

        5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named
Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 And they were both
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of
the Lord blameless. 7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was
barren, and they were both well advanced in years. 8 Now while he was
serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, 9 according
to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the
temple of the Lord and burn incense. 10 And the whole multitude of the
people were praying outside at the hour of incense. 11 Then an angel of
the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of
incense. 12 And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell
upon him. 13 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah,
for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
and you shall call his name John. 14 And you will have joy and
gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 15 For he will be great
in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong
drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his
mother's womb. 16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the
Lord their God. 17 And he will go before him in the spirit and power of
Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the
disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared
for the Lord." 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know
this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years." 19
And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence
of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good
news. 20 And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the
day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my
words, which will be fulfilled in their time." 21 And the people were
waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the
temple. 22 But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they
perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to
them and remained speechless. 23 And when his time of service was
completed, he went to his home. 24 After these days his wife Elizabeth
conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying, 25 "Thus the
Lord has done to me, in the days when he looked on me, to take away my
reproach among people."



2.20    Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary

        LK 1:26-38

        26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a
city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose
name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. 28
The angel went to her and said, "Hail, O highly favored one, the Lord
is with you!" 29 But she was greatly troubled at his saying, and
considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. 30 And the
angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor
with God. 31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall call his name Jesus. 32 He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David. 33 And he will reign over the house of
Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end." 34 And Mary
said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" 35 And the
angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power
of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born
will be called the Son of God. 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth
in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month
with her who was called barren. 37 For with God nothing will be
impossible." 38 Then Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord;
let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from
her.

        39 In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill
country, to a city of Judah, 40 and she entered the house of Zechariah
and greeted Elizabeth. 41 And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the
Holy Spirit. 42 And she exclaimed with a loud voice, "Blessed are you
among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 43 But why is this
granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For
behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe
in my womb leaped for joy. 45 And blessed is she who believed that
there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord."
        46 And Mary said:
47      "My soul magnifies the Lord,
                and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
48      for he has regarded the lowly state of his servant;
                for behold, henceforth all generations
                        will call me blessed.
49      For he who is mighty has done great things for me,
                and holy is his name.
50      And his mercy is on those who fear him
                from generation to generation.
51      He has shown strength with his arm;
                he has scattered the proud
                        in the imagination of their hearts.
52      He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
                and exalted the lowly.
53      He has filled the hungry with good things,
                and the rich he has sent empty away.
54      He has helped his servant Israel,
                in remembrance of his mercy,
55      as he spoke to our fathers,
                to Abraham and to his seed forever."
        56 And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to
her home.

2.50    Joseph is Reassured in a Dream

MT1:18-25A

        18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his
mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found to be with child of the Holy Spirit. 19 Then Joseph her husband,
being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was
resolved to divorce her quietly. 20 But as he considered this, behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son
of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 And she will give birth to a
son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people
from their sins." 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had
spoken by the prophet:
23      "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,
                and they shall call his name Immanuel,"
which means, "God with us." 24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as
the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife, 25 but did not
know her until she had borne a son.



2.60    The Birth of John the Baptist

LK 1:57-80

        57 Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave
birth to a son. 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had
shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 59 On the eighth
day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him
Zechariah after his father, 60 but his mother said, "No; he shall be
called John." 61 They said to her, "There is no one among your
relatives who is called by that name." 62 And they made signs to his
father, inquiring what he would have him called. 63 And he asked for a
writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." And they all marveled.
64 And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he
spoke, praising God. 65 And fear came on all their neighbors. And all
these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea;
66 and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, "What
then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.
        67 Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and
prophesied, saying:
68      "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
                for he has visited and redeemed his people,
69      and has raised up a horn of salvation for us
                in the house of his servant David,
70      as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
71              that we should be saved from our enemies
                        and from the hand of all who hate us,
72      To perform the mercy promised to our fathers
                and to remember his holy covenant,
73      the oath which he swore to our father Abraham:
74              to grant us that we,
                        being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
        might serve him without fear,
75              in holiness and righteousness before him
                        all the days of our life.
76      And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
                for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,
77      to give knowledge of salvation to his people
                in the forgiveness of their sins,
78      through the tender mercy of our God,
                with which the sunrise from on high will visit us;
79      to give light to those who sit in darkness
                and in the shadow of death,
                to guide our feet into the way of peace."
        80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in
the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.

3.10    Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem, Jesus is born, Angels Appear to the
        Shepherds

LK 2:1-21

        1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a
census should be taken of all the world. 2 This was the first census
that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 And all went
to be registered, everyone to his own city. 4 And Joseph also went up
from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and
lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who
was with child. 6 And while they were there, the time came for her to
be delivered. 7 And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped
him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no
room for them in the inn.
        8 And in that region there were shepherds living out in the
fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And an angel of the
Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and
they were filled with fear. 10 Then the angel said to them, "Do not be
afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to
all the people. 11 For to you is born this day in the city of David a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this will be a sign to you: you
will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger." 13
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God and saying,
14      "Glory to God in the highest,
                and on earth peace among men
                        with whom he is pleased!"
        15 When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the
shepherds said to one another, "Let us go over to Bethlehem and see
this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us." 16
And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying
in a manger. 17 Now when they had seen him, they made widely known the
saying which had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who
heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. 19 But Mary kept
all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 Then the shepherds
returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had
heard and seen, as it had been told them.
                21 And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised,
he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was
conceived in the womb.

3.20    The Genealogy of Jesus Christ

MT 1:1-17

        1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
the son of Abraham:
        2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and
Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, 3 and Judah the father of
Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the
father of Ram, 4 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of
Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, 5 Salmon the father of Boaz
by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of
Jesse, 6 and Jesse the father of King David.
        David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 7 Solomon
the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the
father of Asa, 8 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father
of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, 9 Uzziah the father of
Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 10
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon
the father of Josiah, 11 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his
brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
        12 And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of
Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, 13 Zerubbabel the
father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of
Azor, 14 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim
the father of Eliud, 15 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father
of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, 16 and Jacob the father of
Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called
Christ.
        17 So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen
generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen
generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen
generations.

3.30    The Visit of the Magi

MT 2:1-12

        1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, 2
saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have
seen his star in the East and have come to worship him." 3 When Herod
the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 And
when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people
together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 5 So
they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the
prophet:
6       'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
                are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
        for out of you shall come a ruler
                who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'"
        7 Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from
them what time the star had appeared. 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem
and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you
have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and
worship him." 9 When they had heard the king they went their way; and
behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them,
until it came to rest over the place where the child was. 10 When they
saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. 11 On coming
into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell
down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented
him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh. 12 And being
warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own
country by another way.

4.10    Simeon and Anna's blessings

LK 2:22-39

        22 And when the time of their purification according to the law
of Moses was completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him
to the Lord 23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male
who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"), 24 and to offer
a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, "a pair
of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
        25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and
this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of
Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26 And it had been revealed
to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had
seen the Lord's Christ. 27 So he came by the Spirit into the temple.
And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for him
according to the custom of the law, 28 he took him up in his arms and
blessed God, and said:
29      "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,
                according to your word;
30      for my eyes have seen your salvation
31              which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
32      a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
                and for glory to your people Israel."
33 And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.
34 Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this
child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a
sign that will be spoken against 35 (and a sword will pierce through
your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed."
        36 And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with her
husband seven years from her virginity, 37 and as a widow till she was
eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, but worshipped with
fasting and prayer night and day. 38 And coming up at that very hour
she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for
the redemption of Jerusalem.
        39 And when they had performed everything according to the law of
the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.

5.10    The Flight into Egypt

MT 2:13b-23

        13 Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and
said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay
there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to
destroy him." 14 When he rose, he took the young child and his mother
by night and departed for Egypt, 15 and remained there until the death
of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,
"Out of Egypt have I called my son."
        16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise
men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male
children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or
under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
18      "A voice was heard in Ramah,
                lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
        Rachel weeping for her children,
                refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."
        19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in
a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 20 saying, "Rise, take the young child and
his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the
young child's life are dead." 21 And he rose and took the child and his
mother, and went to the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that
Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was
afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the
district of Galilee, 23 and he went and dwelt in a city called
Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, "He
shall be called a Nazarene."

5.20    Jesus Grows in Stature

LK 2:40

        40 And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with
wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.

6.0     Jesus among the Teachers

LK 2:41-52

        41 His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the
Passover. 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the
Feast, according to the custom. 43 And when the feast was over, as they
were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents
did not know it, 44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a
day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and
acquaintances. 45 And when they did not find him, they returned to
Jerusalem, seeking him. 46 After three days they found him in the
temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them
questions. 47 And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding
and his answers. 48 And when they saw him they were astonished; and his
mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your
father and I have been looking for you anxiously." 49 And he said to
them, "Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my
Father's house?" 50 But they did not understand the saying which he
spoke to them. 51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and
was obedient to them, but his mother kept all these things in her
heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and men.

Part 2 - BAPTISM

7.10    John the Baptist Preaches Repentance

MT 3:1-17

        1 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, 2 and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand." 3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah
when he said,
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
                Prepare the way of the Lord,
                make his paths straight."
4 Now John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a leather belt around
his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem
and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him, 6
and
confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
        7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for
baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee
from the wrath to come? 8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance, 9 and do not
think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.'  For I
tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these
stones. 10 Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every
tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown
into the fire. 11 I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who
is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to
carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 12 His
winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor
and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with
unquenchable fire."
        13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be
baptized by him. 14 But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to
be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" 15 But Jesus answered him,
"Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all
righteousness."  Then he consented. 16 And when Jesus was baptized, he
went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened
and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on
him. 17 And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved
Son, with whom I am well pleased."

MK 1:1-11

        1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

        2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
        "Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
                who will prepare your way";
3       "The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
                'Prepare the way of the Lord;
                make his paths straight.'"
4 John came baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5 And all the land of Judea,
and the people from Jerusalem, went out to him and they were all
baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 6 Now John
was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather belt around his
waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And he preached, saying,
"After me comes One who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals
I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8 I have baptized you with
water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
        9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was
baptized by John in the Jordan. 10 And immediately coming up out of the
water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him
like a dove. 11 And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son,
with whom I am well pleased."

        LK 3:1-18,  21-22

        1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of
Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 2 during the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of
Zechariah in the wilderness. 3 And he went into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of
sins. 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
prophet,
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
                'Prepare the way of the Lord,
        make his paths straight.
5               Every valley shall be filled
        and every mountain and hill brought low;
                the crooked places shall be made straight
        and the rough ways smooth;
6               and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"
        7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by
him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to
come? 8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to
say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that
God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. 9 And
even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore
that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." 10
And the multitudes asked him, "What then shall we do?" 11 And he
answered them, "He who has two tunics, let him share with him who has
none; and he who has food, let him do likewise." 12 Tax collectors also
came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?" 13
And he said to them, "Collect no more than is appointed you." 14
Likewise the soldiers asked him, "And what shall we do?" So he said to
them, "Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely, and be content with
your wages."
        15 As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in
their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ, 16
John answered them all, "I baptize you with water; but one mightier
than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 17 His
winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to
gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with
unquenchable fire." 18 And with many other exhortations he preached
good news to the people.
        21 And when all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also
baptized. And as he was praying, the heaven was opened 22 and the Holy
Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him, and a voice came
from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."

JN 1:19-28

19 Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 20 He confessed, he
did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." 21 And they asked
him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the
prophet?" And he answered, "No." 22 Then they said to him, "Who are
you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about
yourself?" 23 He said,
        "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
        'Make straight the way of the Lord,'
as the prophet Isaiah said." 24 Now they had been sent from the
Pharisees. 25 They asked him, "Then why do you baptize, if you are not
the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?" 26 John answered them, "I
baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not
know. 27 It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am
not worthy to untie." 28 This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan,
where John was baptizing.

        1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil. 2 And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and
afterward he was hungry. 3 And the tempter came and said to him, "If
you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of
bread." 4 But he answered, "It is written,
        'Man shall not live by bread alone,
                but by every word that proceeds
                        from the mouth of God.'"
5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle
of the temple, 6 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw
yourself down. For it is written,
        'He will give his angels charge of you,'
                and 'In their hands they will bear you up,
        lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
7 Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not tempt the
Lord your God.'" 8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain,
and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. 9 And he
said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and
worship me." 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Away, Satan! for it is
written,
        'You shall worship the Lord your God
                and him only shall you serve.'"
        11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and
ministered to him.

MK 1:12-13

        12 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. 13
And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was
with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.

LK 4:1-13

        1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 being tempted for forty
days by the devil. In those days he ate nothing, and when they had
ended, he was hungry. 3 And the devil said to him, "If you are the Son
of God, command this stone to become bread." 4 But Jesus answered him,
"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'" 5 Then the devil
took him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the
world in a moment of time. 6 And he said to him, "To you I will give
all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me,
and I give it to whom I will. 7 If you, then, will worship me, it shall
all be yours." 8 And Jesus answered him, "It is written,
        'You shall worship the Lord your God,
                and him only shall you serve.'"
9 He took him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and
said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;
10 for it is written:
        'He will give his angels charge of you,
                to guard you,'
11 and,
        'In their hands they will bear you up,
                lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
12 And Jesus answered him, "It is said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord
your God.'" 13 When the devil had ended every temptation, he departed
from him until an opportune time.

9.10    John the Baptist's Witness - Behold the Lamb of God!

JN 1:29b-51

        29 John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb
of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is he of whom I
said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.'
31 I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water,
that he might be revealed to Israel." 32 And John bore witness, "I saw
the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him. 33 I
did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me,
'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who
baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' 34 And I have seen and testified that
this is the Son of God."
        35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his
disciples. 36 And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold,
the Lamb of God!" 37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they
followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to
them, "What do you seek?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which means
Teacher), "where are you staying?" 39 He said to them, "Come and see."
They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that
day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two who heard John
speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first
found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the
Messiah" (which means the Christ). 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You shall be called
Cephas" (which means Peter).
        43 The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. And he found
Philip and said to him, "Follow me." 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida,
the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to
him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the
prophets, wrote - Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." 46 And
Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip
said to him, "Come and see." 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him,
and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
48 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him,
"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw
you." 49 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You
are the King of Israel!" 50 Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you,
I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater
things than these." 51 And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of Man."

10.10   The Marriage Feast in Cana of Galilee

JN 2:1-12

        1 On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and
the mother of Jesus was there. 2 And Jesus and his disciples had also
been invited to the wedding. 3 When the wine was gone, the mother of
Jesus said to him, "They have no wine." 4 Jesus said to her, "Woman,
what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come." 5 His mother
said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." 6 Now six stone jars
were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the
Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 7 Jesus said to them,
"Fill the jars with water." And they filled them up to the brim. 8 He
said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the
feast." So they took it. 9 When the master of the feast had tasted the
water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from
(though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the
feast called the bridegroom. 10 And he said to him, "Every man sets out
the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the
poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now." 11 This, the
first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his
glory; and his disciples believed in him.
        12 After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and
his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.

11.10   The Purging of the Temple

JN 2:13-25

        13 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem. 14 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and
sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business. 15 And he
made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out
of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and
overturned their tables. 16 And he said to those who sold doves, "Take
these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of
merchandise!" 17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal
for your house will consume me." 18 Then the Jews said to him, "What
sign do you show to us, since you do this?" 19 Jesus answered them,
"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." 20 The
Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and
will you raise it up in three days?" 21 But he was speaking of the
temple of his body. 22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his
disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the
scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
        23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many
believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did. 24 But Jesus
did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, 25 and he had
no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.

11.20   Spiritual Rebirth - Nicodemus, a Ruler of the Jews

JN 3:1-21

        1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler
of the Jews. 2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi,
we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these
signs that you do unless God is with him." 3 Jesus answered him,
"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see
the kingdom of God." 4 Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born
when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and
be born?" 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is
born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 6
That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born
again.' 8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it,
but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with
everyone who is born of the Spirit." 9 Nicodemus said to him, "How can
this be?" 10 Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and
yet you do not understand these things? 11 Truly, truly, I say to you,
we speak of what we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do
not receive our testimony. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you
do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13
No one has ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven - the Son
of Man. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so
must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may
have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only
Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal
life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He who
believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is
condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment, that the light has come into
the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
deeds were evil. 20 For every one who does evil hates the light, and
does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he
who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that
his deeds have been done in God."

12.10   John's Further Witness to Jesus - He must Increase...I must
Decrease

JN 3:22-36

        22 After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of
Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized. 23 Now John also
was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there;
and people came and were baptized. 24 For John had not yet been put in
prison. 25 Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and
a Jew over purifying. 26 And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi,
he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified-
behold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him." 27 John answered,
"A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven. 28 You
yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but I
have been sent before him. 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom;
but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices
greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine
is now full. 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
        31 "He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth
belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from
heaven is above all. 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet
no one receives his testimony. 33 He who has received his testimony has
certified that God is true. 34 For he whom God has sent speaks the
words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure. 35 The Father
loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. 36 He who
believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son
shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."

13.10   The Imprisonment of John the Baptist

LK 3:19-20

        19 But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning
Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the other evil things Herod
had done, 20 added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison.

13.20   Jesus Leaves Judea for Galilee after John's Arrest

MT 4:12

        12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he
withdrew to Galilee.

JN 4:1-3

        1 Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus
himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), 3 he left Judea and
departed again to Galilee.

13.30   Passing through Samaria, Jesus Converts the Woman at the Well and
        many Other Samaritans

JN 4:4-42

        4 Now he had to go through Samaria. 5 So he came to a city of
Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave
to his son Joseph. 6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, wearied as he
was from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth
hour.
        7 There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her,
"Give me a drink." 8 For his disciples had gone away into the city to
buy food. 9 Then the woman of Samaria said to him, "How is it that you,
being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews have no
dealings with Samaritans. 10 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift
of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you
would have asked him, and he would have given you living water." 11 The
woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is
deep. Where do you get that living water? 12 Are you greater than our
father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well
as his sons and his cattle?" 13 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who
drinks of this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the
water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall
give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal
life." 15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may
not thirst, nor come here to draw."
        16 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here." 17
The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You are
right in saying, 'I have no husband'; 18 for you have had five
husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you
have said truly." 19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you
are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews
say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." 21
Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither
on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 22 You
worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is
from the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true
worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the
Father seeks to worship him. 24 God is spirit, and those who worship
him must worship in spirit and truth." 25 The woman said to him, "I
know that Messiah is coming" (who is called Christ). "When he comes, he
will tell us all things." 26 Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am
he."
        27 Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was
talking with a woman, but no one said, "What do you wish?" or, "Why are
you talking with her?" 28 Then the woman left her water jar, and went
away into the city, and said to the people, 29 "Come, see a man who
told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" 30 They went
out of the city and came to him.
        31 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat." 32
But he said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know." 33
So the disciples said to one another, "Has any one brought him food?"
34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me,
and to finish his work. 35 Do you not say, 'There are yet four months
and then comes the harvest'? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and
look at the fields! They are already white for harvest. 36 And he who
reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower
and reaper may rejoice together. 37 For here the saying is true, 'One
sows and another reaps.' 38 I sent you to reap that for which you have
not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their
labor."
        39 Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because
of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did." 40 So when
the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he
stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of his word.
42 They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what
you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is
indeed the Savior of the world."

13.50   Beginning of the Ministry of Jesus in Galilee

MK 1:14

        14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee,
preaching the gospel of God.

LK 4:14-15

        14 Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and
news of him went out through all the surrounding country. 15 And he
taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

JN 4:43-45

        43 After the two days he departed to Galilee. 44 For Jesus
himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 45 So
when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all
that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to
the feast.

14.10   Healing of the Official's Son in Galilee

JN 4:46-54

        46 So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the
water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.
47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to
him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the
point of death. 48 Jesus said to him, "Unless you people see signs and
wonders, you will never believe." 49 The official said to him, "Sir,
come down before my child dies." 50 Jesus said to him, "Go; your son
will live." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went
his way.

15.10   Miraculous Draught of Fishes - the Call of Peter, James and John

LK 5:1-11

        1 Now as the people pressed around him to hear the word of God,
he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret. 2 And he saw two boats by
the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their
nets. 3 Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked
him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the
people from the boat. 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to
Simon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch." 5
And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing!
But at your word I will let down the nets." 6 And when they had done
this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help
them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to
sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" 9 For he and all who
were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had
taken; 10 and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who
were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid.
From now on you will catch men." 11 So when they had brought their
boats to land, they left everything and
followed him

The Pepys Gospel Harmony adds:
[for a while.  And then they returned again to their affairs, until
such time as when Jesus would call them again .]

16.10   Jesus Returns to Nazareth

LK 4:16-30

        16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as
his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and
stood up to read. 17 And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to
him. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written:
18      "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
                because he has anointed me
                        to preach the good news to the poor.
        He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
                and recovery of sight to the blind,
                        to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
19      to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
20 Then he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat
down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 And he
began to say to them, "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing." 2 And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious
words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, "Is not this
Joseph's son?" 23 He said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb
to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here also in your own country what
we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'" 24 Then he said, "Truly, I
say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country. 25 But I tell
you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when
the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a
great famine throughout all the land; 26 but Elijah was sent to none of
them except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a
widow. 27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the
prophet Elisha; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the
Syrian." 28 When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with
wrath. 29 And they rose up and cast him out of the city, and led him to
the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might
throw him down the cliff. 30 But passing through the midst of them, he
went his way.

16.20   Jesus Leaves Nazareth

MT 4:13-17

        13 And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14 that what was
spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
15      "The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
                the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,
                        Galilee of the Gentiles-
16      the people who sat in darkness
                have seen a great light,
        and on those who sat in the region and shadow of death
                light has dawned."
        17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand."

MK 1:15

        15 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
at and; repent, and believe in the gospel."

LK 4:31a

31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee.

17.10   The Second Call of Andrew, Peter, James and John

MT 4:18-22

        18 As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two
brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a
net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 19 And he said to them,
"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." 20 Immediately they
left their nets and followed him. 21 Going on from there, he saw two
other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,
22 and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed
him.

MK 1:16-20

        16 And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
Andrew his brother casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen.
17 And Jesus said to them, "Come follow me, and I will make you become
fishers of men." 18 And immediately they left their nets and followed
him. 19 When he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending
their
nets. 20 And immediately he called them; and they left their father
Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.

18.10   Jesus Casts out a Demon

MK 1:21-28

        21 And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath
he entered the synagogue and taught. 22 And they were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the
scribes. 23 Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean
spirit. And he cried out, 24 saying, "Let us alone! What have we to do
with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you
are-the Holy One of God!" 25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet,
and come out of him!" 26 And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and
crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed,
so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new
teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they
obey him." 28 And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the
surrounding region of Galilee.

LK 4:31b-37

        31 and he was teaching them on the Sabbath. 32 And they were
astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. 33 And in
the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon.
And he cried out with a loud voice, 34 "Ha! What have you to do with
us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are-
the Holy One of God!" 35 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and
come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst,
he came out of him without doing him any harm. 36 And they were all
amazed and said to one another, "What is this word? For with authority
and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!" 37 And
the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding
region.

18.20   Cure of Simon's Wife's Mother and Other Sick People

MT 8:14-17

        14 When Jesus come into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law
lying sick with a fever. 15 He touched her hand, and the fever left
her, and she rose and served him. 16 When evening had come, they
brought to him many who were demon-possessed. And he cast out the
spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. 17 This was to
fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
        "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases."

MK 1:29-38

        29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and
John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew. 30 Now Simon's mother-
in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
31 So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and
immediately the fever left her. And she served them. 32 Now at evening,
when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those
who were demon-possessed. 33 And the whole city was gathered together
at the door. 34 And he healed many who were sick with various diseases,
and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak,
because they knew him.
        35 Now in the morning, a long while before daylight, he rose and
went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed. 36 And Simon and
those who were with him searched for him, 37 and when they found him,
they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you." 38 And he said to
them, "Let us go on to the next towns, so I may preach there also; for
that is why I have come."

LK 4:38-43

        38 And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's
house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they
made request of him on her behalf. 39 So he stood over her and rebuked
the fever, and it left her. And immediately she rose and served them.
40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with
various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every
one of them and healed them. 41 And demons also came out of many,
crying, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them, and would not
allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
        42 Now when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted
place. And the people sought him and came to him, and tried to keep him
from leaving them; 43 but he said to them, "I must preach the good news
of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for
this purpose."

18.40   Preaching throughout all of Galilee

MT 4:23-25

        23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
disease and every sickness among the people. 24 Then his fame spread
throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were
afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-
possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them. 25 Great
crowds followed him-from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem,
Judea, and beyond the Jordan.

MK 1:39

        39 And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their
synagogues and casting out demons.

LK 4:44

        44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

19.20   Jesus Crosses the Lake with his Disciples and Calms a Storm

MT 8:18-27

        18 Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to
go over to the other side. 19 Then a certain scribe came and said to
him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 20 And Jesus said to
him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of
Man has nowhere to lay his head." 21 Another of the disciples said to
him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." 22 But Jesus said to
him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
        23 And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 24
And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was
covered with the waves. But he was asleep. 25 The disciples went and
woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!" 26 And he said to
them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he rose and
rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 And the
men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even the winds
and the sea obey him?"

MK 4:35-41

        35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us
go over to the other side." 36 And leaving the crowd, they took him
along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with
him. 37 And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so
that it was already filling. 38 But he was in the stern, asleep on a
cushion. And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care
if we perish?" 39 Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the
sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.
40 He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?" 41 And
they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who is this? Even
the wind and the sea obey him!"

LK 8:22-25

        22 One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to
them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they set out.
23 As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the
lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger. 24 And they
went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" Then he
awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and
there was a calm. 25 He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they
were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is
this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?"

18.40   Jesus Cures the Demoniacs

MT 8:28-34

        28 When he had come to the other side, to the country of the
Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. 29 And behold,
they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you
come here to torment us before the time?" 30 Now a herd of many swine
was feeding at some distance from them. 31 And the demons begged him,
"If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine." 32 And he
said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the swine; and
behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and
perished in the water. 33 Then those who kept them fled, and they went
away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to
the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet
Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.

MK 5:1-20

        1 They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the
Gerasenes. 2 And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of
the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 3 who lived among the tombs;
and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain, 4 for he had
often been bound with shackles and chains. But the chains he wrenched
apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength
to subdue him. 5 Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he
was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones. 6 And when he
saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped him. 7 And crying out
with a loud voice, he said, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of
the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me." 8 For he
had said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!" 9 Then
Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he replied, "My name is
Legion, for we are many." 10 And he begged him eagerly not to send them
out of the country.
        11 Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.
12 So all the demons begged him, "Send us to the swine, that we may
enter them." 13 So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits
came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two
thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in
the sea. 14 So those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city
and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had
happened. 15 And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been
possessed sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had
had the legion; and they were afraid. 16 And those who had seen it told
the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the
swine. 17 Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their
region. 18 And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been
demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him. 19 Jesus did not
let him, but said, "Go home to your friends and tell them how much the
Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you." 20 And he went
away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for
him; and all men marveled.

LK 8:26-40

        26 Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is
opposite Galilee. 27 When he stepped out on land, there met him a man
from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes,
and he lived not in a house but in the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he
cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, "What
have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do
not torment me!" 29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out
of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under
guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was
driven by the demon into the wilderness. 30 Jesus asked him, "What is
your name?" And he said, "Legion"; because many demons had entered him.
31 And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the
Abyss.
        32 Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside;
and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission.
33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the
herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. 34 When
those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in
the city and in the country. 35 Then people went out to see what had
happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the
demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid. 36 Those who had seen it told them how he
who had been demon-possessed was healed. 37 Then all the people of the
surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for
they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.
38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with
him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, 39 "Return to your home, and tell
how much God has done for you." And he went away, proclaiming
throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
        40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were
all waiting for him.

20.10   Jesus Heals a Paralytic let Down Through the Roof

MT 9:1-8

        1 And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own
city. 2 And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed.
And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Take heart,
my son; your sins are forgiven." 3 And behold, some of the scribes said
to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!" 4 But Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For which is
easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? 6
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to
forgive sins"-he then said to the paralytic-"Rise, take up your bed and
go home." 7 And he rose and went home. 8 When the crowds saw it, they
were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to
men.

MK 2:1-12

        1 And when he entered Capernaum after some days, it was heard
that he was home. 2 And many gathered together, so that there was no
longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And he preached
the word to them. 3 Then they came to him, bringing a paralytic carried
by four men. 4 And when they could not get near him because of the
crowd, they made an opening in the roof above him; and when they had
broken through, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was
lying. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son,
your sins are forgiven." 6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there,
reasoning in their hearts, 7 "Why does this man speak like this? He is
blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 8 And immediately,
when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within
themselves, he said to them, "Why do you reason about these things in
your hearts? 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are
forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your pallet and walk'? 10 But that
you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins"-he said to the paralytic, 11 "I say to you, rise, take up your
pallet and go home." 12 And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet
and went out in the sight of them all; so that they were all amazed and
glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"

LK 5:17-26

        17 One day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers
of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and
Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for him
to heal. 18 Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed,
and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus. 19 When they
could not find a way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went
up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the
midst before Jesus. 20 When he saw their faith he said, "Man, your sins
are forgiven you." 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to
reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive
sins but God alone?" 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he
answered them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts? 23 Which is
easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise up and
walk'? 24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on
earth to forgive sins"-he said to the man who was paralyzed- "I say to
you, rise, take up your bed and go home." 25 Immediately he rose up
before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home,
glorifying God. 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and
were filled with awe, saying, "We have seen strange things today."

20.20   The Call of Matthew

MT 9:9-13

        9 As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew
sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose
and followed him. 10 And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold,
many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his
disciples. 11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his
disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
12 But when Jesus heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need
of a physician, but those who are sick. 13 But go and learn what this
means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call
the righteous, but sinners."

MK 2:13-17

        13 Then he went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came
to him, and he taught them. 14 As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of
Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." So
he rose and followed him. 15 And as he sat at table in Levi's house,
many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his
disciples; for there were many who followed him. 16 And the scribes of
the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with sinners and tax
collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors
and sinners?" 17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who
are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not
come to call the righteous, but sinners."

LK 5:27-32

        27 After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi,
sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me." 28 And he
left everything, rose up and followed him. 29 Then Levi made him a
great feast in his house; and there were a great number of tax
collectors and others sitting at table with them. 30 And the Pharisees
and their scribes complained against his disciples, saying, "Why do you
eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" 31 And Jesus answered
them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who
are sick. 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance."

20.30   Jesus answers Objections as to his not Fasting

MT 9:14-17

        14 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and
the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" 15 And Jesus said
to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as he is with
them? The days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from
them, and then they will fast. 16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth
on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the
tear is made worse. 17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins;
if they do, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are
ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and so both are
preserved."

MK 2:18-22

        18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And
people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples
of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" 19 And Jesus
said to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with
them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from
them, and then they will fast in that day.
        21 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if
he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and the tear is
made worse. 22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does,
the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the wineskins
are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins."

LK 5:33-39

        33 They said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer
prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and
drink." 34 And Jesus said to them, "Can you make the guests of the
bridegroom fast while he is with them? 35 But the days will come when
the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in
those days." 36 He told them a parable also: "No one tears a piece from
a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the
new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old. 37 And
no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will
burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.
38 But new wine must be put into new wineskins. 39 And no one after
drinking old wine desires the new; for he says, 'The old is better.'"

21.10   Jesus Raises Jairus' daughter and heals a Woman with an issue of
Blood

MT 9:18-26

        18 While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came
and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and
lay your hand on her and she will live." 19 So Jesus rose and followed
him, and so did his disciples. 20 And behold, a woman who had suffered
from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the
fringe of his garment. 21 For she said to herself, "If I only touch his
garment, I shall be made well." 22 Jesus turned, and when he saw her he
said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the
woman was made well from that moment. 23 When Jesus came to the ruler's
house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, 24 he said,
"Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at
him. 25 But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took
her by the hand, and the girl arose. 26 And the report of this went
through all that region.

MK 5:21-43

        21 And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other
side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea. 22 Then
came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing
him, he fell at his feet, 23 and pleaded earnestly with him, saying,
"My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands
on her, so that she may be healed, and live." 24 So Jesus went with
him.
        And a great crowd followed him and thronged around him. 25 And
there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years, 26
and she had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that
she owned, and was no better but rather grew worse. 27 When she heard
about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his
garment. 28 For she said, "If I touch even his clothes, I shall be made
well." 29 And immediately the bleeding stopped; and she felt in her
body that she was healed of her disease. 30 And Jesus, immediately
knowing in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in
the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?" 31 And his disciples said
to him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who
touched me?'" 32 And he looked around to see who had done it. 33 But
the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before
him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth. 34 And he said
to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be
healed of your disease."
        35 While he was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the
synagogue's house who said, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the
Teacher any further?" 36 But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the
ruler of the synagogue, "Do not be afraid; only believe." 37 And he
allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother
of James. 38 When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. 39 And when he
came in, he said to them, "Why make this commotion and weep? The child
is not dead, but sleeping." 40 And they laughed at him. But after he
put them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those
who were with him, and went in where the child was. 41 He took her by
the hand and said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, "Little girl, I
say to you, arise." 42 Immediately the girl stood up and walked (she
was twelve years of age). And they were overcome with great amazement.
43 He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them
to give her something to eat.

LK 8:40-56

        40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were
all waiting for him. 41 And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who
was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him
to come to his house, 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve
years of age, and she was dying.
        But as he went, the people pressed round him. 43 And a woman who
had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,
44 came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and
immediately her flow of blood stopped. 45 And Jesus said, "Who touched
me?" When all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the multitudes surround
you and press upon you!" 46 But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; for I
know that power has gone out from me." 47 When the woman saw that she
was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him
declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and
how she had been immediately healed. 48 And he said to her, "Daughter,
your faith has made you well; go in peace."
        49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of
the synagogue's house and said, "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble
the Teacher any more." 50 But Jesus on hearing this answered him, "Do
not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well." 51 When he came
into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter,
James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl. 52 Now all were
wailing and mourning for her; but he said, "Do not weep; she is not
dead, but sleeping." 53 And they laughed at him, knowing that she was
dead. 54 But he took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child,
arise." 55 Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he
directed that something should be given her to eat. 56 And her parents
were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.

22.10   Jesus heals two blind men and Casts out a Demon

MT 9:27-34

        27 And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him,
crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David." 28 When he had entered
the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, "Do you
believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord." 29
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done
to you." 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them,
"See that no one knows it." 31 But they went out and spread the news
about him all over that region.
        32 As they were going out, behold, a mute and demon-possessed man
was brought to him. 33 And when the demon had been cast out, the mute
man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, "Never was anything like
this seen in Israel." 34 But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons
by the prince of demons."

23.10   Jesus Preaches to, and is Rejected by, his own Countrymen

MK 6:1-6a

        1 He went away from there and came to his own country, and his
disciples followed him. 2 And when the Sabbath had come, he began to
teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying,
"Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is
given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands! 3 Is
not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses
and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?" And they took
offense at him. 4 But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without
honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his
own house." 5 Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid
his hands on a few sick people and healed them. 6 And he marveled
because of their unbelief.

24.10   Preaching and Healing in Galilee

MK 6:6b

        6 Then he went around the villages teaching.

24.20   The Calling of the Twelve Apostles

MK 3:13-19a

        13 And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those he
himself wanted. And they came to him. 14 Then he appointed twelve, that
they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach, 15
and to have authority to cast out the demons: 16 Simon, to whom he gave
the name Peter; 17 James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of
James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, "Sons of Thunder";
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot; 19 and Judas Iscariot, who
betrayed him.

LK 6:12-16

        12 In those days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all
night he continued in prayer to God. 13 And when it was day, he called
his disciples to himself; and from them he chose twelve, whom he also
named apostles: 14 Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother,
James and John, Philip, and Bartholomew, 15 Matthew, and Thomas, James
the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 16 Judas the
son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

Part 3 - SERMON ON THE MOUNT

24.30   The Sermon on the Mount

MT 5:1-16

        1 Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat
down his disciples came to him. 2 And he opened his mouth and taught
them, saying:
3       "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
                for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4       Blessed are those who mourn,
                for they shall be comforted.
5       Blessed are the meek,
                for they shall inherit the earth.
6       Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
                for they shall be filled.
7       Blessed are the merciful,
                for they shall obtain mercy.
8       Blessed are the pure in heart,
                for they shall see God.
9       Blessed are the peacemakers,
                for they shall be called sons of God.
10      Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake,
                for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11      Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say
all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake. 12 Rejoice and be
glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the
prophets who were before you.
        13 "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its
taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. 14
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
15 Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand,
and it gives light to all in the house. 16 Let your light so shine
before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father
in heaven.

25.10   A Level Place

LK 6:17-26

        17 And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a
crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea
and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to
hear him and be healed of their diseases, 18 and those who were
troubled with unclean spirits were cured. 19 And all the crowd sought
to touch him, for power came from him and healed them all.
        20 He lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:
        "Blessed are you poor,
                for yours is the kingdom of God.
21      Blessed are you who hunger now,
                for you shall be satisfied.
        Blessed are you who weep now,
                for you shall laugh.
22 Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and
revile you, and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is
great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.
24      But woe to you who are rich,
                for you have received your consolation.
25      Woe to you who are full now,
                for you shall hunger.
        Woe to you who laugh now,
                for you shall mourn and weep.
26 Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for so did their fathers
to the false prophets.

25.20   The Law and the Prophets

MT 5:17-20

        17 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For
truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not
a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
19 Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and
teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven. 20 For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that
of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of
heaven.

25.30   You Shall not Kill

MT 5:21-26

        21 "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall
not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' 22 But I
say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject
to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be
answerable to the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be in
danger of the fire of hell. 23 Therefore, if you are offering your gift
at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against
you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First be
reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift. 25 Agree
with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him to
court, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you
over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 Truly, I say to
you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.

25.31   You Shall not Commit Adultery

MT 5:27-32

        27 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit
adultery.' 28 But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman
lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If
your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is
better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to
be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut
it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your
members than for your whole body to go into hell.
        31 "It has also been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him
give her a certificate of divorce.' 32 But I say to you that every one
who
divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to
become an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits
adultery.

25.32   You Shall not Swear Falsely

MT 5:33-37

        33 "Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You
shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.' 34
But I say to you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is
God's throne; 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by
Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by
your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37 Simply
let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,'  and your 'No,' 'No'; anything more than this
comes from evil.

25.33   Do Not Resist One Who is Evil

MT 5:38-42

        38 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth.' 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other
also. 40 And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him
have your cloak as well. 41 And if someone forces you to go one mile,
go with him two miles. 42 Give to him who asks you, and from him who
wants to borrow from you do not turn away.

25.34   Love Your Enemies

MT 5:43-48

        43 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your
neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44 But I say to you, love your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your
Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the
good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love
those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax
collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet only your brethren, what
more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
48 You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

LK 6:27-36

        27 "But I say to you who hear: love your enemies, do good to
those who hate you, 28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who
mistreat you. 29 To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the
other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold
your tunic. 30 Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes
away your goods do not ask them back. 31 And as you wish that men would
do to you, do so to them. 32 If you love those who love you, what
credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 33
And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to
you? For even sinners do the same. 34 And if you lend to those from
whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even
sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much back. 35 But love your
enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your
reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For he is
kind to the ungrateful and evil. 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is
merciful.

25.35   When You Give Alms

MT 6:1-4

        1 "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before
men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your
Father in heaven.
        2 "Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before
you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
they
may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their
reward. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand
know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your charitable deed may
be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

25.36   When you Pray

MT 6:5-15

        5 "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For
they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners,
that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received
their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door and
pray to your Father, who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in
secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not use empty
repetitions as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard
for their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what
you need before you ask him. 9 Pray, then, in this way:
        Our Father in heaven,
                hallowed be your name.
10              Your kingdom come,
                your will be done
                        on earth as it is in heaven.
11              Give us this day our daily bread.
12              And forgive us our debts,
                        as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13              And lead us not into temptation,
                        but deliver us from evil.'
14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

25.37   When you Fast

MT 6:16-18

        16 "And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites,
for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be
fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 17 But
when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 so that you do
not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret;
and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

25.38   Do not Lay up for Yourselves Treasures on Earth

MT 6:19-24

        19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth
and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up
for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your
treasure is, there your heart will be also. 22 The lamp of the body is
the eye. So if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If
then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 24 No
one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the
other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You
cannot serve God and mammon.

25.39   Do not be Anxious About Your Life

MT 6:25-34

        25 "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you
will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put
on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into
barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more
value than they? 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his
span of life? 28 And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet
I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today
is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe
you, O you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What
shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32
For the Gentiles seek after all these things; and your heavenly Father
knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you as well. 34
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

25.40   Judge Not

MT 7:1-5

        1 "Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with the same
judgment you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you
use, it will be measured to you. 3 And why do you look at the speck in
your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 Or
how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your
eye,' when there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first
take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to
remove the speck from your brother's eye.

LK 6:37-42

        37 "Judge not, and you will not be judged. Condemn not, and you
will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 38 Give, and
it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together
and running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you
use, it will be measured back to you." 39 He also told them a parable:
"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
40 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully
trained will be like his teacher. 41 And why do you look at the speck
in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye? 42
Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck
that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the plank that is in
your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the plank from out of your own
eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in
your brother's eye.

25.41   Do not Give Dogs What is Holy

MT 7:6

        6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not throw your pearls
before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and
tear you in pieces.

25.42   Ask and it Will be Given to You

MT 7:7-12

        7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives,
and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or
what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 11 If you then,
who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who
ask him! 12 So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do also to
them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

25.43   Enter by the Narrow Gate

MT 7:13-14

        13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way
is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.
14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and
few are those who find it.

25.44   You Shall Know Them by Their Fruits

MT 7:15-27

        15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's
clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them
by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from
thistles? 17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree
bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad
tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is
cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus you will know them by their
fruits.


        21 "Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many
mighty works in your name?' 23 And then will I declare to them, 'I
never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!'
        24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does
them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And
the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon
that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the
rock. 26 And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do
them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; 27
and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat
against that house, and it fell. And great was its fall."

LK 6:43-49

        43 "For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear
good fruit. 44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not
gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush.
45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth
good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings
forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
        46 "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
47 Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will
show you what he is like: 48 he is like a man building a house, who dug
deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the
stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it was
well built. 49 But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who
built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the
stream broke, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was
great."

25.44   Conclusion of the Sermons

MT 7:28-29

        28 And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were
astonished at his teaching, 29 for he taught them as one who had
authority, and not as their scribes.

26.10   A Leper is Healed Near Capernaum

MT 8:1-4

        1 When he came down from the mountain, great crowds
followed him. 2 And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying,
"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 3 Then Jesus put out
his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be clean."
Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4 And Jesus said to him, "See
that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and
offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."

MK 1:40-45

        40 Then a leper came to him, imploring him, kneeling down to him
and saying to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 41 And
Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him, and
said to him, "I am willing; be clean." 42 And immediately the leprosy
left him, and he was made clean. 43 And he strictly warned him and sent
him away at once, 44 and he said to him, "See that you say nothing to
anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your
cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 45 But he went
out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that
Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the
deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter.

LK 5:12-16

        12 While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of
leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, "Lord, if
you
are willing, you can make me clean." 13 And he stretched out his hand,
and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be clean." And immediately the
leprosy left him. 14 And he charged him to tell no one, "But go and
show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing as
a
testimony to them, just as Moses commanded."15 But the report went
around concerning him all the more; and great multitudes came together
to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 16 But he often
withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.

Part 4 - AFTER THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT

27.10   The Healing of the Centurion's Servant

MT 8:5-13

        5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him,
asking for help, 6 and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at
home, in terrible distress." 7 And Jesus said to him, "I will come and
heal him." 8 But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to
have you come under my roof. But only say the word, and my servant will
be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under
me. And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,'
and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 10 When
Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him,
"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.
11 I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the
sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 13 Then to the centurion Jesus
said, "Go; be it done for you as you have believed." And his servant
was healed at that very hour.

LK 7:1-10

        1 When he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the
people, he entered Capernaum. 2 A centurion's servant, who was dear to
him, was sick and ready to die. 3 When he heard of Jesus, he sent to
him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. 4 And
when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "He is
worthy to have you do this for him, 5 for he loves our nation, and has
built us our synagogue." 6 And Jesus went with them. When he was not
far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him,
"Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come
under my roof. 7 Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to
come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8 For I
am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one,
'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my
servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 9 When Jesus heard this, he
marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that followed him, "I
tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." 10 And
when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the
servant well.

28.10   Jesus Charges the Twelve Apostles and Sends Them Forth

MT 9:35-11:1

        35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
every disease and every sickness. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had
compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like
sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, "The
harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 Therefore pray the
Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
10
        1 And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them
authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every
disease and every sickness. 2 The names of the twelve apostles are
these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James
the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip and Bartholomew;
Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and
Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
        5 These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: "Do not go
among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6 But go
rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And preach as you
go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' 8 Heal the sick,
cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have
received, freely give. 9 Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your
belts, 10 nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a
staff; for the worker is worthy of his food. 11 Now whatever village or
town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you
go out. 12 As you enter the house, give it your greeting. 13 And if the
house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy,
let your peace return to you. 14 And if any one will not receive you or
listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave
that house or town. 15 Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable
on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that
town.
        16 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.
Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 17 But beware of
men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their
synagogues. 18 You will be brought before governors and kings for my
sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 19 But when they
deliver you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are
to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; 20
for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking
through you. 21 Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a
father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have
them put to death. 22 And you will be hated by all for my name's sake.
But he who endures to the end will be saved. 23 When they persecute you
in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not
have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
        24 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his
master. 25 It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and
the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the
house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!
        26 "So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will
not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. 27 What I tell you
in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your
ear, proclaim on the housetops. 28 And do not fear those who kill the
body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who can destroy both
soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And
not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father's will.
30 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not,
therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
        32 "Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will also
acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven. 33 But whoever denies me
before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
        34 "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did
not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to set a man
'against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-
in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and a man's enemies will be those
of his own household.' 37 He who loves father or mother more than me is
not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me; 38 and he who does not take his cross and follow me is
not worthy of me. 39 He who finds his life will lose it, and he who
loses his life for my sake will find it.
        40 "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me
receives him who sent me. 41 He who receives a prophet because he is a
prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a
righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous
man's reward. 42 And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a
cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he
shall not lose his reward."
11
        1 And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples,
he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.


MK 6:7-13

        7 And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two
by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 8 He
commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff-no bag,
no bread, no money in their belts-9 but to wear sandals and not put on
two tunics. 10 And he said to them, "Where you enter a house, stay
there until you leave that place. 11 And if any place will not receive
you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust
that is on your feet for a testimony against them." 12 So they went out
and preached that people should repent. 13 And they cast out many
demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.

LK 9:1-6

        1 Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and
authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. 2 And he sent them out
to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 3 And he said to
them, "Take nothing for the journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor
money; and do not have two tunics. 4 Whatever house you enter, stay
there, and from there depart. 5 And wherever they do not receive you,
when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a
testimony against them." 6 So they departed and went through the towns,
preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.

29.10   The Widow's Son Raised From the Dead at Nain

LK 7:11-17

        11 Soon afterward, he went to a city called Nain, and his
disciples and a large crowd went along with him. 12 As he came near the
gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only
son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city
was with her. 13 When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and
said to her, "Do not weep." 14 Then he came and touched the open
coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And he said, "Young man,
I say to you, arise." 15 The dead man sat up, and began to speak. And
he gave him to his mother. 16 Fear seized them all; and they glorified
God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us;" and "God has
visited his people." 17 And this report about him spread throughout all
Judea and all the surrounding country.

30.10   John the Baptist (in prison) Sends Doubting Disciples to Jesus

MT 11:2-19

        2 Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he
sent word by his disciples 3 and said to him, "Are you the One who is
to come, or shall we look for another?" 4 And Jesus answered them, "Go
and tell John what you hear and see: 5 the blind receive their sight
and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the
dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. 6 And
blessed is he who is not offended because of me." 7 As they went away,
Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go
out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 8 But what
did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those
who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 9 Then what did you go out
to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 10 For
this is he of whom it is written:
        'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
                who will prepare your way before you.'
11 Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen
one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom
of heaven is greater than he. 12 From the days of John the Baptist
until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of
violence take it by force. 13 For all the Prophets and the Law
prophesied until John. 14 And if you are willing to accept it, he is
the Elijah who is to come. 15 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
        16 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like
children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,
17      'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
                we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a
demon.' 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say,
'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and
sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her deeds."

LK 7:18-35

        18 Then the disciples of John told him about all these things. 19
And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord,
saying, "Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
20 When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent
us to you, saying, 'Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look
for another?'" 21 At that very hour he cured many of diseases and
afflictions and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave
sight. 22 He answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and
heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the
good news preached to them. 23 And blessed is he who is not offended
because of me." 24 When the messengers of John had departed, he began
to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 25 What then did you go
out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are
gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. 26 But
what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a
prophet. 27 This is he of whom it is written:
        'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
                who will prepare your way before you.'
28 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than
John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than
he." 29 (And when they heard him, all the people, even the tax
collectors, justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of
John. 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God
for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)
        31 "To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and
what are they like? 32 They are like children sitting in the
marketplace and calling to one another:
        'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
                we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine,
and you say, 'He has a demon.' 34 The Son of Man has come eating and
drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of
tax collectors and sinners!' 35 But wisdom is justified by all her
children."

31.10   The Anointing of Jesus Feet in the House of Simon the Pharisee

LK 7:36-8:3

        36 One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went to
the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table. 37 And behold, a woman
of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was
reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster
flask of perfume, 38 and as she stood behind him at his feet, weeping,
she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair
of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.
39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to
himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what
sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner." 40 And
Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he
said, "Teacher, say it." 41 "A certain creditor had two debtors. One
owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they had
nothing with which to pay him back, he freely forgave them both. Now
which of them will love him more?" 43 Simon answered, "I suppose the
one to whom he forgave more." And he said to him, "You have judged
rightly." 44 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you
see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet,
but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of
her head. 45 You gave me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss
my feet from the time I came in. 46 You did not anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. 47 Therefore I tell
you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But he
who is forgiven little, loves little." 48 And he said to her, "Your
sins are forgiven." 49 Then those who reclined at the table with him
began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" 50
He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
8
        1 Soon afterward, he went on through every city and village,
preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the
twelve were with him, 2 and also some women who had been healed of evil
spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons
had come out, 3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and
Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their means.

32.10   Jesus Charges the Seventy Disciples and Sends Them Forth

MT 11:20-24

        20 Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty
works had been done, because they did not repent. 21 "Woe to you,
Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were
done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
23 And you, Capernaum,
        will you be exalted to heaven?
                You shall be brought down to Hades.
For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom,
it would have remained until this day. 24 But I tell you that it shall
be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for
you."

LK 10:1-16

        1 After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them
ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself
was about to go. 2 And he said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but
the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send
out laborers into his harvest. 3 Go your way; behold, I send you out as
lambs among wolves. 4 Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no
one on the road. 5 Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this
house.' 6 And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him;
if not, it will return to you. 7 And remain in the same house, eating
and drinking what they give, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not
go from house to house. 8 Whenever you enter a town and they receive
you, eat what is set before you. 9 Heal the sick there and say to them,
'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' 10 But whenever you enter a
town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say, 11 'Even
the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you.
Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.' 12 I
tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that
town.
        13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the
mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than
for you.
15 And you, Capernaum,
        will you be exalted to heaven?
                You shall be brought down to Hades!
        16 "He who hears you hears me, he who rejects you rejects me, and
he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."

33.10   The Return of the Disciples from Their Mission

MT 11:25-30

        25 At that time Jesus declared, "I thank you, Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and
intelligent and have revealed them to babes. 26 Yes, Father, for this
was
your good pleasure.
        27 "All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one
knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the
Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all
you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my


yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light."

LK 10:17-24

        17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons
are subject to us in your name." 18 And he said to them, "I saw Satan
fall like lightning from heaven. 19 Behold, I have given you authority
to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice in
this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names
are written in heaven."
        21 At that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I
thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these
things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Yes,
Father, for so it was your good pleasure. 22 All things have been
delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except
the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom
the Son chooses to reveal him." 23 Then he turned to his disciples and
said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see. 24 For I
tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and
did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."


Part 5 - AFTER THE RETURN OF THE SEVENTY DISCIPLES

34.10   The Parable of the Good Samaritan

LK 10:25-37

        25 And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying,
"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" 26 He said to him,
"What is written in the law? How do you read?" 27 And he answered,
"'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind'; and
'your neighbor as yourself.'" 28 And he said to him, "You have answered
right; do this, and you will live." 29 But he, wanting to justify
himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" 30 Jesus said: "A man
was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers,
who stripped him of his clothing, beat him, and departed, leaving him
half dead. 31 Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when
he saw him he passed by on the other side. 32 So likewise, a Levite,
when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33
But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw
him, he had compassion. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds,
pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought
him to an inn, and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two
denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and
whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' 36 Which
of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among
the robbers?" 37 He said, "The one who showed mercy on him." And Jesus
said to him, "Go and do likewise."

35.10   Mary and Martha

LK 10:38-42

        38 Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a
woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. 39 And she had a sister
called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word. 40
But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and
said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?
Tell her then to help me." 41 But the Lord answered her, "Martha,
Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things; 42 but only one
thing is needed. And Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be
taken away from her."

36.10   Jesus Teaches the Disciples How to Pray
        (The Parable of the Importunate Friend)

LK 11:1-13

        1 He was praying in a certain place, and when he ceased, one of
his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his
disciples." 2 He said to them, "When you pray, say:
        'Father, hallowed be your name.
                Your kingdom come.
3       Give us each day our daily bread.
4       And forgive us our sins,
                for we ourselves also forgive everyone
                        who is indebted to us.
        And lead us not into temptation.'"
        5 And he said to them, "Which of you who has a friend will go to
him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves; 6 for a
friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set
before him'; 7 and he will answer from within, 'Do not bother me; the
door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up
and give you anything'? 8 I tell you, though he will not get up and
give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he
will rise and give him as much as he needs. 9 So I say to you, ask, and
it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be
opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks
finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11 What father among
you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a
serpent? 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If
you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those
who ask him!"

37.10   The Disciples Pluck Ears of Corn on the Sabbath

MT 12:1-8

        1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath.
And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to
eat. 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Look, your
disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath." 3 He said
to them, "Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and
those who were with him: 4 how he entered the house of God and ate the
consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those
who were with him, but only for the priests? 5 Or have you not read in
the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the
Sabbath, and are innocent? 6 I tell you that one greater than the
temple is here. 7 And if you had known what this means, 'I desire
mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

MK 2:23-28

        23 One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they
made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. 24 And the
Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on
the Sabbath?" 25 But he said to them, "Have you never read what David
did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him: 26
how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high
priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful to eat,
except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?"
27 And he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath. 28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

LK 6:1-5

        1 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grain fields, and his
disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their
hands. 2 But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is not
lawful to do on the Sabbath?" 3 Jesus answered them, "Have you not read
what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: 4
how he entered the house of God, took and ate the consecrated bread,
and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but
the priests to eat?" 5 And he said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of
the Sabbath."

38.10   The Healing of a Paralyzed Hand on the Sabbath

MT 12:9-14

        9 And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue. 10
And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him,
"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.
11 He said to them, "What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls
into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out? 12
Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to
do good on the Sabbath." 13 Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your
hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the
other.

MK 3:1-5

        1 He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a
withered hand. 2 And they watched him closely, to see whether he would
heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. 3 And he said
to the man who had the withered hand, "Come here." 4 Then he said to
them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save
life or to kill?" But they kept silent. 5 And he looked around at them
with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the
man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was
restored.

LK 6:6-10

        6 On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and a
man was there whose right hand was withered. 7 The scribes and the
Pharisees watched him closely, to see whether he would heal on the
Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. 8 But he
knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand,
"Rise and stand here." And he rose and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said
to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to
do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" 10 And he looked around at
them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and
his hand was restored.

39.10   A Hostile Council of Pharisees - Jesus Withdraws

MT 12:14-21

        14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they
might destroy him.
        15 Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed
him, and he healed them all, 16 and ordered them not to make him known.
        17 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
18      "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,
                my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased!
        I will put my Spirit upon him,
                and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
19      He will not quarrel or cry out;
                nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
20      A bruised reed he will not break,
                and a smoldering wick he will not quench,
        till he sends forth justice to victory;
21              and in his name will the Gentiles hope."

MK 3:6-12

        6 Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the
Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
        7 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great
multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea 8 and Jerusalem and
Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great
multitude, when they heard how many things he was doing, came to him. 9
And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of
the crowd, lest they should crush him. 10 For he had healed many, so
that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him. 11 And
whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and
cried out, "You are the Son of God." 12 But he strictly ordered them
not to make him known.

LK 6:11

        11 But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another
what they might do to Jesus.

40.10   Jesus Heals and the Pharisees Seek a Sign

MT 12:22-45

        22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind
and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw.
23 And all the people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of
David?" 24 But when the Pharisees heard this they said, "It is only by
Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."
25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided
against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against
itself will not stand. 26 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided
against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out
demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they
shall be your judges. 28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God,
then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29 Or how can one enter a
strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the
strong man? And then he will plunder his house. 30 He who is not with
me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. 31
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but
the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 Anyone who
speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever
speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age
or in the age to come.
        33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the
tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. 34 You
brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good man out of the
good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man
out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. 36 But I tell you
that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every
careless word they have spoken. 37 For by your words you will be
justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
        38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, "Teacher,
we want to see a sign from you." 39 But he answered them, "An evil and
adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it
except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For as Jonah was three days
and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will
be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of
Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn
it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater
than Jonah is here. 42 The queen of the South will rise at the judgment
with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than
Solomon is here.
        43 "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry
places, seeking rest, and finds none. 44 Then he says, 'I will return
to my house from which I came.' And when he comes he finds it empty,
swept, and put in order. 45 Then he goes and takes with him seven other
spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and
the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be
with this wicked generation."

MK 3:20-31

        20 Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that
they could not even eat. 21 When his family heard about this, they went
to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."  22 And
the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by
Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons." 23 So
he called them to himself and said to them in parables: "How can Satan
cast out Satan? 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom
cannot stand. 25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house
cannot stand. 26 And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is
divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. 27 No one can enter
a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the
strong man. And then he will plunder his house. 28 Truly, I say to you,
all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies
they utter; 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has
forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-30 because they said, "He
has an unclean
spirit."

LK 11:14-32

        14 Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. So it was, when
the demon had gone out, that the mute man spoke; and the multitudes
marveled. 15 But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub,
the prince of demons." 16 Others, testing him, sought from him a sign
from heaven. 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every
kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided
against itself falls. 18 If Satan also is divided against himself, how
will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebub. 19 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your
sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 20 But if I
cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come
upon you. 21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his
goods are in peace. 22 But when one stronger than he attacks him and
overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted, and
divides his spoils. 23 He who is not with me is against me, and he who
does not gather with me scatters.
        24 "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry
places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, 'I will return to my
house from which I came.' 25 And when he comes, he finds it swept and
put in order. 26 Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits
more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last
state of that man is worse than the first."
        27 As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice
and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts
that nursed you!" 28 But he said, "Blessed rather are those who hear
the word of God and keep it!"
        29 When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, "This is an
evil generation. It seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it
except the sign of Jonah. 30 For as Jonah became a sign to the
Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. 31 The
queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this
generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to
hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon
is here. 32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this
generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah,
and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.

40.20   The Brethren of Christ

MT 12:46-50

        46 While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother
and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 47 Someone told
him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak
to you." 48 But he replied to the man who told him, "Who is my mother,
and who are my brothers?" 49 And stretching out his hand toward his
disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! 50 For whoever
does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and
mother."

MK 3:31-35

        31 Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside
they sent to him, and called him. 32 And a crowd was sitting around
him; and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside,
asking for you." 33 And he replied, "Who are my mother and my
brothers?" 34 And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him,
and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! 35 Whoever does the will
of God is my brother, and sister, and mother."

LK 8:19-21

        19 Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could
not reach him because of the crowd. 20 And it was told him, "Your
mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you." 21
But he said to them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the
word of God and do it."

41.10   Woe to the Pharisees

LK 11:37-54

        37 While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him;
so he went in and sat at table. 38 The Pharisee was surprised to see
that he did not first wash before dinner. 39 But the Lord said to him,
"Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside
you are full of greed and wickedness. 40 You foolish ones! Did not he
who made the outside make the inside also? 41 But give for alms those
things which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you. 42
But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of
herbs, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have
done, without leaving the others undone. 43 Woe to you Pharisees! For
you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the
marketplaces. 44 Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not
seen, and men walk over them without knowing it."
        45 One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, by saying these
things you reproach us also." 46 And he said, "Woe to you also,
lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves
do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. 47 Woe to you! For
you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 48
So you witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they
killed them, and you build their tombs. 49 Therefore the wisdom of God
also said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they
will kill and persecute,' 50 that the blood of all the prophets which
was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this
generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who
perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall
be required of this generation. 52 Woe to you lawyers! For you have
taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and
you hindered those who were entering." 53 As he went away from there,
the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard, and to provoke
him to speak of many things, 54 lying in wait for him, to catch at
something he might say.

42.10   The Parable of the Rich Man

LK 12:1-59

        1 In the meantime, when so many thousands of the multitude had
gathered together that they trampled one another, he began to say to
his disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,
which is
hypocrisy. 2 There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, or
hidden that will not be known. 3 Therefore whatever you have said in
the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the
ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.
        4 "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will show
you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power
to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear him! 6 Are not five sparrows
sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. 7
Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are
of more value than many sparrows.


        8 "I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man
will also acknowledge him before the angels of God. 9 But he who denies
me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 10 And everyone
who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who
blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 11 Now when
they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not
worry about how or what you should answer, or what you are to say; 12
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to
say."
        13 Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to
divide the inheritance with me." 14 But he said to him, "Man, who made
me a judge or an arbitrator over you?" 15 And he said to them, "Take
heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist
in the abundance of his possessions." 16 And he told them a parable,
saying: "The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully. 17 And
he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store
my crops?' 18 And he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns
and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my
goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up
for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry."' 20 But God
said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then
whose will those things be which you have prepared?'  21 So is he who
lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
        22 Then he said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not
worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you
will put on. 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than
clothing. 24 Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have
neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more
value are you than the birds! 25 And which of you by worrying can add a
single cubit to his span of life? 26 If you then are not able to do
this very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest? 27 Consider
the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you,
even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 28 But
if God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of
little faith! 29 And do not seek what you will eat or what you will
drink, nor have an anxious mind. 30 For all the nations of the world
seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31
But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. 32
Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide
yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that
does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. 34 For
where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
        35 "Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning, 36 and be
like men who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding
feast, so that they may open to him immediately when he comes and
knocks. 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching
when he comes. Truly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have
them sit at table, and will come and serve them. 38 If he comes in the
second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those
servants. 39 But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at
what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to
be broken into. 40 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man
is coming at an hour you do not expect."
        41 Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to
all?" 42 And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward,
whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion
of food at the proper time? 43 Blessed is that servant whom his master
will find so doing when he comes. 44 Truly, I say to you, he will set
him over all his possessions. 45 But if that servant says to himself,
'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the menservants
and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, 46 the master
of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at
an hour he is not aware of, and he will cut him to pieces and assign
him a place with the unbelievers. 47 And that servant who knew his
master's will, and did not ready himself or do according to his will,
shall be beaten with many stripes. 48 But he who did not know, and
committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. From
everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom
they entrusted much, of him they will ask the more.
        49 "I came to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish it were
already kindled! 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how
distressed I am until it is accomplished! 51 Do you think that I came
to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. 52 For
from now on there will be five in one house divided: three against two,
and two against three.
53      They will be divided, father against son
                and son against father,
        mother against daughter
                and daughter against mother,
        mother-in-law against daughter-in-law
                and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
        54 He also said to the multitudes, "When you see a cloud rising
in the west, immediately you say, "A shower is coming'; and so it
happens. 55 And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There
will be hot weather'; and there is.  56 You hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the


appearance of the earth and the sky; but how is it you do not know how
to interpret this present time?
        57 "And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? 58 As
you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to settle
with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand
you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. 59 I
tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the very last
copper."

43.10   The Parable of the Fig Tree

LK 13:1-9

        1 There were some present at that very time who told him about
the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2
And Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse
sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered this way? 3
I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. 4
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do
you think that they were worse sinners than all the others who dwelt in
Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all
likewise perish."
        6 He told this parable: "A man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. 7 So he said
to the keeper of his vineyard, 'Look, for three years I have come
seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why should
it use up the ground?' 8 And he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this
year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. 9 And if it bears
fruit next year, fine; but if not, you can cut it down.'"

44.10   Jesus Heals a Woman on the Sabbath

LK 13:10-17

        10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
11 And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen
years; she was bent over and could not straighten up at all. 12 When
Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are
freed from your infirmity." 13 And he laid his hands on her, and
immediately she was made straight, and praised God. 14 But the ruler of
the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said
to the people, "There are six days on which work ought to be done; come
on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day." 15 Then the
Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath
untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water
it? 16 Then ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has
bound for eighteen years, be loosed on the Sabbath day from this bond?"
17 When he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all
the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.


Part 6 - PARABLE OF THE SOWER AND OTHER PARABLES

45.10   The Parable of the Sower

MT 13:1-9

        1 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. 2
And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and
sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore. 3 Then he told them
many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow his seed. 4
And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and
devoured them. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have
much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of
soil. 6 But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they
had no root they withered away. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the
thorns grew up and choked them. 8 But other seed fell on good soil and
yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 9 He who
has ears, let him hear."

MK 4:1-9

        1 Again he began to teach by the sea. and a very large crowd
gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the
sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. 2 Then he
taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching:
3 "Listen! A sower went out to sow. 4 And as he sowed the seed, some
fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5 Some fell on
rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it
sprang up, because it had no depth of soil. 6 But when the sun came up
it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away. 7 Other
seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it
yielded no grain. 8 But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop
that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a
hundred." 9 And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

LK 8:4-8

        4 And when a great crowd came together and people from town after
town came to him, he said in a parable: 5 "A sower went out to sow his
seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled
down, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6 Some fell on the rock;
and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. 7 And
some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 8
But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a
hundredfold." When he had said this he called out, "He who has ears to
hear, let him hear!"

45.11   The Secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven

MT 13:10-17

        10 The disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them
in parables?" 11 And he answered them, "To you it has been given to
know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been
given. 12 For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have
abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken
away from him. 13 This is why I speak to them in parables, because
seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they
understand. 14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says:
        'Hearing you will hear and shall not understand;
                and seeing you will see and not perceive.
15      For this people's heart has grown dull.
                And their ears are hard of hearing,
                        and their eyes they have closed,
                        lest they should see with their eyes,
                and hear with their ears,
        and they understand with their hearts,
                and turn so that I should heal them.'
16 But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.
17 For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to
see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and
did not hear it.

MK 4:10-12

        10 And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked
him about the parables. 11 And he said to them, "To you has been given
the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in
parables; 12 so that
        'seeing they may see but not perceive,
                and hearing may hear but not understand;
        lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.'"

LK 8:9-10

        9 When his disciples asked him what this parable meant, 10 he
said, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of
God; but to others it is given in parables, so that
        'Seeing they may not see,
                and hearing they may not understand.'

45.12   The Parable of the Sower Explained

MT 13:18-23

        18 "Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 when anyone hears the
word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and
snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along
the path. 20 But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he
who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; 21 yet he has
no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation
or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.
22 Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word,
but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the
word, and he becomes unfruitful. 23 But the one who received seed on
the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed
bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."

MK 4:13-20

        13 And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How
then will you understand all the parables? 14 The sower sows the word.
15 And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When
they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was
sown in them. 16 And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground
who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; 17 and
they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when
tribulation or ersecution arises on account of the word, immediately
they fall away. 18 And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are
those who hear the word, 19 but the cares of this world, the
deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and
choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 20 But these are the ones
sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit
thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred."

LK 4:11-15

        11 "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12 The
ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes
away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be
saved. 13 And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the
word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a
while and in time of temptation fall away. 14 And the ones that fell
among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way
they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and
their fruit does not mature. 15 But the ones that fell on the good soil
are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep
it and bear fruit with patience.

45.13   The Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds

MT 13:24-30

        24 Another parable he put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom of
heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men
were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went
away. 26 So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds
appeared also. 27 And the servants of the householder came and said to
him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has enemy
has done this.'  The servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go
and gather them up?'  29 But he said, 'No, lest while you gather up the
weeds you also root up the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together
until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather
the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the
wheat into my barn.'"

45.14   The Parable of the Lamp

MK 4:21-25

21 And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or
under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand? 22 For there is
nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that
it should come to light. 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
        24 Then he said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With the
measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given
you. 25 For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does
not have, from him even what he has will be taken away."

LK 8:16-18

        16 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or
puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter
may see the light. 17 For nothing is secret that will not be revealed,
nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light. 18
Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be
given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be
taken from him."

LK 11:33-36

        33 "No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a secret place or
under
a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light. 34
Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is good, your whole
body also is full of light. But when it is bad, your body also is full
of
darkness. 35 Therefore be careful that the light in you is not
darkness. 36
If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will
be
completely lighted, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you
light."

45.141  The Parable of the Scattered Seed

MK 4:26-29

        26 And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter
seed on the ground, 27 and should sleep by night and rise by day, and
the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how. 28 All
by itself the earth produces grain-first the blade, then the head, then
the full kernel in the head. 29 But when the grain is ripe, at once he
puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."

45.15   The Parable of the Mustard Seed

MT 13:31-32

        31 Another parable he put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom of
heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;
32 it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the
greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air
come and make nests in its branches."

MK 4:30-32

        30 And he said, "With what shall we compare the kingdom of God,
or what parable shall we use for it? 31 It is like a mustard seed
which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in
the earth; 32 yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest
of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the
air can make nests in its shade."

LK 13:18-19

        18 Then he said, "What is the kingdom of God like? And to what
shall I compare it? 19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and
sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of
the air nested in its branches."

45.16   The Parable of the Leaven

MT 13:33

        33 He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like
leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it
was all leavened."

LK 13:20-21

        20 And again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of
God? 21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
of flour till it was all leavened."

45.17   He Did Not Speak Without a Parable

MT 13:34-35

        34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and
without a parable he did not speak to them. 35 So was fulfilled what
was spoken by the prophet:
        "I will open my mouth in parables,
                I will utter things hidden
                        since the foundation of the world."

MK 4:33-34

        33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they
were able to hear it. 34 But without a parable he did not speak to
them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own
disciples.


45.18   The Explanation of the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds

MT 13:36-43

        36 Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his
disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds
of the field." 37 He answered, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of
Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons
of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, 39 and the
enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age,
and the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore as the weeds are gathered and
burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. 41 The Son of
Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom
everything that causes sin and all who do evil, 42 and will throw them
into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth. 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of
their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

45.19   Parable of the Treasure Hidden in a Field

MT 13:44

        44 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a
field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes
and sells all that he has and buys that field.

45.191  Parable of the Pearl of Great Price

MT 13:45-46

        45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of
fine pearls, 46 who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went
and sold all that he had and bought it.

45.192  Parable of the Fishing Net

MT 13:47-50

        47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown
into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; 48 which, when it was
full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the
good into vessels, but threw the bad away. 49 So it will be at the end
of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the
righteous 50 and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will
be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

45.193  Parable of the Householder

MT 13:51-52

        51 Jesus asked, "Have you understood all these things?" "Yes,"
they said to him. 52 And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who
has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who
brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."

46.10 Jesus Preaches to and is Rejected by his own Countrymen

MT 13:53-58

        53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from
there. 54 And coming to his own country he taught them in their
synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man
get this wisdom and these mighty works? 55 Is this not the carpenter's
son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph,
Simon, and Judas? 56 And are not all his sisters with us? Where then
did this man get all these things?" 57 And they took offense at him.
But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his
own country and in his own house." 58 And he did not do many mighty
works there, because of their unbelief.

Part 7 - TWO FEASTS IN JERUSALEM AND TWO FEEDINGS OF
         MULTITUDES

47.10   Jesus goes to a Feast in Jerusalem.
        He Cures an Infirm man by the Cisterns with the Five Porches.
        The Jews Seek to Kill Jesus.

JN 5:1-47

        1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem. 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which
is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. 3 In these lay a
multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed. 5 One man who was
there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 6 When Jesus saw him
lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long
time, he said to him, "Do you want to be made well?" 7 The sick man
answered him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the
water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before
me." 8 Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk." 9 And at
once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.
        Now that day was the Sabbath. 10 So the Jews said to the man who
was cured, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your
bed." 11 But he answered them, "The man who made me well said to me,
'Take up your bed, and walk.'" 12 They asked him, "Who is the man who
said to you, 'Take up your bed, and walk'?" 13 Now the man who had been
healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a
crowd in that place. 14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and
said to him, "See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may
happen to you." 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was
Jesus who had made him well. 16 For this reason the Jews persecuted
Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus
answered them, "My Father is working still, and I am working." 18
Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only
broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making
himself equal with God.
        19 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can
do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for
whatever he does, the Son also does. 20 For the Father loves the Son,
and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him
greater works than these, that you may marvel. 21 For as the Father
raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to
whom he will. 22 For the Father judges no one, but has given all
judgment to the Son, 23 that all may honor the Son just as they honor
the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who
sent him. 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and
believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into
judgment, but has passed from death to life. 25 Truly, truly, I say to
you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice
of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. 26 For as the Father
has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in
himself, 27 and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he
is the Son of Man. 28 Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming
when all who are in the graves will hear his voice 29 and come forth -
those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those
who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
        30 "I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my
judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him
who sent me.
        31 "If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true. 32
There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony
which he bears of me is true. 33 You have sent to John, and he has
borne witness to the truth. 34 Not that the testimony which I receive
is from man; but I say this that you may be saved. 35 He was a burning
and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his
light. 36 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John;
for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works
which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me. 37
And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never
heard his voice, nor seen his form. 38 And you do not have his word
abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent. 39 You
search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal
life; and these are they that testify of me. 40 Yet you refuse to come
to me that you may have life.
        41 "I do not receive glory from men. 42 But I know you, that you
do not have the love of God in you. 43 I have come in my Father's name,
and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you
will receive. 44 How can you believe, who receive glory from one
another, and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 45 Do
not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who
accuses you, on whom you set your hope. 46 If you believed Moses, you
would believe me, for he wrote about me. 47 But if you do not believe
his writings, how will you believe my words?"

48.10   Herodias Dances Before Herod.

MT 14:3-11

         3 For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in
prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, 4 because
John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." 5 And
though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because
they held him to be a prophet. 6 But when Herod's birthday was
celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased
Herod, 7 so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she
might ask. 8 Prompted by her mother,she said, "Give me here on a
platter the head of John the Baptist." 9 And the king was sorry; but,
because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to
her; 10 so he sent and had John beheaded in prison. 11 And his head was
brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her
mother.

MK 6:17-28

        17 For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound
him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;
because he had married her. 18 For John had said to Herod, "It is not
lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 19 And Herodias had a
grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, 20 for
Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous
and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he
heard him gladly. 21 But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday
gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the
leading men of Galilee. 22 And when the daughter of Herodias came in
and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to
the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you." 23
And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half
of my kingdom." 24 So she went out and said to her mother, "What shall
I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!" 25 Immediately
she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to
give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." 26 And the
king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests,
he did not want to refuse her. 27 And immediately the king sent an
executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him
in the prison, 28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the
girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.

48.20   The Apostles Return and Jesus Withdraws with them to a Desert
Place.

MT 14:12-13a

        12 Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and
they went and told Jesus.
        13 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to
a lonely place by himself.

MK6:29-32

        29 When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body,
and laid it in a tomb.
        30 The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had
done and taught. 31 And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a
lonely place and rest a while." For there were many coming and going,
and they did not even have time to eat. 32 So they went away in the
boat to a lonely place by themselves.

LK 9:10

        10 And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had
done. Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called
Bethsaida.

JN 6:1,3

        1 After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee,
which is the Sea of Tiberias. 3 Jesus went up on the mountain, and
there sat down with his disciples.

49.10   The People Follow and Jesus Comes Down From the Mountain to
        Meet Them.
        The Feeding of the Five Thousand.
        At Night Jesus Walks upon the Lake.

MT 14:13b-33

        13 But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from
the towns. 14 When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had
compassion on them, and healed their sick. 15 When it was evening, the
disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's
already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the
villages and buy themselves some food." 16 Jesus said, "They do not
need to go away. You give them something to eat." 17 They said to him,
"We have only five loaves here and two fish." 18 He said, "Bring them
here to me," 19 Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the
grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to
heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and
the disciples gave them to the multitudes. 20 And they all ate and were
satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces
that were left over. 21 Now those who ate were about five thousand men,
besides women and children.
        22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go
before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes. 23 And
after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by
himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, 24 but the boat
by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the
waves; for the wind was against them. 25 And in the fourth watch of the
night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. 26 But when the disciples
saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It is a
ghost!" And they cried out for fear. 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying, "Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid." 28 And Peter
answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the
water." 29 So he said, "Come". Then Peter got down out of the boat,
walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. 30 But when he saw the
wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save
me!" 31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said
to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" 32 And when they
got into the boat, the wind ceased. 33 Then those who were in the boat
worshipped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."

MK 6:33-52

        33 But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on
foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them. 34 When Jesus
went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them,
because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach
them many things. 35 When it was late in the day, his disciples came to
him and said, "This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.
36 Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and
villages and buy themselves something to eat." 37 But he answered them,
"You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Shall we go
and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to
eat?" 38 But he said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and
see." And when they found out they said, "Five, and two fish." 39 Then
he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green
grass. 40 So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties. 41 And
taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and
blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set
before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all. 42 And
they all ate and were satisfied. 43 And they took up twelve baskets
full of broken pieces and of the fish. 44 Now those who had eaten the
loaves were about five thousand men.
        45 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go
before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the
crowd. 46 And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to
pray. 47 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and
he was alone on land. 48 And he saw the disciples straining at the
oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the
night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by
them, 49 but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a
ghost, and cried out; 50 for they all saw him, and were terrified. But
immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I; do not
be afraid." 51 Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind
ceased. And they were completely amazed, 52 for they had not understood
about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.

LK 9:11-17

11 But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed
them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who
had need of healing. 12 Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve
came and said to him, "Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding
villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a
deserted place." 13 But he said to them, "You give them something to
eat." And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish-
unless we go and buy food for all these people." 14 For there were
about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, "Make them sit
down in groups of about fifty each." 15 And they did so, and made them
all sit down. 16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up
to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to
set before the people. 17 They all ate and were satisfied, and they
took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.

JN 6:2,4-21

        2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs
which he performed on those who were diseased. 4 Now the Passover, the
feast of the Jews, was near. 5 Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and
seeing a great multitude coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where
shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?" 6 But this he said to
test him, for he himself knew what he would do. 7 Philip answered him,
"Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to
have a little." 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
said to him, 9 "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two
small fish, but what are they among so many?" 10 Jesus said, "Make the
people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat
down, in number about five thousand. 11 Jesus then took the loaves, and
when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated;
so also the fish, as much as they wanted. 12 And when they had eaten
their fill, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the fragments left
over, that nothing may be lost." 13 So they gathered them up and filled
twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, left over
by those who had eaten. 14 When the people saw the sign that Jesus did,
they said, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."
15 Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force
to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
        16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 got
into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark,
and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18 The sea rose because a strong
wind was blowing. 19 So when they had rowed about three or four miles,
they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they
were afraid. 20 But he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid." 21
Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat
was at the land where they were going.

49.20   Peter's Confession

        JN 6:22-71

        22 On the next day the people who remained on the other side of
the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had
not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had
gone
away alone. 23 However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where
they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 24 So when the
people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got
into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 25 When they found
him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did
you come here?" 26 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your
fill of the loaves. 27 Do not labor for the food which perishes, but
for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will
give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal." 28 Then they
said to him, "What must we do, to be doing the works of God?" 29 Jesus
answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom
he has sent." 30 So they said to him, "What sign will you perform then,
that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do? 31 Our
fathers ate the manna in the desert;
as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'" 32 Jesus
then
said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave
you
the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from
heaven. 33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and
gives life to the world."
        34 Then they said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always." 35
And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me
shall
never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst. 36 But I
said
to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 37 All that the
Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by
no means cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my
own will, but the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of
him
who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me,
but
raise it up at the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that
every
one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and
I
will raise him up at the last day."
        41 The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said,
"I am the bread which came down from heaven." 42 They said, "Is not
this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he
now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?" 43 Jesus answered them, "Do
not murmur among yourselves. 44 No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
45
It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.'
Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. 46 Not
that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has
seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has
everlasting life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the
manna in
the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread which comes down
from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living
bread
which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live
for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is
my
flesh."
        52 Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying,
"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 53 So Jesus said to them,
"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
and
drink his blood, you have no life in you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and
drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last
day. 55
For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He who
eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 57 As the
living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who
feeds on
me will live because of me. 58 This is the bread which came down from
heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this
bread will live for ever." 59 This he said in the synagogue as he
taught in
Capernaum.
        60 Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is a
hard saying; who can listen to it?" 61 When Jesus knew in himself that
his disciples complained about this, he said to them, "Does this offend
you? 62 What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he
was before? 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits
nothing.
The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life. 64
But
there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.
        65 And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to
me
unless it has been granted to him by the Father." 66 From this time
many
of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him. 67 Then Jesus
said to the twelve, "Do you also want to go away?" 68 Simon Peter
answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
eternal life. 69 And we believe, and have come to know, that you are
the
Holy One of God." 70 Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the
twelve, and one of you is a devil?" 71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the
son
of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the
twelve.

50.10   Healing in Gennesaret

MT 14:34-36

        34 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that
surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick, 36 and begged
him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many
as touched it were made well.

MK 6:53-56

        53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret
and anchored there. 54 And when they got out of the boat, immediately
the people recognized him, 55 and ran about that whole region, and
began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they
heard he was. 56 Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the
country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that
they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched
him were made well.

49.20   The Miraculously fed Multitude Seek Him at Capernaum.
        Peter's Confession.

JN 6:22-47

        22 On the next day the people who remained on the other side of
the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had
not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had
gone away alone. 23 However, boats from Tiberias came near the place
where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 24 So when
the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also
got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 25 When they
found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when
did you come here?" 26 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to
you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate
your fill of the loaves. 27 Do not labor for the food which perishes,
but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man
will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal." 28 Then
they said to him, "What must we do, to be doing the works of God?" 29
Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him
whom he has sent." 30 So they said to him, "What sign will you perform
then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do? 31 Our
fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, 'He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.'" 32 Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly,
I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but
my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God
is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
        34 Then they said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always." 35
And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me
shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst. 36
But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 37 All
that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I
will by no means cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to
do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the
will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has
given me, but raise it up at the last day. 40 For this is the will of
my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should
have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
        41 The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, "I
am the bread which came down from heaven." 42 They said, "Is not this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he
now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?" 43 Jesus answered them, "Do
not murmur among yourselves. 44 No one can come to me unless the Father
who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day. 45 It
is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.'
Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. 46 Not
that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has
seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has
everlasting life.

51.10   Jesus Teaches the Real Causes of Defilement and Discourses on
        Pharisaic Traditions

MT 15:1-20

        1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to
Jesus and said, 2 "Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of
the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat." 3 He
answered them, "And why do you transgress the commandment of God for
the sake of your tradition? 4 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and
your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to
death.' 5 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother,
'Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God' 6 he
is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God
of no effect for the sake of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites! Well did
Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:
8       'These people honor me with their lips,
                but their heart is far from me.
9       In vain do they worship me,
                teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'"
        10 And he called the people to him and said to them, "Hear and
understand: 11 not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what
comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man." 12 Then the disciples came
and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when
they heard this saying?" 13 He answered, "Every plant which my heavenly
Father has not planted will be rooted up. 14 Let them alone; they are
blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into
a pit." 15 But Peter said to him, "Explain the parable to us." 16 So
Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not
yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is
eliminated? 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come
from the heart, and they defile a man. 19 For out of the heart come
evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness,
slander. 20 These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands
does not defile a man."

MK 7:1-23

        1 Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come
from Jerusalem gathered together to him, 2 they saw some of his
disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.
3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their
hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders. 4 When
they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash
themselves. And there are many other traditions which they observe, the
washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. ) 5 The Pharisees and
the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the
tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?" 6 And he said to
them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written:
        'This people honors me with their lips,
                but their heart is far from me.
7       In vain they worship me,
                teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'
8 You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of
men." 9 And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the
commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition! 10 For Moses said,
'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or
mother, let him be put to death.' 11 But you say that if a man says to
his
father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from
me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), 12 then you no longer
let him do anything for his father or mother, 13 thus making void the
word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many
such things you do."
        14 And he called all the people to him again, and said to them,
"Hear me, everyone, and understand: 15 there is nothing outside a man
which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out
of a man are what defile him." 17 When he had left the crowd and
entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18 So he
said to them, "Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that
whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him, 19 since it does
not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?" (Thus he
declared all foods clean.) 20 And he said, "What comes out of a man is
what defiles a man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, come
evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery, 22 coveting,
wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. 23 All
these evil things come from within, and they defile a man."

52.10   Jesus Heals the Canaanite's Daughter

MT 15:21-28

        21 And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of
Tyre and Sidon. 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came
out and cried to him, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My
daughter is severely demon-possessed." 23 But he did not answer her a
word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, "Send her away, for
she is crying out after us." 24 He answered, "I was sent only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel." 25 But she came and knelt before
him, saying, "Lord, help me!" 26 And he answered, "It is not good to
take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." 27 "Yes, Lord,"
she said, "yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
masters' table." 28 Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your
faith! Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed
from that very hour.

MK 7:24-30

        24 From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and
Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet
he could not be hidden. 25 But a woman whose little daughter was
possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell
at his feet. 26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth.
And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 27 And he
said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to
take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." 28 But she
answered him, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the
children's crumbs." 29 Then he said to her, "For this saying you may go
your way; the demon has left your daughter." 30 She went home, and
found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.

53.10   Jesus Heals a Deaf and Dumb Man and Works Other Miracles

MT 15:29-31

        29 And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of
Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there. 30 Then
great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the
blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet,
and he healed them. 31 So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute
speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind
seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.

MK 7:31-37

        31 Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through
Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis. 32
Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in
his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him. 33 And he took
him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he
spat and touched his tongue. 34 And looking up to heaven he sighed and
said to him, Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened." 35 And [immediately] his
ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he
spoke plainly. 36 And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he
charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it. 37 And they were
astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He
even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."

54.10   The Feeding of the Four Thousand

MT 15:32-39a

        32 Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days
and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry,
lest they faint on the way." 33 Then his disciples said to him, "Where
could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great
crowd?" 34 And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They
said, "Seven, and a few small fish." 35 He told the crowd to sit down
on the ground. 36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and
having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and
the disciples gave them to the crowds. 37 And they all ate and were
satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces
that were left over. 38 Now those who ate were four thousand men,
besides women and children. 39 And he sent away the crowds, got into
the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.

MK 8:1-10

        1 In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they
had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to
them, 2 "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
with me three days and have nothing to eat. 3 And if I send them away
hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them
have come a long distance." 4 And his disciples answered him, "How can
one feed these men with bread here in the desert?" 5 And he asked them,
"How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven." 6 So he commanded
the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and
having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set
before the people; and they set them before the crowd. 7 They also had
a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also
should be set before them. 8 They ate, and were satisfied; and they
took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 9 About four
thousand men were present. And having sent them away, 10 he immediately
got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the region of
Magadan.


55.10   The Pharisees Ask for a Sign

MT 16:1-4

        1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they
asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 2 He answered them, "When it
is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.' 3
And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and
threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but
you cannot interpret the signs of the times. 4 A wicked and adulterous
generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except
the sign of Jonah." So he left them and departed.

MK 8:11-12

        11 The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from
him a sign from heaven, to test him. 12 And he sighed deeply in his
spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say
to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."

56.10   Jesus Warns the Disciples of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and
Herodians

MT 16:5-12

        5 When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten
to take bread. 6 Then Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees." 7 And they discussed among
themselves, saying, "It is because we have taken no bread." 8 But
Jesus, aware of this, said, "O men of little faith, why do you discuss
among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? 9 Do you not yet
perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and
how many baskets you gathered? 10 Or the seven loaves of the four
thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? 11 How is it that you do
not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 12 Then they understood
that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

MK 8:13-21

        13 And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed
to the other side.
        14 Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had
only one loaf with them in the boat. 15 And he cautioned them, saying,
"Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of
Herod." 16 And they discussed it with one another, saying, "It is
because we have no bread." 17 Being aware of it, Jesus said to them,
"Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet
perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? 18 Having eyes do you
not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? 19
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces did you take up?" They said to him, "Twelve." 20
"And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large
baskets full of pieces did you take up?" And they said, "Seven." 21 He
said to them, "Do you not yet understand?"

57.10   Jesus Heals a Blind man at Bethsaida

MK 8:22-26

        22 And they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind
man to him, and begged him to touch him. 23 So he took the blind man by
the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his
eyes and put his hands on him, he asked him "Do you see anything?" 24
And he looked up and said, "I see men; but they look like trees,
walking." 25 Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look
up. And he was restored, and saw everything clearly. 26 And he sent him
away to his home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."

58.10   Herod's Fear of Jesus

MT 14:1-2

        1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
2 and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, he has risen
from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him."

MK 6:14-16

        14 King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known.
Some said, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is
why these powers are at work in him." 15 But others said, "It is
Elijah." And others said, "It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of
old." 16 But when Herod heard, he said, "This is John, whom I beheaded;
he has been raised from the dead!"

LK 9:7-9

        7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was
perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from
the dead, 8 by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of
the old prophets had risen again. 9 And Herod said, "John I have
beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" So he sought
to see him.

59.10   Jesus Goes to the Feast Secretly.
        He Teaches in the Temple.
        Officers are Sent to Arrest Him.
        An Adulteress is Brought Before Jesus.
        A Blind Man is Restored to Sight.
        Jesus Claims to be the Son of God.

JN 7:1 - 10:21

        1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about
in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 2 Now the Jews' feast of
Tabernacles was at hand. 3 So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and
go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing. 4 For
no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these
things, show yourself to the world." 5 For even his brothers did not
believe in him. 6 Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but
your time is always ready. 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me
because I testify of it that its works are evil. 8 You go up to the
feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet
fully come." 9 Having said this, he remained in Galilee.
        10 But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also
went up, not publicly, but in secret. 11 The Jews were looking for him
at the feast, and saying, "Where is he?" 12 And there was much
complaining among the people about him. Some said, "He is a good man";
others said, "No, on the contrary, he deceives the people." 13 However,
no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
        14 Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the
temple and taught. 15 And the Jews marveled, saying, "How did this man
get such learning, having never studied?" 16 Jesus answered them, "My
teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 17 If anyone is willing to
do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether
I speak on my own authority. 18 He who speaks from himself seeks his
own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true,
and in him there is no falsehood. 19 Did not Moses give you the law?
Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?" 20 The
people answered, "You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?" 21
Jesus answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel. 22 Moses
therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from
the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 23 If on the
Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not
be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's
whole body well? 24 Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right
judgment."
        25 Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this the
man whom they seek to kill? 26 Here he is, speaking publicly, and they
say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he
is the Christ? 27 But we know where this man is from; when the Christ
comes, no one will know where he is from." 28 Then Jesus cried out, as
he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I am from;
and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you
do not know. 29 But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me." 30
Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because
his hour had not yet come. 31 And many of the people believed in him,
and they said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this
man has done?"
        32 The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about
him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest
him. 33 Then Jesus said to them, "I shall be with you a little while
longer, and then I go to him who sent me. 34 You will seek me, and you
will not find me; where I am you cannot come." 35 The Jews said to one
another, "Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him?
Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the
Greeks? 36 What does he mean when he said, 'You will seek me and you
will not find me,' and, 'Where I am you cannot come'?"
        37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. 38 He who
believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow
rivers of living water." 39 Now this he said about the Spirit, whom
those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had
not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
        40 When they heard these words, some of the people said, "Surely
this is the prophet." 41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some
said, "Will the Christ come from Galilee? 42 Has not the scripture said
that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where
David was?" 43 So there was a division among the people because of him.
44 Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.
        45 The officers then went back to the chief priests and
Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?" 46 The
officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!" 47 The Pharisees
answered them, "Are you deceived, you also? 48 Have any of the rulers
or of the Pharisees believed in him? 49 But this crowd that does not
know the law is accursed." 50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before,
and who was one of them, said to them, 51 "Does our law judge a man
without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?" 52
They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will
find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee."
8
        53 Then each went to his own house. 1 But Jesus went to the Mount
of Olives. 2 Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the
people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 3 Then the scribes
and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And when
they had set her in the midst, 4 they said to him, "Teacher, this woman
was caught in the act of adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us
to stone such. What do you say?" 6 They said this to test him, that
they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down
and wrote on the ground with his finger. 7 And when they continued to
ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin
among you be the first to throw a stone at her." 8 And again he stooped
down and wrote on the ground. 9 Then those who heard it went away one
by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left
alone, with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and
said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" 11 She
said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go,
and sin no more."
        12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the
world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the
light of life." 13 The Pharisees then said to him, "You are bearing
witness of yourself; your testimony is not true." 14 Jesus answered,
"Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know
where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I
come from and where I am going. 15 You judge according to the flesh; I
judge no one. 16 And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am
not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me. 17 In your own law it
is written that the testimony of two men is true. 18 I am One who bears
witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me." 19
Then they said to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You
know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father
also." 20 These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the
temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
        21 Then Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you will
seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come." 22 Then
the Jews said, "Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I go you
cannot come'?" 23 He said to them, "You are from below; I am from
above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 24 Therefore I
told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe
that I am he, you will die in your sins." 25 They said to him, "Who are
you?" Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the
beginning. 26 I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he
who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from
him." 27 They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.
28 So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you
will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but
speak just what the Father taught me. 29 And he who sent me is with me;
he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him." 30
As he spoke these words, many believed in him.
        31 Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you
continue in my word, you are truly my disciples. 32 And you will know
the truth, and the truth will make you free." 33 They answered him, "We
are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone.
How can you say, 'You will be made free'?" 34 Jesus answered them,
"Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of
sin. 35 And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son
continues forever. 36 So if the Son makes you free, you will be free
indeed. 37 I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to
kill me, because my word has no place in you. 38 I speak of what I have
seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father."
        39 They answered him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus said to
them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham
did, 40 but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth
which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. 41 You do the
deeds of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of
fornication; we have one Father - God." 42 Jesus said to them, "If God
were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth
from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me. 43 Why do
you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear
my word. 44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your
father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he
speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of
lies. 45 But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. 46 Which
of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe
me? 47 He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not
hear them is that you are not of God."
        48 The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you
are a Samaritan and have a demon?" 49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a
demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. 50 Yet I do not seek
my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge. 51
Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see
death." 52 The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon!
Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, 'If anyone keeps my
word, he will never taste death.' 53 Are you greater than our father
Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?" 54
Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my
Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God. 55 But
you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I
would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word. 56 Your
father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad." 57 The
Jews then said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you
seen Abraham?" 58 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
before Abraham was, I am."
        59 So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself,
and went out of the temple.
9
        1 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 And his
disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that
he was born blind?" 3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man sinned nor his
parents sinned. But that the works of God might be revealed in him, 4
we must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day.  Night is
coming, when no one can work. 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world." 6 As he said this, he spat on the ground and made
clay of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay. 7 And he
said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means, Sent). So
he went and washed, and came back seeing. 8 The neighbors and those who
had seen him before as a beggar, said, "Is not this the man who used to
sit and beg?" 9 Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he is like
him." He said, "I am the man."10 They said to him, "Then how were your
eyes opened?" 11 He answered and said, "A man called Jesus made clay
and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and
wash.' So I went and washed, and I received sight." 12 They said to
him, "Where is he?" He said, "I do not know."
        13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been
blind. 14 Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened
his eyes. 15 Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had
received his sight. He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I
washed, and I see." 16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not
from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can
a man who is a sinner do such signs?" And there was a division among
them. 17 So they again said to the blind man, "What do you say about
him, since he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."
        18 The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had
received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had
received his sight. 19 And they asked them, "Is this your son, who you
say was born blind? How then does he now see?" 20 His parents answered,
"We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 21 but how
he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask
him. He is of age; he will speak for himself." 22 His parents said this
because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if
anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the
synagogue. 23 Therefore his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
        24 So for the second time they called the man who had been blind,
and said to him, "Give God the glory; we know that this man is a
sinner." 25 He answered, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know.
One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see." 26 Then they
said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?" 27 He
answered them, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do
you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"
28 Then they reviled him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are
disciples of Moses. 29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this
fellow, we do not know where he comes from." 30 The man answered, "Why,
this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he
opened my eyes. 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if
any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him. 32
Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the
eyes of a man born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he could do
nothing." 34 They answered him, "You were born in utter sin, and are
you teaching us?" And they cast him out.
        35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found him,
he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" 36 He answered, "Who is
he, sir, that I may believe in him?" 37 Jesus said to him, "You have
seen him, and it is he who speaks with you." 38 Then he said, "Lord, I
believe!" And he worshiped him. 39 Jesus said, "For judgment I have
come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those
who see may become blind."
        40 Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this,
and said to him, "Are we blind also?" 41 Jesus said to them, "If you
were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,'
your sin remains.
10
        1 "Truly, truly, I say to you, the man who does not enter the
sheepfold by the door, but climbs in by some other way, he is a thief
and a robber. 2 But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the
sheep. 3 To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and
he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When he has
brought out all his own, he goes on before them, and the sheep follow
him, for they know his voice. 5 A stranger they will not follow, but
they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers."
6 This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he
was saying to them.
        7 Then Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I
am the door of the sheep. 8 All who ever came before me are thieves and
robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. 9 I am the door. If anyone
enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find
pasture. 10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have
come that they may have life, and have it abundantly. 11 I am the good
shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12 But he
who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep,
sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf
snatches the sheep and scatters them. 13 He flees because he is a
hireling and cares nothing for the sheep. 14 I am the good shepherd; I
know my sheep, and my sheep know me-15 just as the Father knows me and
I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 And I have
other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they
will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd. 17
For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I
may take it again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my
own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
again. This command I have received from my Father."
        19 There was again a division among the Jews because of these
words. 20 Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to
him?" 21 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one who has a
demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

59.20   The Evils of the Pharisees

MT 23:1-39

        1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 "The
scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. 3 So you must observe and
do whatever they tell you. But do not do what they do; for they preach,
but do not practice. 4 They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay
them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with
their finger. 5 But they do all their works to be seen by men; for they
make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long. 6
And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the
synagogues, 7 and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by
men, 'Rabbi.' 8 But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only
one Master, and you are all brethren. 9 And do not call anyone on earth
your 'Father,' for you have one Father, he who is in heaven.

MK 12:38-40

        38 And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like
to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market
places 39 and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor
at feasts, 40 who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long
prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."

LK 20:45-47

        45 And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his
disciples,
46 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love
greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and
the places of honor at feasts, 47 who devour widows' houses and for a
pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation."

60.10   Jesus Questions His Disciples. Peter's Confession.
        Jesus Warns His Disciples of His Coming Passion

MT 16:13-28

        13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
his disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" 14 And they
said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others
Jeremiah or one of the prophets." 15 He said to them, "But who do you
say that I am?" 16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son
of the living God." 17 And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon
Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my
Father who is in heaven. 18 And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on
this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not
prevail against it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and
whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." 20 Then he
strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
        21 From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he
must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief
priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day. 22
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, "Never, Lord! This
shall never happen to you!" 23 But he turned and said to Peter, "Get
behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not
mindful of the things of God, but the things of men." 24 Then Jesus
said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny
himself and take up his cross and follow me. 25 For whoever desires to
save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will
find it. 26 What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world,
and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
27 For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his
Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done.
28 Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste
death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

MK 8:27 - 9:1

        27 And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of
Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men
say that I am?" 28 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say
Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets." 29 And he asked them,
"But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the
Christ." 30 And he charged them to tell no one about him.
        31 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer
many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and
the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 32 He
spoke plainly about this. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke
him. 33 But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he
rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are not mindful
of the things of God, but the things of men." 34 And he called to him
the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, "If anyone would
come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
me. 35 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever
loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. 36 For what
does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? 37
Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? 38 For whoever is
ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of
him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of
his Father with the holy angels."
9
        1 And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you that there are some
standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of
God come with power."

LK 9:18-27

        18 Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples
were with him; and he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" 19
So they answered, "John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others
say that one of the old prophets has risen again." 20 And he said to
them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered, "The Christ
of God."
        21 But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one, 22
        saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the
        elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third
day be  raised." 23 Then he said to them all, "If anyone would come after
me, let him     deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. 24
For whoever     desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses
his life for my sake will       save it. 25 For what profit is it to a man if
he gains the whole world, and loses     or forfeits himself? 26 For whoever
is ashamed of me and of my words, of him        will the Son of Man be ashamed when
he comes in his glory and in the glory  of the Father and of the holy
angels. 27 But I tell you truly, there are some         standing here who will
not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."


Part 8 - THE TRANSFIGURATION

61.10   The Transfiguration.
        Jesus Casts a Deaf and Dumb Spirit out of a Child.

MT 17:1-21

        1 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his
brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 2 And he was
transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes
became as white as the light. 3 And behold, there appeared to them
Moses and Elijah, talking with him. 4 And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord,
it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three
tabernacles-one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 5 While he
was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a
voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased. Listen to him!" 6 When the disciples heard this, they fell on
their faces, and were filled with awe. 7 But Jesus came and touched
them and said, "Rise. Don't be afraid." 8 And when they lifted up their
eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
        9 And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded
them, "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the
dead." 10 And the disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say
that Elijah must come first?" 11 Jesus replied, "Elijah is coming first
and will restore all things. 12 But I tell you that Elijah has come
already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished.
So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands." 13 Then the
disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
        14 And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and
kneeling before him said, 15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an
epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire,
and often into the water. 16 And I brought him to your disciples, but
they could not heal him." 17 Then Jesus answered, "O faithless and
perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I
bear with you? Bring him here to me." 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon,
and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment. 19 Then
the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast
it out?" 20 So he said to them, "Because of your little faith. For
truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you
will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move;
and nothing will be impossible to you."

MK 9:2-29

        2 After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John,
and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was
transfigured before them, 3 and his clothes became dazzling,
exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth could bleach them. 4 And
there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with
Jesus. 5 And Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.
And let us make three tabernacles-one for you, one for Moses, and one
for Elijah." 6 For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly
afraid. 7 And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out
of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!" 8 Suddenly, when
they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
        9 And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to
tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the
dead. 10 So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the
rising from the dead meant. 11 And they asked him, "Why do the scribes
say that Elijah must come first?" 12 Then he said to them, "Elijah does
come first and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of
Man, that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt? 13
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they
wished, as it is written of him."
        14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd
around them, and scribes arguing with them. 15 Immediately, when they
saw him, all the people were greatly amazed, and ran to him and greeted
him. 16 And he asked them, "What are you discussing with them?" 17 And
one of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, who
has a mute spirit. 18 And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down;
he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked
your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they could not." 19 He
answered him, "O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?
How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me." 20 And they brought
the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed
the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the
mouth. 21 And Jesus asked his father, "How long has he been like this?"
And he said, "From childhood. 22 And it has often thrown him both into
the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything,
have pity on us and help us." 23 Jesus said to him, "If you can, all
things are possible to him who believes." 24 Immediately the father of
the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!" 25 And
when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the
unclean spirit, saying to it, "You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you,
come out of him, and never enter him
again." 26 And the spirit cried out, convulsed him terribly, and came
out. And the boy was like a corpse; so that many of them said, "He is
dead." 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he
arose. 28 And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, "Why could we not cast it out?" 29 And he said to them,
"This kind can only come out by prayer."

LK 9:28-43a

        28 Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him
Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. 29 And
as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe
became white and glistening. 30 And behold, two men talked with him,
Moses and Elijah, 31 who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure,
which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 32 But Peter and those
with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they
saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. 33 As the men were
parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be
here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses,
and one for Elijah"-not knowing what he said. 34 While he was saying
this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they
entered the cloud. 35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This
is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!" 36 When the voice had spoken,
Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those
days any of the things they had seen.
        37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a
great crowd met him. 38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried out,
"Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child. 39
And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it
convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him,
bruising him. 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could
not." 41 Then Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how
long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here." 42
While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to
his father. 43 And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.

62.10   Jesus a Second Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection

MT 17:22-23

        22 Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them,
"The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men, 23 and
they will


kill him, and he will be raised on the third day." And they were
greatly distressed.

MK 9:30-32

        30 Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and
he did not want anyone to know it. 31 For he was teaching his disciples
and said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the
hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, after three
days he will rise." 32 But they did not understand the saying, and they
were afraid to ask him.

LK 9:43b-45

        43 But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he
said to his disciples, 44 "Let these words sink into your ears, for the
Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men." 45 But they
did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that
they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this
saying.

63.10   Jesus Pays the Tribute Money
MT 17:24-27

        24 When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel
tax went up to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the temple
tax?" 25 He said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke
to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings
of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from others?" 26
And when Peter said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons
are free. 27 Nevertheless, so that we may not offend them, go to the
sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when
you open its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give
it to them for me and you."

63.20   Jesus Teaches Humility

MT 18:1-5

        1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 2 He called to him a little child,
and put him in the midst of them, 3 and he said, "Truly, I say to you,
unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter
the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this
child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 Whoever receives one
little child like this in my name receives me.

MK 9:33-37

        33 And they came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked
them, "What were you discussing on the road?" 34 But they kept silent;
for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the
greatest. 35 And he sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If
anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
36 And he took a little child, and put him in the midst of them. And
taking him in his arms, he said to them, 37 "Whoever receives one of
these little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me,
receives not me but him who sent me."

LK 9:46-48

        46 And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be
the greatest. 47 Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
little child and set him by him, 48 and said to them, "Whoever receives
this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me
receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one
who is great."

63.30   Jesus Warns His Disciples against Spiritual Exclusiveness

MK 9:38-41

        38 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in
your name and we forbade him, because he was not one of us." 39 But
Jesus said, "Do not forbid him, for no one who does a miracle in my
name can soon afterward speak evil of me. 40 For he who is not against
us is for us. 41 For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of
water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, will by no
means lose his reward.

LK 9:49-50

        49 Now John answered, "Master, we saw a man casting out demons in
your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us." 50
But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid him, for he that is not against
you is for you."


63.30   Temptation to Sin

MT 18:6-20

        6 "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me
to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung
around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe to the
world because of temptations to sin! For temptations must come, but woe
to the man by whom the temptation comes! 8 And if your hand or your
foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for
you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be
thrown into the eternal fire. 9 And if your eye causes you to sin,
pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with
one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
        10 "See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I
tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father
who is in heaven. 12 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep,
and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and
go to the mountains in search of the one that went astray? 13 And if he
finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than
over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 14 So it is not the will
of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should
perish.
        15 "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault,
between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your
brother. 16 But if he will not listen, take one or two others along
with
you, so that 'every matter may be established by the word of two or
three witnesses.' 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the
church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to
you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
        18 "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound
in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. 19
Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything
they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 20 For where
two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them."

MK 9:42-50

        42 "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to
sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round
his neck and he were thrown into the sea. 43 If your hand causes you to
sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with
two hands to go into hell, to the fire that shall never be quenched. 45
And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to
enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. 47 And if
your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown
into hell, 48 where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not
quenched.' 49 For every one will be salted with fire. 50 Salt is good,
but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in
yourselves, and be at peace with one another."

63.40   Exhortation to Forgiveness

MT 18:21-35

        21 Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how often shall my
brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" 22 Jesus
said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.
23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to
settle accounts with his servants. 24 When he began the settlement, one
was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 25 And as he was
not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and
children and all that he had, and payment to be made. 26 So the servant
fell on his knees before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I
will pay you everything.' 27 The master of that servant took pity on
him, released him, and forgave him the debt. 28 But that servant went
out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred
denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying,
'Pay me what you owe.' 29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet
and begged him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.' 30
But he refused, and went and threw him into prison till he should pay
the debt. 31 When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they
were greatly distressed, and went and told their master all that had
happened. 32 Then his master, after he had called him, said to him,
'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
33 Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had
mercy on you?' 34 And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers
to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. 35 So also my
heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you do not forgive your
brother from your heart."

64.10   The Samaritans Refuse to Receive Jesus.
        James and John are angry concerning this and Jesus RebukesThem.

MT 19:1

        1 Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from
Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.

MK 10:1a

        1 Then he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond
the Jordan.

LK 9:51-55

        51 When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his
face to go to Jerusalem. 52 And he sent messengers on ahead, who went
and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him; 53 but
the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem.
54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do
you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"
55 But he turned and rebuked them, 56 and they went on to another
village.

64.20   Crowds Follow Jesus

MT 19:2

        2 And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.

MK 10:1b

        1 And crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom
was, he taught them.

LK 9:56-62

56 and they went on to another village.
        57 As they were going along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow
you     wherever you go." 58 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds
of      the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." 59
To      another he said, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, let me first go and
bury my         father." 60 Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead,
but you go      and proclaim the kingdom of God." 61 Still another said, "I will
follow you,     Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at
my home." 62 Jesus      said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow
and looks back is fit for       the kingdom of God."



Part 9 - PARABLES AND HEALINGS

64.20   Discourse on who shall be Saved

LK 13:22-33

        22 He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching, and
journeying toward Jerusalem. 23 Then one said to him, "Lord, will those
who are saved be few?" And he said to them, 24 "Strive to enter through
the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not
be able. 25 When once the owner of the house has risen up and shut the
door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying,
'Lord, open for us.' He will answer you, 'I do not know where you come
from.' 26 Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your
presence, and you taught in our streets.' 27 But he will say, 'I tell
you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers
of iniquity!'28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you
see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God, and you yourselves thrust out. 29 And men will come from east and
west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God.
30 And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who
will be last."
        31 At that very time some Pharisees came, and said to him, "Get
away from here, for Herod wants to kill you." 32 And he said to them,
"Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures
today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.' 33
Nevertheless I must journey today and tomorrow, and the day following;
for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.

65.10   Jesus Heals a Man of Dropsy on the Sabbath

LK 14:1-6

        1 One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler who
belonged to the Pharisees, they watched him. 2 And behold, there was a
man before him who had dropsy. 3 And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and
Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?" 4 But
they kept silent. And he took him and healed him, and let him go. 5
Then he said to them, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has
fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath
day?" 6 And they could not reply to this.

65.20   Parable of the Great Supper

LK 14:7-24

        7 So he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noted
how they chose the places of honor, saying to them: 8 "When you are
invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of
honor, lest one more distinguished than you be invited by him; 9 and he
who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give place to this
man,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. 10
But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when
your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you
will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. 11
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles
himself will be exalted." 12 Then he also said to the one who invited
him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends
or your brothers, your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also
invite you back, and you be repaid. 13 But when you give a feast,
invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, 14 and you will be
blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the
resurrection of the just."
        15 When one of those who sat at table with him heard this, he
said to him, "Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
16 Then he said to him, "A certain man gave a great banquet and invited
many. 17 And at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to
those who had been invited, 'Come, for all is now ready.' 18 But they
all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought
a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to have me excused.'
19 And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going
to test them. I ask you to have me excused.' 20 Still another said, 'I
have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.' 21 So the servant
came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house
became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets
and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and the maimed, the blind
and the lame.' 22 And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has
been done, and still there is room.' 23 Then the master said to the
servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come
in, that my house may be filled. 24 For I tell you, none of those men
who were invited shall taste my banquet.'"


66.10   The Price of Discipleship

LK 14:25-35

        25 Now great multitudes went with him; and he turned and said to
them, 26 "If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and
mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own
life, he cannot be my disciple. 27 And whoever does not bear his cross
and come after me cannot be my disciple. 28 For which of you, intending
to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether
he has enough to complete it? 29 Otherwise, when he has laid the
foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock
him, 30 saying, 'This man began to build, and was not able to finish.'
31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, will not sit
down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet
him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 32 And if not, while
the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks
terms of peace. 33 So likewise, whoever of you does not give up all
that he has cannot be my disciple.
        34 Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its taste, how shall it
be seasoned? 35 It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill;
men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"

67.10   The Lost Sheep Parable

LK 15:1-7

        1 Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to
hear him. 2 And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This
man receives sinners and eats with them." 3 So he told them this
parable: 4 "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of
them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after
the one which is lost until he finds it? 5 And when he has found it, he
lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6 And when he comes home, he calls
together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me,
for I have found my sheep which was lost.' 7 I tell you that in the
same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents
than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.

67.20   The Parable of the Lost Silver

LK 15:8-10

        8 "Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin,
does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until
she finds it? 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her
friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the
coin which I had lost.' 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in
the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

67.30   The Parable of the Prodigal Son

LK 15:11-32

        11 Then he said: "There was a man who had two sons. 12 And the
younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of
property that falls to me.' So he divided his living between them. 13
Not many days after, the younger son gathered together all he had and
took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his
property in loose living. 14 And when he had spent everything, there
arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in want. 15
So he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, who sent
him into his fields to feed swine. 16 And he would gladly have filled
his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him
anything. 17 But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my
father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and here I
perish with hunger! 18 I will arise and go to my father and will say to
him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. 19 I am no
longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired
servants."' 20 And he arose and came to his father. But while he was
still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion for him,
and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to
him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no
longer worthy to be called your son.' 22 But the father said to his
servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on
his hand and sandals on his feet. 23 And bring the fatted calf and kill
it, and let us eat and be merry; 24 for this my son was dead and is
alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to be merry.
        25 "Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew
near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of
the servants and asked what these things meant. 27 And he said to him,
'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf,
because he has received him safe and sound.' 28 But he was angry and
refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. 29 But
he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have been serving
you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a young
goat, that I might make merry with my friends. 30 But when this son of
yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for
him the fatted calf!' 31 And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with
me, and all that I have is yours. 32 It was right that we should make
merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again;
he was lost, and is found.'"

68.10   The Parable of the Unjust Steward

LK 16:1-18

        1 He also said to his disciples: "There was a certain rich man
who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man
was wasting his goods. 2 So he called him and said to him, 'What is
this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can
no longer be steward.' 3 The steward said to himself, 'What shall I do,
since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong
enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. 4 I have decided what to do, so
that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the
stewardship.' 5 So he called in each one of his master's debtors, and
he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 6 And he said,
'A hundred measures of oil.' So he said to him, 'Take your bill, and
sit down quickly and write fifty.' 7 Then he said to another, 'And how
much do you owe?' And he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said
to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' 8 So the master commended
the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of
this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than
the sons of light. 9 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by
means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive
you into the eternal dwellings. 10 He who is faithful in a very little
is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is
dishonest also in much. 11 If then you have not been faithful in the
unrighteous mammon, who will trust you with the true riches? 12 And if
you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what
is your own? 13 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will
hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one
and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."
        14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and
they scoffed at him. 15 He said to them, "You are those who justify
yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly
esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God. 16 The law
and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the
kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. 17
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of
the law to fail. 18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another
commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband
commits adultery.

68:20   The Parable of Lazarus After Death

LK 16:19-31

        19 "There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and
fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day. 20 And a certain beggar
named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, 21 longing to be fed
with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and
licked his sores. 22 So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 And in
Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off
and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have
mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water
and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.' 25 But Abraham
said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good
things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here
and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a
great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to
you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' 27 And he
said, ' Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house, 28
for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come
to this place of torment.' 29 Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and
the prophets; let them hear them.' 30 And he said, 'No, father Abraham;
but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.' 31 He
said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.'"

69.10   Discourse on Forgiveness, Faith and Humility

LK 17:1-10

        1 Then he said to his disciples, "Things that cause people to sin
are bound to come, but woe to him through whom they do come! 2 It would
be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were
thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones
to sin. 3 Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins, rebuke him,
and if he repents, forgive him. 4 And if he sins against you seven
times in a day, and turns to you seven times, and says, 'I repent,' you
must forgive him."
        5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" 6 So the
Lord said, "If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would
obey you.
        7 "Will any one of you, who has a servant plowing or keeping
sheep, say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and
sit down to eat'? 8 Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare my supper,
and gird yourself and serve me, till I eat and drink; and afterward you
shall eat and drink'? 9 Does he thank the servant because he did what
he was commanded? 10 So you also, when you have done all that is
commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what
was our duty.'"

70.10   The Cleansing of the Ten Lepers

LK 17:11-19

        11 On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria
and Galilee. 12 As he entered a village, ten men who were lepers met
him, who stood at a distance. 13 And they lifted up their voices and
said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" 14 When he saw them, he said
to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they
were cleansed. 15 Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed,
turned back, praising God with a loud voice; 16 and he fell on his face
at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. 17 Then said
Jesus, "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 18 Was no one found
to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?" 19 And he said
to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."

71.10   Jesus Foretells His Sufferings and His Second Coming

LK 17:20-37

        20 Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, he answered them, "The kingdom of God does not come with
observation; 21 nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for
behold, the kingdom of God is within you." 22 Then he said to the
disciples, "The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the
days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. 23 And they will say
to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go after them or follow
them. 24 For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one
part to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. 25 But first
he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 26 Just
as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the
Son of Man. 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in
marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came
and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise as it was in the days of Lot: they
ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29
but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulfur rained from
heaven and destroyed them all. 30 So will it be on the day when the Son
of Man is revealed. 31 On that day, let him who is on the housetop,
with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away. And
likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. 32 Remember Lot's
wife. 33 Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses
his life will preserve it. 34 I tell you, on that night there will be
two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 35 Two women will
be grinding together; one will be taken and the other left." 37 And
they said to him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is,
there the eagles will be gathered together."

71.20   The Parable of the Unrighteous Judge

LK 18:1-8

        1 Then he told them a parable, to show that they ought always to
pray and not lose heart. 2 He said: "In a certain city there was a
judge who neither feared God nor regarded man. 3 And there was a widow
in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Grant me justice
against my adversary.' 4 For a while he refused; but afterward he said
to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor regard man, 5 yet because
this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or she will wear me out
by her continual coming.'" 6 And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
judge says. 7 And will not God bring about justice for his elect, who
cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? 8 I tell you
that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when
the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"

71.20   The Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican

LK 18:9-14

        9 Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 "Two men went up to
the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank you that
I am not like other men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like
this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I
get.' 13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift
up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful
to me a sinner!' 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will
be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."

Part 10 - LAZARUS RAISED

72.10   Jesus Discourses on Marriage and Divorce

MT 19:3-12

        3 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it
lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?" 4 And
he answered them, "Have you not read that he who made them at the
beginning 'made them male and female,' 5 and said, 'For this reason a
man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and
the two shall become one flesh'? 6 So they are no longer two, but one
flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate." 7
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate
of divorce, and to put her away?" 8 He said to them, "Because of the
hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but
from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say to you, whoever divorces
his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits
adultery." 10 The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man
with his wife, it is better not to marry." 11 But he said to them, "Not
all men can accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been
given. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their
mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and
there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it."

MK 10:2-12

        2 The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked, "Is it
lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" 3 He answered them, "What did
Moses command you?" 4 They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a
certificate of divorce, and to put her away." 5 But Jesus said to them,
"Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. 6 But
from the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' 7 'For
this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to
his wife, 8 and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer
two, but one flesh. 9 Therefore what God has joined together, let not
man separate." 10 In the house his disciples also asked him again about
this matter. 11 So he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and
marries another commits adultery against her. 12 And if she divorces
her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."

73.10   Jesus Blesses Little Children

MT 19:13-15

        13 Then little children were brought to him that he might put his
hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus
said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for
to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." 15 And he laid his hands on
them and went from there.

MK 10:13-16

        13 And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch
them; but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was
indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to me; and do
not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 15 Truly, I
say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little
child will not enter it." 16 And he took them in his arms, put his
hands on them and blessed them.

LK 18:15-17

        15 Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch
them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus
called them to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and
do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 17 Truly, I
say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little
child will not enter it."

74.10   The Rich Young Ruler

MT 19:16-30

        16 Now behold, one came up and said to him, "Teacher, what good
thing must I do to have eternal life?" 17 And he said to him, "Why do
you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you
want to enter life, keep the commandments." 18 He said to him, "Which
ones?" And Jesus said, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit
adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, 19
honor your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as
yourself.'" 20 The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What
do I still lack?" 21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go,
sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow me." 22 But when the young man heard this,
he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
        23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is
hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell
you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." 25 When the disciples
heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be
saved?" 26 But Jesus looked at them and said to them, "With men this is
impossible, but with God all things are possible." 27 Then Peter
answered him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What
then shall we have?" 28 Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, at the
renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne,
you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And every one who has left houses or
brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my
name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life. 30
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.

MK 10:17-31

        17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and
knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to
inherit eternal life?" 18 And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me
good? No one is good but God alone. 19 You know the commandments: 'Do
not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false
witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" 20 And he said
to him, "Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth." 21 Then
Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing;
go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." 22 But he fell sad at this
word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
        23 Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard
it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!" 24 And
the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again,
"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of God." 26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and
said to him, "Then who can be saved?" 27 Jesus looked at them and said,
"With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are
possible with God." 28 Peter began to say to him, "See, we have left
everything and followed you." 29 Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you,
there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or
father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30 who
will not receive a hundredfold now in this time-house and brothers and
sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in
the age to come, eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last,
and the last first."

LK 18:18-30

        18 Now a certain ruler asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do
to inherit eternal life?" 19 So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me
good? No one is good but God alone. 20 You know the commandments: 'Do
not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false
witness, Honor your father and mother.'" 21 And he said, "All these I
have kept from my youth." 22 When Jesus heard it, he said to him, "One
thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the
poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." 23
But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
        24 Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for those who
have riches to enter the kingdom of God! 25 For it is easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of God." 26 Those who heard it said, "Then who can be
saved?" 27 But he said, "What is impossible with men is possible with
God." 28 Then Peter said, "Behold, we have left all and followed you."
29 So he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has
left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of
the kingdom of God, 30 who will not receive many times more in this
time, and in the age to come eternal life."

74.20   The Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard

MT 20:1-16

        1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out
early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 2 Now when he
had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into
his vineyard. 3 And he went out about the third hour and saw others
standing idle in the marketplace, 4 and to them he said, 'You go into
the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went.
5 Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did
the same thing. 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found
others standing idle, and said to them, 'Why have you been standing
here idle all day?' 7 They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.'
He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right
you will receive.' 8 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard
said to his steward, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages,
beginning with the last, up to the first.' 9 And when those came who
were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius. 10
So when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each
of them also received a denarius. 11 And when they had received it,
they complained against the landowner, 12 saying, 'These last men have
worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the
burden and the heat of the day.' 13 But he answered one of them,
'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a
denarius? 14 Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this
last man the same as I gave to you. 15 Is it not lawful for me to do
what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am
generous?' 16 So the last will be first, and the first will be last."

75.10   Jesus a Third Time Foretells His Death and Resurrection

MT 20:17-19

        17 Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve
disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, 18 "Behold, we are
going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief
priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, 19 and
deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified,
and he will be raised on the third day."

MK 10:32-34

        32 They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was
walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed
were afraid. And he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them
what was to happen to him. 33 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem;
and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the
scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the
Gentiles; 34 and they will mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him,
and kill him. And after three days he will rise."

LK 18:31-34

        31 Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of
Man by the prophets will be accomplished. 32 For he will be delivered
to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon. 33 They
will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise
again." 34 But they understood none of these things; this saying was
hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.

75.10   Jesus Answer to the Ambitious Request of James and John

MT 20:20-28

        20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to him with her sons
and, kneeling down, asked something of him. 21 And he said to her,
"What do you want?" She said to him, "Grant that these two sons of mine
may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
22 But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking for. Are
you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him,
"We are able." 23 He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, but
to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those
for whom it has been prepared by my Father." 24 And when the ten heard
it, they were indignant with the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them
to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over
them, and their great men exercise authority over them. 26 Yet it shall
not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you must
be your servant. 27 And whoever wants to be first among you must be
your slave-28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to
serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

MK 10:35-45

        35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and
said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask." 36 And he
said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" 37 And they said to
him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and the other at your
left, in your glory." 38 But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what
you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with
the baptism I am baptized with?" 39 They said to him, "We are able." So
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and
with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized; 40 but to sit
at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for
those for whom it has been prepared." 41 And when the ten heard it,
they began to be indignant with James and John. 42 But Jesus called
them to himself and said to them, "You know that those who are
considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great
ones exercise authority over them. 43 But it shall not be so among you.
But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44
and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all. 45 For
even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to
give his life as a ransom for many."

76.10   Jesus Heals Bartimaeus, a Blind Man, as He Enters Jericho

MK 10:46-52

        46 And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with
his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son
of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging. 47 And when he heard
that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son
of David, have mercy on me!" 48 Many rebuked him and told him to be
quiet, but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
49 So Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." And they called the blind
man, saying to him, "Take heart; rise, he is calling you." 50 And
throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus
said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" And the blind man
said to him, "Master, let me receive my sight." 52 Then Jesus said to
him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And immediately he
received his sight and followed Jesus on the road.

LK 18:35-43

        35 As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the
roadside begging. 36 And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what
this meant. 37 They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by." 38 And
he cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" 39 And those who
led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all
the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" 40 So Jesus stopped, and
commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked
him, 41 "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, I want to
receive my sight." 42 And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your
faith has made you well." 43 And immediately he received his sight and
followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it,
gave praise to God.

77.10   Jesus and Zacchaeus

LK 19:1-10

        1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 Now behold,
there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he
was rich. 3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because
of the crowd, for he was of short stature. 4 So he ran on ahead and
climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that
way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him,
"Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house
today." 6 So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. 7
And when they saw it they all murmured, "He has gone in to be the guest
of a man who is a sinner." 8 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord,
"Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have
defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold." 9 And Jesus said
to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a
son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was
lost."

77.20   The Parable of the Ten Pounds

LK 19:11-27

        11 As they heard these things, he went on to tell a parable,
because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the
kingdom of God was to appear immediately. 12 Therefore he said: "A
certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a
kingdom and then return. 13 So he called ten of his servants, gave them
ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business till I come.' 14 But his
citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not
want this man to reign over us.' 15 And so it was that when he
returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these
servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he
might know what they had gained by trading. 16 Then came the first,
saying, ' Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.' 17 And he said
to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a
very little, be in authority over ten cities.' 18 And the second came,
saying, 'Master, your mina has earned five minas.' 19 Likewise he said
to him, 'You also be over five cities.' 20 Then another came, saying,
'Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a
handkerchief; 21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man.
You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.'
22 He said to him, 'I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked
servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay
down and reaping what I did not sow? 23 Why then did you not put my
money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with
interest?' 24 And he said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina from
him, and give it to him who has ten minas.' 25 And they said to him,
'Master, he has ten minas already!' 26 'I tell you, that to every one
who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has
will be taken away. 27 But those enemies of mine, who did not want me
to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.'"


78.10   Jesus Heals Two Blind Man as He Leaves Jericho

MT 20:29-34

        29 And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard
that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of
David!" 31 The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; but they
cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 32 And
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for
you? " 33 They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened." 34 And
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they
received their sight and followed him.

79.10   I and the Father are One

JN 10:22-42

        22 Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
23 and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch. 24 So the
Jews gathered round him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in
suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." 25 Jesus answered
them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my
Father's name, they bear witness of me; 26 but you do not believe,
because you are not of my sheep. 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know
them, and they follow me. 28 I give them eternal life, and they shall
never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father,
who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to
snatch them out of my Father's hand. 30 I and the Father are one."
        31 The Jews took up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered
them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of
these do you stone me?" 33 The Jews answered him, "For a good work we
do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make
yourself God." 34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law,
'I said, you are gods'? 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of
God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), 36 do you say of him
whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are
blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? 37 If I do not do
the works of my father, do not believe me; 38 but if I do them, even
though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and
understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father." 39 Again
they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.
        40 He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John
was baptizing at first, and there he stayed. 41 And many came to him
and they said, "John performed no sign, but all that John said about
this man was true." 42 And many believed in him there.

80.10   Jesus Raises Lazarus from the Dead

JN 11:1-57

        1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of
Mary and her sister Martha. 2 It was this Mary who anointed the Lord
with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazarus was sick. 3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, he whom
you love is sick." 4 When Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is
not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be
glorified through it." 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus. 6 So, when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days
in the place where he was. 7 Then after this he said to the disciples,
"Let us go to Judea again." 8 The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the
Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there
again?" 9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If
anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light
of this world. 10 But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because
the light is not in him." 11 These things he said, and after that he
said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake
him up." 12 His disciples said, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover."
13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant
taking rest in sleep. 14 So then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is
dead; 15 and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you
may believe. But let us go to him." 16 Then Thomas, who is called the
Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die
with him."
        17 So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the
tomb four days. 18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, 19
and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them
concerning their brother. 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house. 21 Martha said to
Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 22
But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." 24 Martha said to
him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last
day." 25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who
believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live; 26 and whoever lives
and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?" 27 She said
to him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God,
who is to come into the world."
        28 And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary
her sister, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you." 29
When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. 30 Now Jesus had
not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha
had met him. 31 The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting
her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed
her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 32 Then
Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet,
saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have
died." 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her
also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 34 And he
said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and
see."
        35 Jesus wept.
        36 Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!" 37 But some of
them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept
this man from dying?"
        38 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a
cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by this time
there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days." 40 Jesus said to
her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the
glory of God?" 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his
eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. 42 I knew
that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people
standing by, that they may believe that you sent me." 43 When he had
said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" 44 The dead
man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face
wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
        45 Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen
what Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 Then the chief priests
and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we to do? For
this man performs many signs. 48 If we let him go on like this,
everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away
both our place and our nation." 49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was
high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all! 50 You
do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die
for the people, and that the whole nation not perish." 51 He did not
say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that
Jesus would die for the nation, 52 and not for that nation only, but
also that he would gather together into one the children of God who
were scattered abroad. 53 So from that day on they plotted to put him
to death.
        54 Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews,
but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town
called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.
        55 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from
the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood
in the temple, "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"
57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if
anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might
arrest him.

Part 11 - PALM SUNDAY

81.10   Mary Anoints Jesus for His Burial

MT 26:6-13

6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7 a
woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume,
and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. 8 But when the
disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste? 9 For
this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the
poor." 10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble
the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. 11 For you always
have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 12 For in
pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
13 Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole
world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."

MK 14:3-9

        1 It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of
Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking
how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him. 2 But they said, "Not
during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people."
        3 And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as
he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of
pure nard, very costly. And she broke the flask and poured it over his
head. 4 But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why
was this ointment wasted? 5 For it might have been sold for more than
three hundred denarii and given to the poor." And they criticized her
sharply. 6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She
has done a beautiful thing to me. 7 For you always have the poor with
you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not
always have me. 8 She has done what she could. She has come beforehand
to anoint my body for burial. 9 And truly, I say to you, wherever the
gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be
told in memory of her."

JN 12:1-8

        1 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where
Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 There they made him
a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at
the table with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of
pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her
hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 4 But
one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him,
said, 5 "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and
given to the poor?" 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but
because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take
what was put into it. 7 Jesus said, "Let her alone, she has kept this
for the day of my burial. 8 The poor you always have with you, but you
do not always have me."

81:20   Public Excitement with Regard to Jesus and Lazarus

JN 12:9-11

        9 Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and
they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom
he had raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests planned to put
Lazarus also to death, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews
were going away and believing in Jesus.

81:30   Jesus Makes His Triumphal Entrance into Jerusalem

MT 21:1-11

        1 Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at
the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, "Go
into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey
tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If any
one says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,'
and he will send them immediately." 4 This took place to fulfill what
was spoken by the prophet, saying:
5       "Tell the daughter of Zion,
        'Behold, your King is coming to you,
                lowly, and sitting on a donkey,
                        a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They
brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus
sat on them. 8 And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 9
The crowds that went before him and those that followed shouted,
        "Hosanna to the Son of David!
                Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
        Hosanna in the highest!"
10 And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying,
"Who is this?" 11 So the crowds said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from
Nazareth of Galilee."

MK 11:1-10

        1 And when they drew near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at
the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 2 and said to them,
"Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you
will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring
it. 3 If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord
has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'" 4 They went
away and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street, and
they untied it. 5 And some of those who stood there said to them, "What
are you doing, untying the colt?" 6 They answered as Jesus had told
them to, and they let them go. 7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus
and threw their garments on it, and he sat on it. 8 And many spread
their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they
had cut from the fields. 9 And those who went before and those who
followed cried out,
        "Hosanna!
        Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
10      Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming!
        Hosanna in the highest!"

29 When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is
called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, 30 saying, "Go into the
village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on
which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. 31 If any one
asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say to him, 'The Lord has
need of it.'" 32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as
he had told them. 33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said
to them, "Why are you untying the colt?" 34 And they said, "The Lord
has need of it." 35 And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their
garments on the colt and set Jesus on it. 36 And as he went along, many
spread their garments on the road.
        37 And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of
Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, 38
saying,
        "Blessed is the King
                who comes in the name of the Lord!
        Peace in heaven
                and glory in the highest!"
39 And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke
your disciples." 40 He answered, "I tell you, if these keep silent, the
stones would cry out."
        41 And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it, 42
saying, "If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for
peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43 For the days will
come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around
you, and surround you and hem you in on every side, 44 and dash you to
the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave
one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of
your visitation."

JN 12:12-19

12 The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 They took branches of palm trees and
went out to meet him, crying,
        "Hosanna!
        Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
                The King of Israel!"
14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,
15      "Fear not, daughter of Zion;
        behold, your King is coming,
                sitting on a donkey's colt."
16 His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was
glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written
about him and that they had done these things to him. 17 The crowd that
had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him
from the dead bore witness. 18 For this reason the people went to meet
him, because they heard that he had done this sign. 19 The Pharisees
then said to one another, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing.
Look, The world has gone after him!"

82.10   The Second Purging of the Temple

MT 21:12-13

        12 And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold
and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-
changers and the seats of those who sold doves. 13 And he said to them,
"It is written,
        'My house shall be called a house of prayer,'
                but you have made it a 'den of robbers.'"


MK 11:15-18

        15 So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus entered the temple and
began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and
overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who
sold doves. 16 And he would not allow anyone to carry merchandise
through the temple. 17 And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not
written,
        'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'?
                But you have made it a den of robbers."
18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to
destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was
astonished at his teaching.

LK 19:45-48

        45 Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who
sold, 46 saying to them, "It is written,
        'My house shall be a house of prayer';
                but you have made it a den of robbers."
        47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests
the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him, 48 but
they could not find anything they could do, for all the people hung
upon his words.

82.20   The Children in the Temple Praise Jesus who at evening goes to
        Bethany

MT 21:14-17

        14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he
healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the
wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the
temple,
"Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant; 16 and they said to
him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes.
Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you
have perfected praise'?" 17 Then he left them and went out of the city
to Bethany, and he lodged there.

MK 11:11

11 Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple. And when he had
looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to
Bethany with the twelve.

83.10   The Withering of the Barren Fig Tree

MT 21:18-22

        18 In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was
hungry. 19 And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it, and found
nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever
come from you again!" And immediately the fig tree withered. 20 And
when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree
wither away so soon?" 21 And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you,
if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done
to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and
cast into the sea,' it will be done. 22 And whatever you ask in prayer,
you will receive, if you have faith."

MK 11:13-14, 20b-26

        13 And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see
if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing
but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 14 And he said to it,
"May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard it.
        20 As they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the
roots. 21 Peter remembered and said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree
which you cursed has withered." 22 And Jesus answered them, "Have faith
in God. 23 Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be
taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but
believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that
you have received it, and it will be yours. 25 And whenever you stand
praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your
Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses. 26 But you do
not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your
trespasses.

84.10   The Authority of Jesus is Questioned

MT 21:23-27

23 And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of
the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what
authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"
24 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question; and if you
tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do
these things. 25 The baptism of John-where was it from? From heaven or
from men?" And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say,
'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
26 But if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all
hold that John was a prophet." 27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not
know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority
I do these things.

MK 11:27-33

        27 Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in
the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him.
28 And they said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things?
Who gave you this authority to do them?" 29 Jesus said to them, "I will
ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority
I do these things. 30 The baptism of John-was it from heaven or from
men? Answer me." 31 And they reasoned among themselves, "If we say,
'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 32 But
if we say, 'From men'"-they feared the people, for all held that John
was a real prophet. 33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And
Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do
these things."

LK 20:1-8

        1 One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and
preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, together with
the elders, came up to him 2 and said to him, "Tell us by what
authority are you doing these things? Or who it is that gave you this
authority." 3 He answered them, "I also will ask you a question; now
tell me, 4 the baptism of John-was it from heaven or from men?" 5 And
they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' 6 But if we say, 'From men,'
all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
prophet." 7 So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
8 And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I
do these things."

85.10   The Parable of the Two Sons

MT 21:28-32

        28 "What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the
first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' 29 He
answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he regretted it and went. 30 Then
he went to the second and said the same thing. And he answered, 'I go,
sir,' but he did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his
father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to
you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you. 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and
you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots
believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent
and believe him.

85.20   The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen and the Vineyard

MT 21:33-41

        33 "Hear another parable: there was a landowner who planted a
vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it and built a
tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country.
34 When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the
tenants, to get his fruit. 35 And the tenants took his servants, beat
one, killed one, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants,
more than the first, and they did the same to them. 37 Last of all, he
sent his son to them saying, 'They will respect my son,' 38 But when
the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir.
Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.' 39 So they took him
and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 Therefore, when the
owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" 41 They
said to him, "He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let
out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their
seasons."

MK 12:1-9

        1 Then he began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a
vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and
built a tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far
country. 2 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, to collect
from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 3 And they took him and
beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 4 Again he sent to them
another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him
shamefully. 5 And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with
many others, some they beat and some they killed. 6 He still had one
left to send, a beloved son.  He sent him to them last, saying, 'They
will respect my son.' 7 But those tenants said to one another, 'This is
the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 8
So they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 9
What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the
tenants, and give the vineyard to others.

LK 20:9-16

        9 Then he began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a
vineyard, leased it to vine-dressers, and went into another country for
a long time. 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that
they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants
beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 11 He sent another servant;
him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-
handed. 12 He sent a third; and they wounded him and cast him out. 13
Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my
beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' 14 But when the tenants
saw him, they reasoned among themselves and said, 'This is the heir.
Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.' 15 So they cast him
out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the
vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and destroy those tenants, and
give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they said, "May
this never be!"

85.30   Jesus the Corner Stone

MT 21:42-44

42 Jesus said to them,
"Have you never read in the Scriptures:
        'The stone which the builders rejected
                has become the chief cornerstone;
        this was the Lord's doing,
                and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
43 "Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from
you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 [And he who
falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls,
it will grind him to powder."]

MK 12:10-11

10 Have you not read this Scripture:
        'The stone which the builders rejected
                has become the chief cornerstone;
11      this was the Lord's doing,
                and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"

LK 20:17-18

        17 But he looked at them and said,
"What then is this that is written:
        'The stone which the builders rejected
                has become the chief cornerstone'?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on
whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."

85.40   The Parable of the King's Feast

MT 22:1-14

        1 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying: 2 "The
kingdom of heaven is like a king who arranged a marriage for his son, 3
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the
wedding; but they were not willing to come. 4 Again, he sent out other
servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my
dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and everything is ready.
Come to thewedding.'" 5 But they made light of it and went off, one to
his own farm, another to his business. 6 And the rest seized his
servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 7 The king was
enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned
their city. 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but
those who were invited were not worthy. 9 Go therefore to the highways,
and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.' 10 And those
servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found,
both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11 But
when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not
have on a wedding garment. 12 And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you
get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. 13 Then
the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him
away, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.' 14 For many are called, but few are chosen."

85.50   Anger and Fear of the Pharisees

MT 21:45-46

        45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
they perceived that he was speaking about them. 46 But when they tried
to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be
a prophet.

MK 12:12

12 And they sought to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they
knew he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went
away.

LK 20:19

19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that
very hour, but they feared the people-for they knew that he had spoken
this parable against them.

85.60   Goodwill of the People

LK 21:37-38

        37 And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he
went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet. 38 And early in
the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.

86.10   Question of Tribute to Caesar

MT 22:15-22

        15 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him
in his talk. 16 And they sent their disciples to him, along with the
Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the
way of God in truth, and you care for no man; for you do not regard the
position of men. 17 Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to
pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" 18 But Jesus, aware of their malice,
said, "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? 19 Show me the money for
the tax." And they brought him a denarius. 20 And he said to them,
"Whose image and inscription is this?" 21 They said, "Caesar's." Then
he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 22 When they heard it,
they marveled; and they left him and went away.

MK 12:13-17

        13 Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians,
to catch him in his words. 14 When they came, they said to him,
"Teacher, we know that you are true, and care about no man; for you do
not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 15 Should we pay them, or should
we not?" But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why do you put
me to the test? Bring me a denarius, and let me look at it." 16 And
they brought one. And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription
is this?" They said to him, "Caesar's." 17 Jesus said to them, "Render
to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's." And they were amazed at him.

LK 20:20-26

        20 So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be
righteous, that they might catch him on what he said, in order to
deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor. 21 And they
asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you
do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth. 22 Is it
lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" 23 But he perceived their
craftiness, and said to them, 24 "Show me a denarius. Whose likeness
and inscription does it have?" They said, "Caesar's." 25 He said to
them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God
the things that are God's." 26 And they were not able in the presence
of the people to catch him by what he said. But marveling at his answer
they were silent.

87.10   Jesus Silences the Sadducees

MT 22:23-33

        23 That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection,
came to him and asked him a question, 24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said
that if a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the
widow, and raise up children for his brother. 25 Now there were seven
brothers among us. The first one married and died, and having no
children, he left his wife to his brother. 26 So the second also, and
the third, down to the seventh. 27 After them all, the woman died. 28
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be?
For they all had her." 29 But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong,
because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 30 For in
the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are
like angels in heaven. 31 But as for the resurrection of the dead, have
you not read what was said to you by God, 32 'I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the
dead, but of the living." 33 And when the multitudes heard this, they
were astonished at his teaching.

MK 12:18-27

        18 Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to
him; and they asked him a question, saying: 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote
for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no
child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his
brother. 20 Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and
when he died left no children. 21 And the second took her, and he died;
leaving behind no children. And the third likewise. 22 So the seven had
her and left no children. Last of all the woman died also. 23 In the
resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife."
24 Jesus said to them, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you do not
know the Scriptures nor the power of God? 25 For when they rise from
the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like
angels in heaven. 26 And as for the dead being raised, have you not
read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said
to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob'? 27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are
greatly mistaken."

LK 20:27-40

        27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came
to him, 28 and they questioned him, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that
if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must
take the wife and raise up children for his brother. 29 Now there were
seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. 30
And the second 31 and then the third took her, and in the same way the
seven died, and they left no children. 32 Finally the woman died also.
33 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all
seven had her as wife." 34 And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this
age marry and are given in marriage. 35 But those who are considered
worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither
marry nor are given in marriage, 36 nor can they die any more, for they
are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the
resurrection. 37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in
the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham
and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.' 38 Now he is not the God of
the dead but of the living, for all live to him." 39 And some of the
scribes answered, "Teacher, you have spoken well." 40 For they no
longer dared to ask him any question.


88.10   The Two Greatest Commandments

MT 22:34-40

        34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the
Sadducees, they gathered together. 35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked
him a question, to test him. 36 "Teacher, which is the great
commandment in the Law?" 37 Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the
Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
your mind.' 38 This is the great and first commandment. 39 And the
second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 On
these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."

MK 12:28-34

        28 And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with
one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him,
"Which commandment is the first of all?" 29 Jesus answered, "The first
is: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. 30 And you shall
love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your mind, and with all your strength.' 31 The second is this:
'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other
commandment greater than these." 32 And the scribe said to him, "You
are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no
other but he; 33 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the
understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as
oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
34 And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are
not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared to ask
him any question.

89.10   Christ the Son and also the Lord of David

MT 22:41-46

        41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
42 "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to
him, "The son of David." 43 He said to them, "How is it then that
David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord', saying,
44      'The Lord said to my Lord,
        "Sit at my right hand,
                till I put your enemies under your feet"'?
45 If David then calls him 'Lord,' how is he his son?" 46 And no one
was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to
ask him any more questions.

MK 12:35-37

        35 And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, "How is it that
the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? 36 David himself,
speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared:
        'The Lord said to my Lord:
        "Sit at my right hand
                till I put your enemies under your feet."'
37 Therefore David himself calls him 'Lord'; how is he then his son?"
And the common people heard him gladly.

LK 20:41-44

        41 And he said to them, "How can they say that the Christ is the
Son of David? 42 For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,
        'The Lord said to my Lord,
        "Sit at my right hand,
43              till I make your enemies
                        a footstool for your feet."'
44 David therefore calls him 'Lord,' and how is he his son?"

90.10   Jesus Condemns the Hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees.
        He Laments over Jerusalem.

MT 23:1-39

        1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 "The
scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. 3 So you must observe and
do whatever they tell you. But do not do what they do; for they preach,
but do not practice. 4 They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay
them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with
their finger. 5 But they do all their works to be seen by men; for they
make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long. 6
And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the
synagogues, 7 and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by
men, 'Rabbi.' 8 But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only
one Master, and you are all brethren. 9 And do not call anyone on earth
your 'Father,' for you have one Father, he who is in heaven. 10 Nor are
you to be called 'Teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. 11 He
who is greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 For whoever exalts
himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
        13 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter
yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in.
        15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
travel land and sea to win a single proselyte, and when he becomes one,
you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
        16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If any one swears by the
temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple,
he is bound by his oath.' 17 You blind fools! For which is greater, the
gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? 18 And you say, 'If
anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by
the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.' 19 You blind men! For
which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 20
Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on
it. 21 And he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who
dwells in it. 22 And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of
God and by him who sits on it.
        23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay
tithe of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier
matters of the Law, justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to
have done, without neglecting the others. 24 You blind guides, who
strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
        25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are
full of extortion and self-indulgence. 26 Blind Pharisee! First cleanse
the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean
also. 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are
like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful, but inside
they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. 28 Even so you
also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of
hypocrisy and lawlessness.
        29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build
the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, 30
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would
not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
31 Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who
murdered the prophets. 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers'
guilt. 33 You serpents! You brood of vipers, how are you to escape
being sentenced to hell? 34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men
and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will
scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, 35 that on
you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood
of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you
murdered between the temple and the altar. 36 Truly, I say to you, all
this will come upon this generation.
        37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone
those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your
children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you
were not willing! 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. 39 For
I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

MK 12:38-40

        38 And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like
to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market
places 39 and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor
at feasts, 40 who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long
prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."

LK 20:45-47, 13:34-35

        45 And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his
disciples,
46 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love
greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and
the places of honor at feasts, 47 who devour widows' houses and for a
pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation."
        34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone
those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your
children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you
were not willing! 35 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I
tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord!'"

91.10   The Widow's Coin

MK 12:41-44

        41 And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the
multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich
put in large sums. 42 And a poor widow came, and put in two copper
coins, which make a penny. 43 And he called his disciples to him, and
said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more
than all


those who are contributing to the treasury. 44 For they all put in out
of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything-all
she had to live on."

LK 21:1-4

        1 He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the
treasury, 2 and he also saw a poor widow put in two copper coins. 3 So
he said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of
the others; 4 for these all contributed out of their abundance, but she
out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on."

92.10   Jesus Foretells His Death on the Cross

JN 12:20-50

        20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to
worship at the Feast. 21 Then they came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." 22
Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
23 Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be
glorified. 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls
into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces
much fruit. 25 He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his
life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 If anyone serves
me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also.
If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor.
        27 "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save
me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I came to this hour. 28
Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have
glorified it, and I will glorify it again." 29 The crowd standing by
heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has
spoken to him." 30 Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake,
not for mine. 31 Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of
this world will be cast out. 32 And I, when I am lifted up from the
earth, will draw all men to myself." 33 He said this to show by what
death he was to die. 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the
Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, 'The Son of
Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?" 35 Then Jesus said to
them, "A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have
the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness
does not know where he is going. 36 While you have the light, believe
in the light, that you may become sons of light."
        When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.
37 Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not
believe in him; 38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be
fulfilled, which he spoke:
        "Lord, who has believed our report?
                And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
39 Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
40      "He has blinded their eyes
                and hardened their hearts,
        lest they should see with their eyes,
                and understand with their hearts and turn,
        so that I should heal them."
41 Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him. 42
Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of
the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of
the synagogue; 43 for they loved the praise of men more than the praise
of God.
        44 Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me,
believes not in me but in him who sent me. 45 And he who sees me sees
him who sent me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever
believes in me should not remain in darkness. 47 If anyone hears my
words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to
judge the world but to save the world. 48 He who rejects me and does
not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will
condemn him on the last day. 49 For I have not spoken on my own
authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say
and what to speak. 50 And I know that his command is eternal life.
Whatever I say, therefore, I say just as the Father has told me."

93.10   Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple and the Signs of
the
        Day of Judgment.

MT 24:1-51

        1 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples
came up to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he
answered them, "You see all these things, do you not? Truly, I say to
you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not
be thrown down."
        3 Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to
him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will this be? And what will be
the
sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?" 4 And Jesus answered
them: "Take heed that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my
name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. 6 And you will
hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed; for all
these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will
be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the
beginning of birth pains. 9 Then they will deliver you up to
tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations
for my name's sake. 10 And then many will fall away, and will betray
one another, and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets will rise
up and deceive many. 12 And because wickedness will increase, the love
of most will grow cold. 13 But he who endures to the end will be saved.
14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world
as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
        15 "So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination
of desolation,' spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader
understand) 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
17 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of
his house. 18 And let him who is in the field not go back to get his
clothes. 19 But woe for those who are pregnant and for those who are
nursing babies in those days! 20 Pray that your flight may not be in
winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation,
such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and
never will be. 22 And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh
would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be
shortened. 23 Then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'
or 'There he is!' do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false
prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if
possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand. 26 So if
they say to you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or,
'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 27 For as the
lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the
coming of the Son of Man be. 28 Wherever the carcass is, there the
eagles will be gathered together.
        29 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days
        the sun will be darkened,
                and the moon will not give its light;
        the stars will fall from heaven,
                and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all
the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man
coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he
will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather
together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the
other.
        32 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its
branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer
is near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that it is
near, right at the door. 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will
not pass away till all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth
will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
        36 "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of
heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. 37 But as the days of Noah
were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the
days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and
they did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also
will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the
field; one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be
grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch
therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But
know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what time of the
night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have
let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for
the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
        45 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master
has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
46 Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so
doing. 47 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his
possessions. 48 But if that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My
master is staying away a long time,' 49 and he then begins to beat his
fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the master
of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at
an hour he is not aware of, 51 and he will cut him to pieces and assign
him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

MK 13:1-37

        1 And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to
him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful
buildings!" 2 And Jesus said to him, "Do you see all these great
buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that
will not be thrown down."
        3 Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,
Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 4 "Tell us, when
will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be
fulfilled?" 5 And Jesus began to say to them: "Take heed that no one
deceives you. 6 Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and will
deceive many. 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be
alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet. 8 For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will
be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and
troubles. These are the beginning of birth pains. 9 But watch out for
yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be
beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before governors and
kings for my sake, for a testimony to them. 10 And the gospel must
first be preached to all nations. 11 And when they bring you to trial
and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand what you are to say. But
say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak,
but the Holy Spirit. 12 Brother will betray brother to death, and a
father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have
them put to death. 13 And you will be hated by all men for my name's
sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
        14 "When you see 'the abomination of desolation' standing where
it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are
in Judea flee to the mountains. 15 Let him who is on the housetop not
go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house. 16
And let him who is in the field not go back to get his cloak. 17 But
woe for those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in
those days! 18 Pray that it may not happen in winter. 19 For in those
days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning
of the creation which God created until now, and never will be. 20 And
if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but
for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days. 21
Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, he
is there!' do not believe it. 22 For false christs and false prophets
will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the
elect. 23 But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand.
        24 "But in those days, after that tribulation,
        the sun will be darkened,
                and the moon will not give its light;
25      the stars will fall from heaven,
                and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great
power and glory. 27 And then he will send out his angels, and gather
his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends
of heaven.
        28 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its
branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer
is near. 29 So also, when you see these things happening, you know that
it is near, right at the door. 30 Truly, I say to you, this generation
will not pass away before all these things take place. 31 Heaven and
earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
        32 "But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the
angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 33 Take heed,
watch; for you do not know when the time will come. 34 It is like a man
going on a journey, when he leaves his house and puts his servants in
charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the
watch. 35 Watch therefore-for you do not know when the master of the
house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster
crows, or in the morning-36 lest, coming suddenly, he find you
sleeping. 37 And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!"

LK 21:5-36

        5 And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with
beautiful stones and offerings, he said, 6 "As for these things which
you
see, the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone
upon
another that will not be thrown down."
        7 So they asked him, "Teacher, when will these things be? And
what will be the sign when they are about to take place?" 8 And he
said: "Take heed that you not are deceived. For many will come in my
name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not go after them.
9 And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified; for
these things must first take place, but the end will not come
immediately." 10 Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great
earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there
will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven. 12 But before all
this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering
you up to the synagogues and prisons. And you will be brought before
kings and governors for my name's sake. 13 This will turn into an
opportunity for you to bear testimony. 14 Therefore settle it in your
minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer; 15 for I will
give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able
to resist or contradict. 16 You will be betrayed even by parents and
brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to
death. 17 You will be hated by all for my name's sake. 18 But not a
hair of your head will perish. 19 By your endurance you will gain your
lives.
        20 "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then
know that its desolation is near. 21 Then let those in Judea flee to
the
mountains, let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who
are out in the country enter it. 22 For these are days of vengeance, to
fulfil all that is written. 23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to
those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great
distress in the land and wrath upon this people. 24 They will fall by
the edge of the sword, and be led captive to all nations. Jerusalem
will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled.
        25 "There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the
earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and
the waves, 26 men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming
on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 27 Then
they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great
glory. 28 Now when these things begin to take place, look up and lift
up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
        29 He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the
trees. 30 When they are sprouting, you see and know for yourselves that
summer is already near. 31 So you also, when you see these things
happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 32 Truly, I say to
you, this generation will not pass away till all things take place. 33
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
        34 "But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down
with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that Day
come on you unexpectedly like a trap. 35 For it will come upon all
those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. 36 Watch at all times,
and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things
that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."

93.20   The Parables of the ten Virgins and the Five Talents.
        Separation of the Good and Evil at the Judgment.

MT 25:1-46

        1 "Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who
took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them
were foolish, and five were wise. 3 For when the foolish took their
lamps, they took no oil with them; 4 but the wise took oil in their
flasks with their lamps. 5 While the bridegroom was delayed, they all
slumbered and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a cry: 'Behold, the
bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' 7 Then all those virgins rose and
trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some
of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 9 But the wise replied, 'No,
there may not be enough for both us and you; go rather to those who
sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' 10 And while they went to buy,
the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the
wedding; and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other virgins came
also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us!'  12 But he replied, 'Truly, I
say to you, I do not know you.' 13 Therefore keep watch, for you know
neither the day nor the hour.
        14 "For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his
servants and entrusted his property to them. 15 To one he gave five
talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his
ability. Then he went on his journey. 16 He who had received the five
talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents
more. 17 So also, he who had the two talents gained two more. 18 But he
who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground, and hid his
master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants
came and settled accounts with them. 20 So he who had received the five
talents came and brought five other talents, saying, 'Master, you
delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents.'
21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you
have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many
things. Enter into the joy of your master.' 22 He also who had received
the two talents came and said, 'Master, you delivered to me two
talents; look, I have gained two more talents.' 23 His master said to
him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over
a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the
joy of your master.' 24 Then he who had received the one talent came
and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have
not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was
afraid, and went and hid your talent in the
ground. Here you have what is yours.' 26 But his master answered him,
'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not
sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Then you ought to
have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would
have received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take the talent
from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. 29 For to every
one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from
him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast
the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.'
        31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels
with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations
will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will put
the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the
King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you blessed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world: 35 for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you
gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, 36 I was naked and
you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you
came to me.' 37 Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we
see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 When did
we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? 39 When
did we see you sick or


in prison and go to visit you?' 40 And the King will answer them,
'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my
brethren, you did it to me.'
        41 "Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me,
you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and
his angels: 42 for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty
and you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not take me
in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not
visit me.' 44 Then they also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you
hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did
not minister to you?' 45 Then he will answer them, 'Truly, I say to
you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do
it to me.'  46 And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life."


Part 12 - TREACHERY

94.10   The Jews in Authority seek to Destroy Jesus Privately

MT 26:1-5

        1 When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his
disciples, 2 "You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son
of Man will be delivered up to be crucified." 3 Then the chief priests
and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high
priest, who was called Caiaphas, 4 and they plotted to arrest Jesus by
stealth and kill him. 5 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest
there be a riot among the people."

LK 22:1-2

        1 Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called
the Passover. 2 And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how
to kill him, for they feared the people.

94.20   They Conspire with Judas Iscariot

MT 26:14-16

        14 One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the
chief priests 15 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I
deliver him to you?" And they counted out to him thirty pieces of
silver. 16 And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.

MK 14:10-11

        10 Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests
to betray him to them. 11 And when they heard it they were glad, and
promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.

LK 22:3-6

        3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered of
the twelve. 4 So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests
and officers, how he might betray him to them. 5 And they were glad,
and agreed to give him money. 6 So he consented, and sought an
opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.



95.10   The Disciples Prepare the Passover

MT 26:17-19

        17 Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare for
you to eat the Passover?" 18 He said, "Go into the city to a certain
man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep
the Passover at your house with my disciples.'" 19 So the disciples did
as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.

MK 14:12-16

        12 Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the
Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where do you want us to go
and prepare for you to eat the Passover?" 13 And he sent two of his
disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a
jar of water will meet you; follow him. 14 And wherever he enters, say
to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, where is my guest room,
where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 15 He will show you a
large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there."
16 So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it just as
he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.

LK 22:7-13

        7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover
lamb had to be sacrificed. 8 So he sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and
prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat." 9 They said to him,
"Where do you want us to prepare it?" 10 He said to them, "Behold, when
you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you;
follow him into the house which he enters. 11 And say to the owner of
the house, 'The Teacher says to you: Where is the guest room, where I
may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 12 He will show you a large,
furnished upper room; there make ready." 13 So they went, and found it
just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.

95.20   Jesus Foretells the Treachery of Judas

MT 26:20-29

        20 When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve. 21
And as they were eating, he said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will
betray me." 22 And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him
one after another, "Is it I, Lord?" 23 He answered, "He who has dipped
his hand in the dish with me will betray me. 24 The Son of Man goes
just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of
Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not
been born." 25 Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, "Rabbi, is
it I?" He said to him, "You have said it."
        26 Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my
body." 27 Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, "Drink from it, all of you. 28 For this is my blood of the
covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29
I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on
until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

MK 14:17-25

17 And when it was evening he came with the twelve. 18 And as they were
at table eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will
betray me, one who is eating with me." 19 They began to be sorrowful,
and to say to him one by one, "Is it I?" 20 He said to them, "It is one
of the twelve, one who dips bread into the dish with me. 21 For the Son
of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom
the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if
he had not been born."
        22 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke
it, and gave it to them and said, "Take; this is my body." 23 Then he
took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they
all drank from it. 24 And he said to them, "This is my blood of the
covenant, which is poured out for many. 25 Truly, I say to you, I will
not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new
in the kingdom of God."

LK 22:14-23

        14 When the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with
him. 15 And he said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer; 16 for I tell you, I will not eat it
again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." 17 Then he took the
cup, and gave thanks, and said, "Take this and divide it among
yourselves; 18 for I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the
vine until the kingdom of God comes." 19 And he took bread, gave thanks
and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is
given for you; do this in remembrance of me." 20 Likewise he took the
cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood,
which is poured out for you. 21 But behold the hand of him who betrays
me is with me on the table. 22 For the Son of Man goes as it has been
determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!" 23 Then they
began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do
this.

95.40   Jesus Reproves the Ambition of the Apostles,
        Foretells Peter's Denials, Gives Warning of coming Privation and        Peril

LK 22:24-38

        24 A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be
considered the greatest. 25 And he said to them, "The kings of the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those who exercise authority
over them are called benefactors. 26 But not so among you; on the
contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and
he who leads as one who serves. 27 For who is greater, one who sits at
the table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table?
But I am among you as One who serves. 28 You are those who have
continued with me in my trials. 29 And I bestow on you a kingdom, just
as my Father bestowed one on me, 30 so that you may eat and drink at my
table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.
        31 "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you, that he
might sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith
may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your
brethren." 33 But he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to
prison and to death." 34 He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will
not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me."
        35 And he said to them, "When I sent you out with no purse or bag
or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing." 36 He said to
them, "But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag;
and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one. 37 For I tell
you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, 'And he was numbered
with transgressors'; for what is written about me has its fulfillment."
38 They said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." And he said to them,
"It is enough."

95.50   Jesus Washes the Feet of His Disciples

JN 13:1b-20

        1 When Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this
world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he
loved them to the end. 2 And during supper, when the devil had already
put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, 3
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
that he had come from God and was going to God, 4 rose from supper,
laid aside his garments, took a towel and girded himself. 5 After that,
he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and
to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 6 Then he came to
Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my
feet?" 7 Jesus answered him, "You do not realize now what I am doing,
but later you will understand." 8 Peter said to him, "You shall never
wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no
part with me." 9 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but
also my hands and my head!" 10 Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed
needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are
clean, but not every one of you." 11 For he knew who was to betray him;
that was why he said, "You are not all clean."
        12 When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and
returned to his place, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done
to you? 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I
am. 14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you
also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have given you an
example, that you should do as I have done to you. 16 Truly, truly, I
say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is
sent greater than he who sent him. 17 If you know these things, blessed
are you if you do them. 18 I am not speaking of you all. I know whom I
have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'he who ate my
bread has lifted up his heel against me.' 19 Now I tell you before it
comes, that when it does take place, you may believe that I am he. 20
Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives anyone I send receives me;
and he who receives me receives him who sent me."

95.60   Jesus Gives the Sop to Judas, who then goes out.
        Exhortation to love one another.
        Jesus a Second Time Foretells Peter's Denials

JN 13:21-38

        21 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me." 22
The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. 23 One
of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning close to the breast of
Jesus. 24 Simon Peter motioned to him and said, "Ask who it is of whom
he speaks." 25 Then, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, he said to
him, "Lord, who is it?" 26 Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I shall
give this piece of bread when I have dipped it." And having dipped the
bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 27 Then after
the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "What you are
going to do, do quickly." 28 But no one at the table knew why he said
this to him. 29 Some thought that, because Judas had the money box,
Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast"; or, that he
should give something to the poor. 30 Having received the piece of
bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.
        31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man
glorified, and in him God is glorified. 32 If God is glorified in him,
God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. 33
Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will
seek me; and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot
come,' so now I say to you. 34 A new commandment I give to you, that
you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one
another. 35 By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you
have love for one another."
        36 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus
answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall
follow afterward." 37 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow
you now? I will lay down my life for you." 38 Jesus answered, "Will you
lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will
not crow, till you have denied me three times.

95.70   The Holy Ghost is Promised. Jesus Prays for His Disciples

JN 14:1-17:26

        1 "Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also
in me. 2 In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that
where I am you may be also. 4 And you know the way where I am going." 5
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going, and how
can we know the way?" 6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the
truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If
you had known me, you would have known my Father also; and from now on
you know him and have seen him." 8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us
the Father, and that will be enough for us." 9 Jesus said to him, "Have
I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has
seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10
Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The
words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the
Father who dwells in me does his works. 11 Believe me that I am in the
Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the
works themselves. 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me
will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he
do, because I go to the Father. 13 And whatever you ask in my name, I
will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask
anything in my name, I will do it.
        15 "If you love me, you will keep my commandments. 16 And I will
ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you
forever - 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it neither sees him nor knows him; but you know him, for he
dwells with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you orphans; I
will come to you. 19 A little while longer, and the world will see me
no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also. 20 In
that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in
you. 21 He who has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves
me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him
and manifest myself to him." 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him,
"Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the
world?" 23 Jesus answered him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my
word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our
home with him. 24 He who does not love me does not keep my words; and
the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
        25 "These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you.
26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my
name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all
that I have said to you. 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to
you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be
troubled, neither let them be afraid. 28 You have heard me say to you,
'I am going away and coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would
rejoice because I said, 'I am going to the Father,' for the Father is
greater than I. 29 And now I have told you before it takes place, so
that when it does take place, you may believe. 30 I will no longer talk
much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has
nothing in me. 31 But I do as the Father commanded me, so that the
world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here.
15
        1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every
branch in me that bears no fruit he takes away; and every branch that
does bear fruit he prunes, so that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are
already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 4 Abide
in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless
it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am
the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he
bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone
does not abide in me, he is like a branch that is cast away and
withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and
burned. 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever
you will, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this my Father is
glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. 9
As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; abide in my love. 10
If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have
kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
        11 "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you,
and that your joy may be full. 12 This is my commandment, that you love
one another as I have loved you. 13 Greater love has no one than this,
that he lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you
do what I command you. 15 No longer do I call you servants, for a
servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you
friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to
you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that
you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that
whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. 17 This I
command you, that you love one another.
        18 "If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated
you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But
because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world,
therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you,
'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they
will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours
also. 21 But all this they will do to you for my name's sake, because
they do not know him who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their
sin. 23 He who hates me hates my Father also. 24 If I had not done
among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin;
but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. 25 But this is
to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me
without a cause.'
        26 "But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from
the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will
testify of me. 27 And you also will bear witness, because you have been
with me from the beginning.
16
        1 "I have said all this to you so that you will not go astray. 2
They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming when
whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. 3 And they
will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. 4
But I have told you these things, that when the time comes, you may
remember that I told you of them.


        "I did not say these things to you at the beginning, because I
was with you. 5 But now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you
asks me, 'Where are you going?' 6 But because I have said these things
to you, sorrow has filled your heart. 7 Nevertheless I tell you the
truth: it is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do not go away,
the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to
you. 8 And when he comes, he will convict the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment: 9 of sin, because they do not believe
in me; 10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you see me
no more; 11 of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
        12 "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear
them now. 13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you
into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but
whatever he hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to come.
14 He will glorify me, for he will take of what is mine and declare it
to you. 15 All that the Father has is mine. Therefore I said that he
will take of what is mine and declare it to you.
        16 "A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little
while, and you will see me." 17 Then some of his disciples said to one
another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you
will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'; and,
'because I go to the Father'?" 18 They said, "What does he mean by 'a
little while'? We do not know what he is saying." 19 Now Jesus knew
that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, "Are you asking
yourselves about what I meant when I said, 'A little while, and you
will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me'? 20
Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world
will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into
joy. 21 When a woman is in labor she has sorrow, because her hour has
come; but as soon as she gives birth to the child, she no longer
remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been born into the
world. 22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your
heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. 23 In that
day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you
ask the Father in my name he will give you. 24 Until now you have asked
nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be
full.
        25 "I have said this to you in figurative language; but the time
is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but I will
tell you plainly about the Father. 26 In that day you will ask in my
name. And I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; 27
for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have
believed that I came from God. 28 I came from the Father and have come
into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father."
29 His disciples said, "See, now you are speaking plainly, and not
using a figure of speech! 30 Now we are sure that you know all things,
and have no need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that
you came from God." 31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? 32
Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, when you will be
scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. And yet I am not
alone, for the Father is with me. 33 I have said these things to you,
that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation.
But take courage! I have overcome the world."
17
        1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and said: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that
your Son also may glorify you, 2 as you have given him authority over
all flesh, that he should give eternal life to all those you have given
him. 3 And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. 4 I have glorified you on the
earth, having finished the work which you have given me to do. 5 And
now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had
with you before the world was made.
        6 "I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given me
out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me, and they have
kept your word. 7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes
from you. 8 For I have given them the words which you have given me,
and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and
they have believed that you sent me. 9 I pray for them. I am not
praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they
are yours. 10 And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am
glorified in them. 11 And now I am no longer in the world, but they are
in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your
name - the name you gave me - that they may be one, even as we are one.
12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name - the name you gave
me. I have guarded them, and none of them is lost except the son of
perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 13 But now I am
coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may
have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 14 I have given them your word;
and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world. 15 I do not pray that you should take them out
of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil one. 16 They
are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 17 Sanctify them
by the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you sent me into the world, I
also have sent them into the world. 19 And for their sakes I sanctify
myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.
        20 "I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will
believe in me through their word; 21 that they all may be one, as you,
Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us, that the
world may believe that you sent me. 22 And the glory which you gave me
I have given them, that they may be one just as we are one: 23 I in
them, and you in me; that they may become perfectly one, and that the
world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them even as you
have loved me. 24 Father, I desire that they also whom you have given
me may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which you
have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. 25
O righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you;
and these know that you sent me. 26 I have made known to them your
name, and will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may
be in them, and I in them."

96.10   Jesus Warns His Disciples that they will Forsake Him.
        He Foretells Peter's Denials a Third Time.

MT 26:30-35

        30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of
Olives.
        31 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me
this night; for it is written,
        'I will strike the shepherd,
                and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
32 But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee." 33
Peter declared to him, "Even if all fall away because of you, I will
never fall away." 34 Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, this very
night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." 35
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny
you." And so said all the disciples.

MK 14:26-31

        26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of
Olives.
        27 And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away; for it is
written:
        'I will strike the shepherd,
                and the sheep will be scattered.'
28 But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee." 29
Peter said to him, "Even if all fall away, I will not." 30 Jesus said
to him, "Truly, I say to you that this very night, before the rooster
crows twice, you will deny me three times." 31 But he spoke more
vehemently, "If I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And they
all said the same.


96.20   The Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane

MT 26:36-46

        36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called
Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and
pray." 37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and
he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, "My
soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with
me." 39 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, "O
my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless,
not as I will, but as you will." 40 Then he came to the disciples and
found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch
with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." 42
Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, "O my Father, if this
cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done." 43 And
again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So
he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the
same words. 45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you
still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of
Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be
going; see, my betrayer is at hand."

MK 14:32-42

        32 They went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said
to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray." 33 And he took Peter, James
and John with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
34 And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; stay
here, and watch." 35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground
and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 36
And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this
cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what you will." 37 Then he
came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you
asleep? Could you not watch one hour? 38 Watch and pray that you may
not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh
is weak." 39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
40 And when he came again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were
heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. 41 Then he came the
third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? It is
enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed
into the hands of sinners. 42 Rise, let us go; see, my betrayer is at
hand."

LK 22:39-46

        39 He came out, and went to the Mount of Olives, as was his
custom, and his disciples followed him. 40 When he came to the place,
he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation." 41 And
he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,
42 "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not
my will, but yours, be done." 43 An angel appeared to him from heaven,
and strengthened him. 44 And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly,
and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. 45 When
he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping
from sorrow. 46 He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that
you may not enter into temptation."

JN 18:1-2

        1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his
disciples over the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he
and his disciples entered. 2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the
place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples.

96.30   Jesus Betrayed by Judas Iscariot and Arrested.
        The Disciples Desert Him.

MT 26:47-56

        47 While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve,
and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief
priests and the elders of the people. 48 Now the betrayer had given
them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is the man; seize him." 49 And at
once he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came up and
laid hands on Jesus and seized him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who
were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 52 But Jesus said to
him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will
perish by the sword. 53 Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father,
and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But
how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this
way?" 55 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as
against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat
in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. 56 But all this has
taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."
Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.

MK 14:43-52

        43 And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one
of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the
chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 44 Now the betrayer had
given them a signal, saying, "The one I shall kiss is the man; seize
him and lead him away under guard." 45 And when he came, he went up to
him at once, and said, "Rabbi!" and he kissed him. 46 And they laid
hands on him and seized him. 47 And one of those who stood by drew his
sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
48 And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a robber, with
swords and clubs to capture me? 49 Every day I was with you in the
temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But the scriptures must be
fulfilled." 50 Then they all forsook him and fled.
        51 And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth
around his body. And they seized him, 52 and he left the linen cloth
and fled from them naked.

LK 22:47-53

        47 While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was
called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to
Jesus to kiss him; 48 but Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying
the Son of Man with a kiss?" 49 When those around him saw what was
going to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?" 50
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his
right ear. 51 But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched his
ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers
of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, "Have you come out
as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 53 When I was with you day
after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your
hour, and the power of darkness."

JN 18:3-12

3 So Judas, having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers
from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns,
torches, and weapons. 4 Then Jesus, knowing all that was to come upon
him, went forward and said to them, "Whom do you seek?" 5 They answered
him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am he." And Judas, who
betrayed him, was standing with them. 6 When he said to them, "I am
he," they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 Again he asked them,
"Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." 8 Jesus
answered, "I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men
go." 9 This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be
fulfilled, "Of those whom you gave me I have lost none." 10 Then Simon
Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant,
and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 11 Jesus
said to Peter, "Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the
cup which the Father has given me?"
        12 Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the
officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.

96.40   Jesus is Brought Before Annas

MT 26:57

        57 And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.

MK 14:53

        53 And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief
priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.

LK 22:54

        54 Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the
high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance.

JN 18:13-14

13 And they led him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of
Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 Now it was Caiaphas who had
advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the
people.

96.50   The Denials of Peter

MT  26:58, 69-75

        58 But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the
courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards
to see the end.
        69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant
girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee." 70
But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are
talking about."  71 And when he went out to the gateway, another girl
saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of
Nazareth." 72 But again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the
man!" 73 After a little while those who stood by came up and said to
Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you."
74 Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not
know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed. 75 And Peter
remembered the word Jesus had said, "Before the rooster crows, you will
deny me three times." So he went out and wept bitterly.

MK 14:54, 66-72

        54 But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard
of the high priest. And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at
the fire.
        66 Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant
girls of the high priest came. 67 And when she saw Peter warming
himself, she looked at him, and said, "You also were with the Nazarene,
Jesus." 68 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand
what you mean." And he went out into the gateway. 69 And the servant
girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, "This is
one of them." 70 But again he denied it. And after a little while again
those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them; for you
are a Gallilean." 71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to
swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak." 72 And immediately
the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus
had said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me
three times." And he broke down and wept.

LK 22:55-62

        55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard
and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 56 And a servant girl,
seeing him as he sat in the firelight, looked at him, and said, "This
man also was with him." 57 But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not
know him." 58 And a little later some one else saw him and said, "You
also are of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not!" 59 Then after about
an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, "Certainly this fellow
also was with him, for he is a Galilean." 60 But Peter said, "Man, I do
not know what you are saying!" Immediately, while he was still
speaking, the rooster crowed. 61 And the Lord turned and looked at
Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to
him, "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times." 62
And he went out and wept bitterly.

JN 18:15-27

        15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As
this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the
courtyard of the high priest. 16 But Peter stood at the door outside.
Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and
spoke to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in. 17 Then the
girl who kept the door said to Peter, "You are not also one of this
man's disciples, are you?" He said, "I am not." 18 Now the servants and
officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were
standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and
warming himself.
        19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and
his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the
world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the
Jews come together, and I have said nothing in secret. 21 Why do you
ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what
I said." 22 And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by
struck Jesus with his hand, saying, "Is that the way you answer the
high priest?" 23 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear
witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike
me?" 24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
        25 Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to
him, "You are not also one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it and
said, "I am not." 26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative
of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the
garden with him?" 27 Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster
crowed.

96.60   Jesus is Arraigned Before Caiaphas, Condemned and Mocked

MT 26:59-68

        59 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false
testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, 60 but they
found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came
forward 61 and said, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the
temple of God, and to build it in three days.'" 62 And the high priest
stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these
men testify against you?" 63 But Jesus remained silent. And the high
priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us
if you are the Christ, the Son of God." 64 Jesus said to him, "It is as
you said. But I say to you,
        hereafter you will see the Son of Man
                sitting at the right hand of the Power,
                and coming on the clouds of heaven."
65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken
blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard
his blasphemy. 66 What do you think?" They answered, "He is worthy of
death." 67 Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists;
and others slapped him, 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the
one who struck you?"

MK 14:55-65

55 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against
Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. 56 For many bore false
witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree. 57 Then some
stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, 58 "We heard him
say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three
days I will build another not made with hands.'" 59 Yet even then their
testimony did not agree. 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst,
and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men
testify against you?" 61 But he was silent and made no answer. Again
the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the
Blessed?" 62 And Jesus said, "I am.
        And you will see the Son of Man
                sitting at the right hand of the Power,
                and coming with the clouds of heaven."
63 The high priest tore his clothes and said, "Why do we need any more
witnesses? 64 You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" And
they all condemned him as worthy of death. 65 Then some began to spit
on him, and to blindfold him, and to beat him, and to say to him,
"Prophesy!" And the guards received him with slaps in the face.

LK 22:63-65

        63 Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him. 64
They blindfolded him and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you?" 65 And they spoke many other things against him,
blaspheming.



97.10   Jesus Condemned Before Caiaphas and led to Pilate

MT 27:1-2

        1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the
people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. 2 And they bound
him, and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.

MK 15:1

        1 Very early in the morning, the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and
they bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

LK 22:66-23:1

        66 As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people
came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to
their council chamber, saying, 67 "If you are the Christ, tell us." But
he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe. 68 And if I ask
you, you will not answer. 69 But from now on the Son of Man will be
seated at the right hand of the power of God." 70 They all said, "Are
you the Son of God, then?" He said to them, "You said what I am." 71
And they said, "What further testimony do we need? We have heard it
ourselves from his own lips."
        1 Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate.

JN 18:28

        28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it
was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so
that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.

97.20   The Jews Accuse Jesus of Sedition

LK 23:2

        2 And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man
perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying
that he himself is Christ, a king."



JN 18:29-33a

         29 So Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation do you
bring against this man?" 30 They answered him, "If he were not an
evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you." 31 Pilate said to
them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." The Jews
said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death." 32 This
happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing
by what death he was going to die. 33 Then Pilate entered the
Praetorium again.

97.30   The Remorse and Suicide of Judas Iscariot

MT 27:3-10

        3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he
repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief
priests and the elders, 4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent
blood." And they said, "What is that to us? You see to it!" 5 Then he
threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went
and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are
the money of blood." 7 So they took counsel, and bought with them the
potter's field, to bury strangers in.  Therefore that field has been
called the Field of Blood to this day. 9 Then was fulfilled what was
spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty
pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some
of the sons of Israel, 10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as
the Lord directed me."

Acts 1:18b

        18 (Now this man bought a field with the reward of his
wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his intestines gushed out. 19 And it became known to all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their
language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)

Part 13 - TRIAL BEFORE PILATE

98.10   Trial Before Pilate

MT 27:11-14

        11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked
him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" So Jesus said to him, "It is as
you say." 12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,
he made no answer. 13 Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how
many things they testify against you?" 14 But he gave him no answer,
not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.

MK 15:2-5

        2 Then Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he
answered him, "It is as you say." 3 And the chief priests accused him
of many things.4 And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to
make? See how many things they bring against you." 5 But Jesus still
made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed.

LK 23:3-7

        3 So Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He
answered him, "It is as you say." 4 Then Pilate said to the chief
priests and the crowd, I find no crime in this man." 5 But they were
urgent, saying, "He stirs upthe people, teaching throughout all Judea,
from Galilee to this place."
        6 When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 7
And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent
him to Herod, who also was in Jerusalem at that time.

JN 18:33b-38

        33 Then Pilate called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King
of the Jews?" 34 Jesus answered, "Do you say this on your own, or did
others say it to you about me?" 35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your
own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have
you done?" 36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my
kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should
not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here." 37
Pilate said to him, "You are a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say
what I am-a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into
the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth
hears my voice." 38 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"
        After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told
them, "I find no crime in him.

98.20   Trial Before Herod

LK 23:8-12

        8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had desired
to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he
hoped to see some miracle done by him. 9 Then he questioned him with
many words, but he gave him no answer. 10 The chief priests and the
scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. 11 And Herod with his
soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, dressing him
in a gorgeous robe, he sent him back to Pilate. 12 That very day Pilate
and Herod became friends with each other, for before this they had been
at enmity with each other.

98.30   Barabbas Preferred Before Jesus

MT 27:15-18, 20-23

        15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for
the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. 16 And at that time they
had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. 17 So when they had
gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you,
Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?" 18 For he knew it was out of
envy that they had handed him over. 20 But the chief priests and the
elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
21 The governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to
release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!" 22 Pilate said to them, "Then
what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let
him be crucified!" 23 And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But
they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!"

MK 15:6-14

        6 Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one
prisoner whom they requested. 7 And with the rebels in prison, who had
committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.
8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always
done for them. 9 But Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release
to you the King of the Jews?" 10 For he knew it was out of envy that
the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. 11 But the chief
priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas
instead. 12 And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with
the man whom you call the King of the Jews?" 13 And they cried out
again, "Crucify him!" 14 And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has
he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"

LK 23:13-23

        13 Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and
the people, 14 and said to them, "You have brought this man to me as
one who was inciting the people to rebellion. And behold, having
examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man
concerning those charges which you make against him; 15 neither did
Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has
been done by him; 16 I will therefore chastise him and release him." 18
But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us
Barabbas"- 19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection
in the city, and for murder. 20 Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate
addressed to them again. 21 But they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify
him!" 22 Then he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has he
done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore
chastise him and release him." 23 But they were insistent, demanding
with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.

JN 18:39-40

        39 But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at
the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the
Jews?" 40 Then they all cried again, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now
Barabbas was a robber.

98.40   Jesus Mocked as a King

MT 27:27-30

        27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the
Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him. 28 And they
stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 29 and when they had
twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his
right hand. And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying,
"Hail, King of the Jews!" 30 And they spat on him, and took the reed
and struck him on the head.

JN 19:2-3

        2 And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his
head, and they clothed him in a purple robe. 3 They came up to him,
saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and struck him with their hands.

98.50   Pilate Yields

JN 19:4-15

        4 Pilate went out again, and said to them, "See, I am bringing
him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him." 5 So
Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate
said to them, "Behold the man!" 6 When the chief priests and officers
saw him, they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to
them, "You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him." 7 The
Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to that law he ought
to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
        8 When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid, 9 and he
went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?"
But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 Pilate said to him, "You will not
speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and
power to crucify you?" 11 Jesus answered, "You would have no power over
me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who
delivered me to you has the greater sin." 12 From then on Pilate sought
to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you let this man go, you
are not Caesar's friend. Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself
against Caesar."
        13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat
down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but
in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the
Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your
King!" 15 But they cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify
him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief
priests answered, "We have no King but Caesar."

98.60   The Warning of Pilate's Wife

MT 27:19

        19 While he [Pilate] was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife
sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I
have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."

98.70   Pilate Washes His Hands

MT 27:24-26

        24 When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a
riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd,
saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves." 25
And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
26 Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus,
he delivered him to be crucified.

MK 15:15

        15 So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to
them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be
crucified.

LK 23:24-25

        24 So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.
25 And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for
insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered
up to their will.

98.80   Jesus Mocked Again

MK 15:16-19

        16 The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the
Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion. 17 And they
clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and
put it on him. 18 And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the
Jews!" 19 Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him;
and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.

98.90   Jesus Led Forth to Crucifixion

MT 27:31-32

        31 And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, put
his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
        32 Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.

MK 15:20-21

        20 And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off
him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify
him.
        21 Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father
of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing
by, to carry his cross.

LK 23:26-32

        26 And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who
was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it
behind Jesus. 27 And a great multitude of the people followed him, and
women who also mourned and lamented him. 28 But Jesus turning to them
said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for
yourselves and for your children. 29 For behold, the days are coming
when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore,
and the breasts that never nursed!'
30      Then they will begin to say to the mountains,
                'Fall on us!'
        and to the hills,
                'Cover us!'
31 For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen
when it is dry?"
        32 Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to
death.

JN 19:16-17a

        16 Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.
        So they took Jesus. 17 And he [went out] bearing his cross.



99.10   Jesus Crucified with the Two Thieves.
        Pilate's Superscription.
        The Casting of Lots.
        Jesus Commends His Mother to John.
        The Mockery.
        The Conversion of One of the Thieves. Darkness.

MT 27:33-45

        33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the
place of a skull), 34 they offered him wine to drink, mingled with
gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. 35 And when they
had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting
lots; 36 and sitting down, they kept watch over him there. 37 And they
put up over his head the charge written against him:

THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38 Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one
on the left. 39 And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging
their heads 40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build
it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down
from the cross." 41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and
elders, mocked him, saying, 42 "He saved others; he cannot save
himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the
cross, and we will believe in him. 43 He trusts in God; let God deliver
him now, if he desires him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" 44 And
the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same
way.
        45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was
darkness over all the land.

MK 15:22-33

        22 And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means
the place of a skull). 23 Then they offered him wine mingled with
myrrh, but he did not take it. 24 And when they crucified him,
        they divided his garments,
                casting lots for them
                        to determine what each man should take.
25 And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. 26 And the
inscription of the charge written against him read:

THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on
his left. 29 And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging
their heads, and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and
build it in three days, 30 save yourself, and come down from the
cross!" 31 So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with
the scribes, and said, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. 32 Let
the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we
may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled
him.
        33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.

LK 23:33-45a

        33 And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they
crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the
left. 34 Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do." And they divided his garments and cast lots. 35 And the
people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, "He
saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the
Chosen One." 36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering
him wine vinegar, 37 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save
yourself." 38 There was also an inscription written over him:

THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

        39 One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at
him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!" 40 But the
other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under
the same sentence of condemnation? 41 And we indeed justly, for we are
receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing
wrong." 42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your
kingdom." 43 And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you
will be with me in Paradise."
        44 It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over
the whole land until the ninth hour, 45 for the sun was darkened.

JN 19:17b-27

        17 [He} went out to a place called the Place of the Skull, which
is called in Hebrew, Golgotha. 18 There they crucified him, and two
others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. 19 Pilate
wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read:

JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20 Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was
crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin. 21 The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not
write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the
Jews.'" 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
        23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments,
and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the
tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 24 So
they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it,
whose it shall be." This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled
which says:
        "They divided my garments among them,
                and for my clothing they cast lots."
This is what the soldiers did. 25 By the cross of Jesus stood his
mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved
standing by, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!" 27 Then
he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the
disciple took her to his own home.

100.10 Jesus Dies

MT 27:46-50

        46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?" 47 When some of those standing there heard this, they
said, "This man is calling Elijah." 48 Immediately one of them ran and
took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed, and
offered it to him to drink. 49 The rest said, "Let him alone; let us
see if Elijah will come to save him." 50 And Jesus cried out again with
a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.

MK 15:34-37

        34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"-which means, "My God, my God, why have
you forsaken me?" 35 When some of those standing near heard this, they
said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah." 36 And one ran and filled a
sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to
drink, saying, "Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down."
37 And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.

LK 23:46

        46 And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into
your hands I commit my spirit." And having said this, he breathed his
last.

JN 19:28-30

        28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished, that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I thirst." 29 Now a vessel
full of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with
the vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 30 So when
Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished!" And he bowed
his head and gave up his spirit.

100.20 Portents. The Centurion's Witness. The Crowd of Onlookers.

MT 27:51-56

        51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from
top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; 52 the
tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen
asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his
resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 54 So
when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the
earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified, and
said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" 55 And many women were also
there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee,
ministering to him; 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother
of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

MK 15:38-41

        38 Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. 39 So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he
cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was
the Son of God!" 40 There were also women looking on from afar, among
whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of
Joses, and Salome, 41 who also followed him and ministered to him when
he was in Galilee; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.


LK 23:45b, 47-49

        45 The curtain of the temple was torn in two. 47 Now when the
centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, "Certainly
this was a righteous man!" 48 When all the multitudes who had gathered
to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their
breasts, and returned home. 49 But all his acquaintances, and the women
who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these
things.

101.10 The Side of Jesus is Pierced with a Spear

JN 19:31-37

        31 Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the
bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath
was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken away. 32 Then the soldiers came and broke
the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with
him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,
they did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers pierced his
side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35 He who
saw it has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he
tells the truth, that you also may believe. 36 For these things were
done that the scripture should be fulfilled, "Not one of his bones
shall be broken." 37 And again another scripture says, "They shall look
on him whom they have pierced."

101.20 A Nobleman (Joseph of Arimathea) Begs for the Body of Jesus and
        lays it in a new Tomb in a Garden nearby.

MT 27:57-60

        57 And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea,
named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus. 58 He
went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it
to be given to him. 59 When Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a
clean linen cloth, 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had
hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
tomb, and departed.

MK 15:42-46

        42 Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day,
that is, the day before the Sabbath, 43 Joseph of Arimathea, a
prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of
God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the
body of Jesus. 44 Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and
summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead. 45 And
when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the
body to Joseph. 46 Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and
wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn
out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

LK 23:50-54

        50 Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a
good and righteous man, 51 who had not consented to their decision and
deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting
for the kingdom of God. 52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the
body of Jesus. 53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth,
and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had
ever yet been laid. 54 It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was
about to begin.

JN 19:38-42

        38 After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,
but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take
away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and
took away his body. 39 And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by
night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a
hundred pounds. 40 So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in
strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in
the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. 42 So because
of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid
Jesus there.

101.30 The Faithful Women Prepare a Rich Ointment to Embalm the Body
        of Jesus.

MT 27:61

61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the
tomb.

MK 15:47

47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

LK 23:55-56

        55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw
the tomb, and how his body was laid. 56 Then they returned and prepared
spices and perfumes.

101.40 The Chief Priests are Suspicious. They Seal the Sepulchre.

MT 27:62-66

        62 The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief
priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate 63 and said, "Sir, we
remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, 'After three
days I will rise again.'  64 Therefore order that the tomb be made
secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal
him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' So the
last deception will be worse than the first." 65 Pilate said to them,
"You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how." 66
So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting
a guard.

Part 14 - THE TOMB

102.10 The Two Marys Buy Spice

MK 16:1

        1 Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and
anoint him.

102.20 They Visit the Sepulchre

MT 28:1

        1 Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to
dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.

MK 16:2

        2 And very early on the first day of the week, they [the women]
came to the tomb when the sun had risen.

LK 24:1

        1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to
the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

102.30 Many Dead are Seen to be Alive Again

MT 27:52-53

        52 the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who
had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his
resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

102.40 The Grave Opened by Angels

MT 28:2-4

        2 And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the
door, and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his


clothes were white as snow. 4 And the guards shook for fear of him, and
became like dead men.

102.50 The Women Find the Stone Rolled away.

MK 16:3-4

        3 And they [the women] asked each other, "Who will roll away the
stone from the door of the tomb for us?" 4 But when they looked up,
they saw that the stone, though it was very large, had been rolled
away.

LK 24:2

        2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

JN 20:1

        1 On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken
away from the tomb.

103.10 Peter and John, on Hearing Mary Magdalene's Report of the Empty  Tomb,
Investigate for Themselves.

JN 20:2-10

        2 So she [Mary Magdalene] ran, and came to Simon Peter and the
other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have
taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid
him." 3 Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were
going toward the tomb. 4 They both ran, but the other disciple outran
Peter and reached the tomb first. 5 And stooping to look in, he saw the
linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter
came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen
cloths lying there, 7 and the napkin that had been around his head, not
lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself. 8 Then
the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in; and he
saw and believed. 9 For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he
must rise from the dead. 10 Then the disciples went back to their
homes.


103.20 The Women at the Tomb See an Angel who Announces the
        Resurrection.

MT 28:5-7

        5 [The women entered the tomb] But the angel [who was sitting in
the tomb] said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you
seek Jesus who was crucified. 6 He is not here; for he has risen, as he
said. Come, see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his
disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going
before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told
you."

MK 16:5-7

        5 And entering the tomb, they [the women] saw a young man sitting
on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were alarmed. 6
But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where
they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going
before you to
Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you."

LK 24:3

        3 but when they [the women] went in they did not find the body of
the Lord Jesus.

103.30 Then Two Angels Greet the Women

LK 24:4-8

4 While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them
in dazzling apparel. 5 And as they were terrified and bowed their faces
to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among
the dead? 6 He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he told you
while he was still in Galilee, 7 'The Son of Man must be delivered into
the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise
again.'" 8 And they remembered his words.

103.40 They go to Tell the Disciples

MT 28:8

        8 So they [the women] departed quickly from the tomb with fear
and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

MK 16:8

        8 So they [the women] went out quickly and fled from the tomb,
for trembling and astonishment had gripped them. And they said nothing
to anyone, for they were afraid.

103.50 Two Angels, and then Jesus Himself, appear to Mary Magdalene
        as she Weeps at the Tomb

MK 16:9

        9 Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.

JN 20:11-17

        11 But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she
stooped to look into the tomb. 12 And she saw two angels in white,
sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other
at the feet. 13 They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She
said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know
where they have laid him." 14 Saying this, she turned around and saw
Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus
said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"
Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have
carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away." 16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned and said to him in
Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher). 17 Jesus said to her, "Do
not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my
brethren and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father,
to my God and your God.'"

104.10 Jesus Appears to the Other Women as they go to Announce the
        Resurrection

MT 28:9-10

        9 And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" And they came to
him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him. 10 Then Jesus said to
them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and
there they will see me."

105.10 The Jewish Authorities Bribe the Guard to Declare that Jesus'
        Disciples Stole His Body

MT 28:11-15

        11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into
the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had
happened. 12 When they had assembled with the elders and consulted
together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 and said,
"Tell them, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we
were asleep.' 14 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will
satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." 15 So they took the money and
did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the
Jews to this day.

106.10 The Women Tell the Disciples that Jesus had Risen:
        They Disbelieve.

MK 16:10-11

        10 She [Mary Magdalene] went and told those who had been with
him, as they mourned and wept. 11 And when they heard that he was alive
and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.

LK 24:9-11

        9 Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to
the eleven and to all the rest. 10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary
the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to
the apostles. 11 But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and
they did not believe them.

JN 20:18

        18 Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, "I have seen
the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.

Part 15 - THE RESURRECTION

107.10 The Appearance of Jesus to Peter

LK 24:12, 34
1 Corinthians 15:5a

        12 But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw
the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and then he [Jesus] appeared
to Cephas and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened.
34 [afterwards the eleven said], "The Lord has risen indeed, and has
appeared to Simon!"

108.10 Jesus Appears to Two Disciples Journeying to Emmaus

MK 16:12-13a

        12 After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they
were walking into the country. 13 And they went and told it to the
rest.

LK 24:13-35

        13 Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village
called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14 And they were
talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 15
While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with
them. 16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17 And he said
to them, "What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each
other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad. 18 Then one of
them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to
Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these
days?" 19 And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him,
"The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in
deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how the chief
priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and
crucified him. 21 But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to
redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all
this happened. 22 In addition, some women of our company amazed us.
They were at the tomb early in the morning, 23 and when they did not
find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of
angels who said he was alive. 24 Some of those who were with us went to
the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not
see." 25 And he said to them, "O foolish men, and slow of heart to
believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Did not the Christ have
to suffer these things and enter his glory?" 27 And beginning with
Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning
himself in all the scriptures.
        28 As they drew near the village to which they were going, he
acted as though he would be going farther, 29 but they constrained him,
saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far
spent." So he went in to stay with them. 30 When he was at the table
with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. 31
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished
from their sight. 32 And they said to each other, "Did not our hearts
burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to
us the scriptures?" 33 So they rose up that very hour and returned to
Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them
gathered together, 34 saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has
appeared to Simon!" 35 Then they told what had happened on the road,
and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.

108.20 The Disciples at Jerusalem still Unbelieving

MK 16:13b

        But they [the disciples] did not believe them [the two who had
been traveling to Emmaus] either.

109.10 Suddenly Jesus Appears to Them, Thomas only being Absent

MK 16:14

        14 Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and
he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.

LK 24:36-49

        36 As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and
said to them, "Peace be with you." 37 But they were startled and
frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit. 38 And he said to
them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts? 39
See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a
spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have." 40 When he had
said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they
still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, "Have you
anything here to eat?" 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and
he took it and ate in their presence.
        44 Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to
you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in
the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled." 45
Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures. 46
And he said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer
and rise again from the dead the third day, 47 and that repentance and
forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem. 48 You are witnesses of these things. 49 And
behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city,
until you are clothed with power from on high."

JN 20:19-25

        19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the
doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus
came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." 20
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the
disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them
again, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you."
22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,
"Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are
forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."
        24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with
them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, "We have seen
the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of
the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand
in his side, I will not believe."

110.10 Jesus Appears to the Disciples Thomas Being Present.

JN 20:26-30

        26 Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and
Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood
among them, and said, "Peace be with you!" 27 Then he said to Thomas,
"Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach out your hand, and put
it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but believing." 28 Thomas
answered him, "My Lord and my God!" 29 Jesus said to him, "Have you
believed because you have seen me? Blessed arethose who have not seen
and yet have believed."


        30 Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples,
which are not written in this book.

110.20 Jesus Appears to Five Hundred

1 Corinthians 15:6

        6 After that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at
one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.

111.10 Jesus Appears to the Disciples in Galilee

MT 28:16-20

        16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain
which Jesus had appointed for them. 17 When they saw him, they
worshipped him; but some doubted. 18 And Jesus came and said to them,
"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go
therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them
to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you
always, even to the end of the age."

112.10 Jesus Appears to His Disciples at the Sea of Tiberias

JN 21:1-23

        1 After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the
Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself: 2 Simon Peter,
Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of
Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter
said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with
you." They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught
nothing. 4 But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the
disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said to them,
"Children, have you any fish?" They answered him, "No." 6 He said to
them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find
some." So they cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because
of the great number of fish. 7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said
to Peter, "It is the Lord!" Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the
Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw
himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the boat,
dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, but
about a hundred yards off. 9 When they had come to land, they saw a
fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to
them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught." 11 Simon Peter
went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish, one hundred
and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
12 Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." Now none of the
disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. 13
Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same
with the fish. 14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his
disciples after he was raised from the dead.
        15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him,
"Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
16 He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love
me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to
him, "Tend my sheep." 17 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of
John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the
third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know all
things; you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded
yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will
stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where
you do not wish to go." 19 This he said to show by what death he would
glorify God. And after this he said to him, "Follow me."
        20 Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus
loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, "Lord,
who is the one who is going to betray you?" 21 When Peter saw him, he
said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?" 22 Jesus said to him, "If I
want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."
23 Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would
not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I
want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"

113.10 Jesus Appears to the Disciples in the Upper Room and Discourses
        on the Power of Faith

MK 16:14-18

        15 And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the
gospel to all creation. 16 He who believes and is baptized will be
saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. 17 And these
signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out
demons;


they will speak in new tongues; 18 they will pick up serpents; and if
they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their
hands on the sick, and they will recover."

113.20 Jesus bids them Remain at Jerusalem until the Coming of the Holy
        Ghost

Acts 1:4-5

        4 And while staying with them, he commanded them not to leave
Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, "Which," he
said, "you heard of from me; 5 for John baptized with water, but before
many days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."

113.30 The Future Witness of the Disciples to Jesus Christ

Acts 1:6-8

        6 So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you
at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?" 7 He said to
them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has
fixed by his own authority. 8 But you will receive power when the Holy
Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the
earth."

113.40 Jesus Ascends into Heaven

LK 24.50-51

        50 Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands and blessed them. 51 While he blessed them, he parted from them,
and was carried up into heaven.

Acts 1:9-11

        9 And after he had said this, as they were looking on, he was
lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. 10 And as they were
gazing intently into the sky while he was going, behold, two men in
white clothing stood beside them. 11 They also said, "Men of Galilee,
why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken
up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have
watched him go into heaven."

113.50 The Disciples Return to Jerusalem

MK 16:19

        19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken
up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.

LK 24:52

        52 Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy.

Acts 1:12-14

        12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. 13 And when they
had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying;
Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and
Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the
son of James. 14 All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer,
along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his
brothers.

113.60 The Coming of the Holy Ghost

Acts 2:1-47

        1 When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
one place. 2 And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush
of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were
sitting. 3 And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing
themselves, and they rested on each one of them. 4 And they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the
Spirit gave them utterance.
        5 Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from
every nation under heaven. 6 And at this sound the crowd came together,
and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his
own language. 7 They were amazed and wondered, saying, "Are not all
these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how is it that we hear them,
each of us in his own native language? 9 Parthians and Medes and
Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus
and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around
Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 11 Cretans
and Arabs-we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds
of God." 12 And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one
another, "What does this mean?" 13 But others were mocking and said,
"They are full of sweet wine."
        14 But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice
and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem,
let this be known to you and give heed to my words. 15 For these men
are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the
day; 16 but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
17      'And in the last days it shall be, God says,
        that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
                and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
        and your young men shall see visions,
                and your old men shall dream dreams;
18      even on my servants, both men and women,
                I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
                        and they shall prophesy.
19      And I will show wonders in heaven above
                and signs on the earth below,
                        blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
20      The sun will be turned into darkness
                and the moon into blood,
                        before the great and glorious day
                                of the Lord shall come.
21      And it shall be that everyone
                who calls on the name of the Lord
                        will be saved.'
        22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a
man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which
God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know-23 this man,
delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you
nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death. 24
But God raised him up, having loosed the agony of death, because it was
impossible for him to be held in its power. 25 For David says
concerning him,
        'I saw the Lord always before me;
                for he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.
26      Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced;
                moreover my flesh also will live in hope,
27      because you will not abandon my soul to hades,
                nor let your Holy One see decay.
28      You have made known to me the ways of life;
                you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
        29 "Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David
that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
30 And so, because he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with
an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,
31 he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,
        that he was not abandoned to hades,
                nor did his flesh see decay.
32 This Jesus God raised up again, and of that we are all witnesses. 33
Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received
from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this
which you see and hear. 34 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he
says himself:
        'The Lord said to my Lord,
        "Sit at my right hand,
35              until I make your enemies a footstool
                        for your feet."'
36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has
made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
        37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said
to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?" 38
And Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and
your children and for all who are far off, for all whom the Lord our
God will call to himself." 40 And he testified with many other words
and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse
generation." 41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there
were added that day about three thousand souls. 42 They devoted
themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the
breaking of bread and to prayer.
        43 Everyone was filled with awe; and many wonders and signs were
done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and
had all things in common; 45 and they sold their possessions and goods
and distributed them to all, as anyone had need. 46 And day by day,
attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they
ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and having
favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by
day those who were being saved.



113.70 The Disciples Praise God Continually

LK 24:53

        53 and [the disciples] were continually in the temple praising
God.

113.80 They Preach Everywhere

MK 16:20

        20 Then they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord
worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied
it. Amen.

114.10 Conclusion

Acts 1:1-3

        1 In the first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus
began to do and to teach, 2 until the day when he was taken up to
heaven, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the
apostles whom he had chosen. 3 To these he also presented himself alive
after his suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over
a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the
kingdom of God.

114.20 Epilogue

JN 21:25

        25 But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every
one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the books that would be written.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
