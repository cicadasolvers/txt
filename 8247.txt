Book 20 Proverbs
001:001 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
001:002 to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
001:003 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness,
        justice, and equity;
001:004 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion
        to the young man:
001:005 that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
        that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
001:006 to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles
        of the wise.
001:007 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish
        despise wisdom and instruction.
001:008 My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching:
001:009 for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains
        around your neck.
001:010 My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.
001:011 If they say, "Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood;
        let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
001:012 let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those
        who go down into the pit.
001:013 We'll find all valuable wealth.  We'll fill our houses with spoil.
001:014 You shall cast your lot among us.  We'll all have one purse."
001:015 My son, don't walk in the way with them.  Keep your foot
        from their path,
001:016 for their feet run to evil.  They hurry to shed blood.
001:017 For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
001:018 but these lay wait for their own blood.  They lurk secretly
        for their own lives.
001:019 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
        It takes away the life of its owners.
001:020 Wisdom calls aloud in the street.  She utters her voice
        in the public squares.
001:021 She calls at the head of noisy places.  At the entrance
        of the city gates, she utters her words:
001:022 "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
        How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
        and fools hate knowledge?
001:023 Turn at my reproof.  Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
        I will make known my words to you.
001:024 Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched
        out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
001:025 but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;
001:026 I also will laugh at your disaster.  I will mock when
        calamity overtakes you;
001:027 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes
        on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.
001:028 Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.
        They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
001:029 because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
001:030 They wanted none of my counsel.  They despised all my reproof.
001:031 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
        and be filled with their own schemes.
001:032 For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
        The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
001:033 But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease,
        without fear of harm."
002:001 My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my
        commandments within you;
002:002 So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your
        heart to understanding;
002:003 Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your
        voice for understanding;
002:004 If you seek her as silver, and search for her as
        for hidden treasures:
002:005 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find
        the knowledge of God.
002:006 For Yahweh gives wisdom.  Out of his mouth comes
        knowledge and understanding.
002:007 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.  He is a shield
        to those who walk in integrity;
002:008 that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way
        of his saints.
002:009 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and
        every good path.
002:010 For wisdom will enter into your heart.  Knowledge will be
        pleasant to your soul.
002:011 Discretion will watch over you.  Understanding will keep you,
002:012 to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who
        speak perverse things;
002:013 who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
002:014 who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;
002:015 who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
002:016 To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words;
002:017 who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant
        of her God:
002:018 for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.
002:019 None who go to her return again, neither do they attain
        to the paths of life:
002:020 that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
        of the righteous.
002:021 For the upright will dwell in the land.  The perfect will
        remain in it.
002:022 But the wicked will be cut off from the land.  The treacherous
        will be rooted out of it.
003:001 My son, don't forget my teaching; but let your heart
        keep my commandments:
003:002 for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they
        add to you.
003:003 Don't let kindness and truth forsake you.  Bind them around
        your neck.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
003:004 So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.
003:005 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don't lean on
        your own understanding.
003:006 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
        your paths straight.
003:007 Don't be wise in your own eyes.  Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
003:008 It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.
003:009 Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits
        of all your increase:
003:010 so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will
        overflow with new wine.
003:011 My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, neither be weary
        of his reproof:
003:012 for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves
        the son in whom he delights.
003:013 Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.
003:014 For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her
        return is better than fine gold.
003:015 She is more precious than rubies.  None of the things you can
        desire are to be compared to her.
003:016 Length of days is in her right hand.  In her left hand are
        riches and honor.
003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness.  All her paths are peace.
003:018 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.
        Happy is everyone who retains her.
003:019 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.  By understanding,
        he established the heavens.
003:020 By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies
        drop down the dew.
003:021 My son, let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep sound
        wisdom and discretion:
003:022 so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.
003:023 Then you shall walk in your way securely.  Your foot won't stumble.
003:024 When you lie down, you will not be afraid.  Yes, you will lie down,
        and your sleep will be sweet.
003:025 Don't be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation
        of the wicked, when it comes:
003:026 for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot
        from being taken.
003:027 Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it
        is in the power of your hand to do it.
003:028 Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again; tomorrow I
        will give it to you," when you have it by you.
003:029 Don't devise evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells
        securely by you.
003:030 Don't strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
003:031 Don't envy the man of violence.  Choose none of his ways.
003:032 For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship
        is with the upright.
003:033 Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses
        the habitation of the righteous.
003:034 Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.
003:035 The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion
        of fools.
004:001 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction.  Pay attention
        and know understanding;
004:002 for I give you sound learning.  Don't forsake my law.
004:003 For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child
        in the sight of my mother.
004:004 He taught me, and said to me:  "Let your heart retain my words.
        Keep my commandments, and live.
004:005 Get wisdom.  Get understanding.  Don't forget, neither swerve
        from the words of my mouth.
004:006 Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you.  Love her,
        and she will keep you.
004:007 Wisdom is supreme.  Get wisdom.  Yes, though it costs all
        your possessions, get understanding.
004:008 Esteem her, and she will exalt you.  She will bring you to honor,
        when you embrace her.
004:009 She will give to your head a garland of grace.  She will deliver
        a crown of splendor to you."
004:010 Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.  The years of your life
        will be many.
004:011 I have taught you in the way of wisdom.  I have led you
        in straight paths.
004:012 When you go, your steps will not be hampered.  When you run,
        you will not stumble.
004:013 Take firm hold of instruction.  Don't let her go.
        Keep her, for she is your life.
004:014 Don't enter into the path of the wicked.  Don't walk in the way
        of evil men.
004:015 Avoid it, and don't pass by it.  Turn from it, and pass on.
004:016 For they don't sleep, unless they do evil.  Their sleep is
        taken away, unless they make someone fall.
004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
004:018 But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,
        that shines more and more until the perfect day.
004:019 The way of the wicked is like darkness.  They don't know
        what they stumble over.
004:020 My son, attend to my words.  Turn your ear to my sayings.
004:021 Let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep them in the midst
        of your heart.
004:022 For they are life to those who find them, and health to
        their whole body.
004:023 Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the
        wellspring of life.
004:024 Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.  Put corrupt lips
        far from you.
004:025 Let your eyes look straight ahead.  Fix your gaze
        directly before you.
004:026 Make the path of your feet level.  Let all of your
        ways be established.
004:027 Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left.  Remove your
        foot from evil.
005:001 My son, pay attention to my wisdom.  Turn your ear
        to my understanding:
005:002 that you may maintain discretion, that your lips
        may preserve knowledge.
005:003 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.  Her mouth is
        smoother than oil,
005:004 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp
        as a two-edged sword.
005:005 Her feet go down to death.  Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
005:006 She gives no thought to the way of life.  Her ways are crooked,
        and she doesn't know it.
005:007 Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.  Don't depart from
        the words of my mouth.
005:008 Remove your way far from her.  Don't come near the door
        of her house,
005:009 lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;
005:010 lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich
        another man's house.
005:011 You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your
        body are consumed,
005:012 and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
005:013 neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned
        my ear to those who instructed me!
005:014 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of
        the gathered assembly."
005:015 Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of
        your own well.
005:016 Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water
        in the public squares?
005:017 Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.
005:018 Let your spring be blessed.  Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
005:019 A loving doe and a graceful deer--let her breasts satisfy you
        at all times.  Be captivated always with her love.
005:020 For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
        Why embrace the bosom of another?
005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.
        He examines all his paths.
005:022 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.  The cords of his sin
        hold him firmly.
005:023 He will die for lack of instruction.  In the greatness of his folly,
        he will go astray.
006:001 My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,
        if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
006:002 You are trapped by the words of your mouth.  You are ensnared
        with the words of your mouth.
006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have
        come into the hand of your neighbor.  Go, humble yourself.
        Press your plea with your neighbor.
006:004 Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
006:005 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
        like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
006:006 Go to the ant, you sluggard.  Consider her ways, and be wise;
006:007 which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
006:008 provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food
        in the harvest.
006:009 How long will you sleep, sluggard?  When will you arise out
        of your sleep?
006:010 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:
006:011 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity
        as an armed man.
006:012 A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with
        a perverse mouth;
006:013 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions
        with his fingers;
006:014 in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually,
        who always sows discord.
006:015 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.  He will be
        broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
006:016 There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are
        an abomination to him:
006:017 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;
006:018 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift
        in running to mischief,
006:019 a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows
        discord among brothers.
006:020 My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching.
006:021 Bind them continually on your heart.  Tie them around your neck.
006:022 When you walk, it will lead you.  When you sleep, it will watch
        over you.  When you awake, it will talk with you.
006:023 For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.
        Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
006:024 to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of
        the wayward wife's tongue.
006:025 Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her
        captivate you with her eyelids.
006:026 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
        The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
006:027 Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?
006:028 Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
006:029 So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.  Whoever touches
        her will not be unpunished.
006:030 Men don't despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself
        when he is hungry:
006:031 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
        He shall give all the wealth of his house.
006:032 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
        He who does it destroys his own soul.
006:033 He will get wounds and dishonor.  His reproach will not
        be wiped away.
006:034 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.  He won't spare
        in the day of vengeance.
006:035 He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content,
        though you give many gifts.
007:001 My son, keep my words.  Lay up my commandments within you.
007:002 Keep my commandments and live!  Guard my teaching as the apple
        of your eye.
007:003 Bind them on your fingers.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
007:004 Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."  Call understanding your relative,
007:005 that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words.
007:006 For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.
007:007 I saw among the simple ones.  I discerned among the youths
        a young man void of understanding,
007:008 passing through the street near her corner, he went the way
        to her house,
007:009 in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle
        of the night and in the darkness.
007:010 Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
        and with crafty intent.
007:011 She is loud and defiant.  Her feet don't stay in her house.
007:012 Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking
        at every corner.
007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him.  With an impudent face she
        said to him:
007:014 "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.  This day I have
        paid my vows.
007:015 Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face,
        and I have found you.
007:016 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped
        cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
007:018 Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning.
        Let's solace ourselves with loving.
007:019 For my husband isn't at home.  He has gone on a long journey.
007:020 He has taken a bag of money with him.  He will come home
        at the full moon."
007:021 With persuasive words, she led him astray.  With the flattering
        of her lips, she seduced him.
007:022 He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
        as a fool stepping into a noose.
007:023 Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries
        to the snare, and doesn't know that it will cost his life.
007:024 Now therefore, sons, listen to me.  Pay attention to the words
        of my mouth.
007:025 Don't let your heart turn to her ways.  Don't go astray
        in her paths,
007:026 for she has thrown down many wounded.  Yes, all her slain
        are a mighty army.
007:027 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
008:001 Doesn't wisdom cry out?  Doesn't understanding raise her voice?
008:002 On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet,
        she stands.
008:003 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors,
        she cries aloud:
008:004 "To you men, I call!  I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
008:005 You simple, understand prudence.  You fools, be of
        an understanding heart.
008:006 Hear, for I will speak excellent things.  The opening of my
        lips is for right things.
008:007 For my mouth speaks truth.  Wickedness is an abomination
        to my lips.
008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
        There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
008:009 They are all plain to him who understands, right to those
        who find knowledge.
008:010 Receive my instruction rather than silver; knowledge rather
        than choice gold.
008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies.  All the things that may be
        desired can't be compared to it.
008:012 "I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.  Find out
        knowledge and discretion.
008:013 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.  I hate pride, arrogance,
        the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
008:014 Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.  I have understanding
        and power.
008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
008:016 By me princes rule; nobles, and all the righteous rulers
        of the earth.
008:017 I love those who love me.  Those who seek me diligently
        will find me.
008:018 With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.
008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; my yield
        than choice silver.
008:020 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the
        paths of justice;
008:021 That I may give wealth to those who love me.
        I fill their treasuries.
008:022 "Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his
        deeds of old.
008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
        before the earth existed.
008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there
        were no springs abounding with water.
008:025 Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills,
        I was brought forth;
008:026 while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
        nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
008:027 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he set
        a circle on the surface of the deep,
008:028 when he established the clouds above, when the springs
        of the deep became strong,
008:029 when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not
        violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations
        of the earth;
008:030 then I was the craftsman by his side.  I was a delight day by day,
        always rejoicing before him,
008:031 Rejoicing in his whole world.  My delight was with the sons of men.
008:032 "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those
        who keep my ways.
008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise.  Don't refuse it.
008:034 Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates,
        waiting at my door posts.
008:035 For whoever finds me, finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh.
008:036 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.
        All those who hate me love death."
009:001 Wisdom has built her house.  She has carved out her seven pillars.
009:002 She has prepared her meat.  She has mixed her wine.
        She has also set her table.
009:003 She has sent out her maidens.  She cries from the highest
        places of the city:
009:004 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!"  As for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:005 "Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which
        I have mixed!
009:006 Leave your simple ways, and live.  Walk in the way of understanding."
009:007 He who corrects a mocker invites insult.  He who reproves
        a wicked man invites abuse.
009:008 Don't reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.  Reprove a wise man,
        and he will love you.
009:009 Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser.
        Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
009:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.  The knowledge
        of the Holy One is understanding.
009:011 For by me your days will be multiplied.  The years of your life
        will be increased.
009:012 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.  If you mock,
        you alone will bear it.
009:013 The foolish woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.
009:014 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places
        of the city,
009:015 To call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,
009:016 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here."  as for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:017 "Stolen water is sweet.  Food eaten in secret is pleasant."
009:018 But he doesn't know that the dead are there, that her guests
        are in the depths of Sheol.
010:001 The proverbs of Solomon.  A wise son makes a glad father;
        but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
010:003 Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,
        but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
010:004 He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand
        of the diligent brings wealth.
010:005 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps
        during the harvest is a son who causes shame.
010:006 Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence covers
        the mouth of the wicked.
010:007 The memory of the righteous is blessed, but the name of
        the wicked will rot.
010:008 The wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:009 He who walks blamelessly walks surely, but he who perverts
        his ways will be found out.
010:010 One winking with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:011 The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence
        covers the mouth of the wicked.
010:012 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all wrongs.
010:013 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,
        but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish
        is near ruin.
010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city.  The destruction
        of the poor is their poverty.
010:016 The labor of the righteous leads to life.  The increase
        of the wicked leads to sin.
010:017 He is in the way of life who heeds correction, but he who forsakes
        reproof leads others astray.
010:018 He who hides hatred has lying lips.  He who utters a slander
        is a fool.
010:019 In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,
        but he who restrains his lips does wisely.
010:020 The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.
        The heart of the wicked is of little worth.
010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many, but the foolish die
        for lack of understanding.
010:022 Yahweh's blessing brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it.
010:023 It is a fool's pleasure to do wickedness, but wisdom is a man
        of understanding's pleasure.
010:024 What the wicked fear, will overtake them, but the desire
        of the righteous will be granted.
010:025 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;
        but the righteous stand firm forever.
010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is
        the sluggard to those who send him.
010:027 The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of the wicked
        shall be shortened.
010:028 The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hope of the
        wicked will perish.
010:029 The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, but it
        is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
010:030 The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not
        dwell in the land.
010:031 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse
        tongue will be cut off.
010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth
        of the wicked is perverse.
011:001 A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate
        weights are his delight.
011:002 When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom.
011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness
        of the treacherous shall destroy them.
011:004 Riches don't profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
011:005 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,
        but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,
        but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.
011:007 When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power
        comes to nothing.
011:008 A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        takes his place.
011:009 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,
        but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.
011:010 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.
        When the wicked perish, there is shouting.
011:011 By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it
        is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
011:012 One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man
        of understanding holds his peace.
011:013 One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is
        of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.
011:014 Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in
        the multitude of counselors there is victory.
011:015 He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,
        but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.
011:016 A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches.
011:017 The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel
        troubles his own flesh.
011:018 Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness
        reaps a sure reward.
011:019 He who is truly righteous gets life.  He who pursues
        evil gets death.
011:020 Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh,
        but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.
011:021 Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,
        but the seed of the righteous will be delivered.
011:022 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman
        who lacks discretion.
011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good.  The expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.
011:024 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.
        There is one who withholds more than is appropriate,
        but gains poverty.
011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat.  He who waters shall
        be watered also himself.
011:026 People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will
        be on the head of him who sells it.
011:027 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches
        after evil, it shall come to him.
011:028 He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall
        flourish as the green leaf.
011:029 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.
        The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  He who is
        wise wins souls.
011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth; how much
        more the wicked and the sinner!
012:001 Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates
        reproof is stupid.
012:002 A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, but he will condemn
        a man of wicked devices.
012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root
        of the righteous shall not be moved.
012:004 A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but a disgraceful
        wife is as rottenness in his bones.
012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the advice
        of the wicked is deceitful.
012:006 The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,
        but the speech of the upright rescues them.
012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house
        of the righteous shall stand.
012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he who has
        a warped mind shall be despised.
012:009 Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,
        than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.
012:010 A righteous man regards the life of his animal, but the tender
        mercies of the wicked are cruel.
012:011 He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who
        chases fantasies is void of understanding.
012:012 The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, but the root
        of the righteous flourishes.
012:013 An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, but the righteous
        shall come out of trouble.
012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.
        The work of a man's hands shall be rewarded to him.
012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who is wise
        listens to counsel.
012:016 A fool shows his annoyance the same day, but one who overlooks
        an insult is prudent.
012:017 He who is truthful testifies honestly, but a false witness lies.
012:018 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,
        but the tongue of the wise heals.
012:019 Truth's lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue
        is only momentary.
012:020 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but joy comes
        to the promoters of peace.
012:021 No mischief shall happen to the righteous, but the wicked
        shall be filled with evil.
012:022 Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, but those who do
        the truth are his delight.
012:023 A prudent man keeps his knowledge, but the hearts of
        fools proclaim foolishness.
012:024 The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, but laziness ends
        in slave labor.
012:025 Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, but a kind word
        makes it glad.
012:026 A righteous person is cautious in friendship, but the way
        of the wicked leads them astray.
012:027 The slothful man doesn't roast his game, but the possessions
        of diligent men are prized.
012:028 In the way of righteousness is life; in its path there
        is no death.
013:001 A wise son listens to his father's instruction, but a scoffer
        doesn't listen to rebuke.
013:002 By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things;
        but the unfaithful crave violence.
013:003 He who guards his mouth guards his soul.  One who opens wide
        his lips comes to ruin.
013:004 The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire
        of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.
013:005 A righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings
        shame and disgrace.
013:006 Righteousness guards the way of integrity, but wickedness
        overthrows the sinner.
013:007 There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.
        There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.
013:008 The ransom of a man's life is his riches, but the poor
        hear no threats.
013:009 The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp
        of the wicked is snuffed out.
013:010 Pride only breeds quarrels, but with ones who take advice is wisdom.
013:011 Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away, but he who gathers
        by hand makes it grow.
013:012 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when longing is fulfilled,
        it is a tree of life.
013:013 Whoever despises instruction will pay for it, but he who respects
        a command will be rewarded.
013:014 The teaching of the wise is a spring of life, to turn from
        the snares of death.
013:015 Good understanding wins favor; but the way of the unfaithful is hard.
013:016 Every prudent man acts from knowledge, but a fool exposes folly.
013:017 A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy
        envoy gains healing.
013:018 Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,
        but he who heeds correction shall be honored.
013:019 Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest
        turning from evil.
013:020 One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion
        of fools suffers harm.
013:021 Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous.
013:022 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children,
        but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.
013:023 An abundance of food is in poor people's fields, but injustice
        sweeps it away.
013:024 One who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves him
        is careful to discipline him.
013:025 The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,
        but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
014:001 Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears
        it down with her own hands.
014:002 He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is
        perverse in his ways despises him.
014:003 The fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips
        of the wise protect them.
014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but much increase is
        by the strength of the ox.
014:005 A truthful witness will not lie, but a false witness
        pours out lies.
014:006 A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn't find it, but knowledge
        comes easily to a discerning person.
014:007 Stay away from a foolish man, for you won't find knowledge
        on his lips.
014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,
        but the folly of fools is deceit.
014:009 Fools mock at making atonement for sins, but among the upright
        there is good will.
014:010 The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; he will not share
        these with a stranger.
014:011 The house of the wicked will be overthrown, but the tent
        of the upright will flourish.
014:012 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
014:013 Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may
        end in heaviness.
014:014 The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; likewise a good
        man will be rewarded for his ways.
014:015 A simple man believes everything, but the prudent man carefully
        considers his ways.
014:016 A wise man fears, and shuns evil, but the fool is
        hotheaded and reckless.
014:017 He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty
        man is hated.
014:018 The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
014:019 The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates
        of the righteous.
014:020 The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,
        but the rich person has many friends.
014:021 He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who has
        pity on the poor.
014:022 Don't they go astray who plot evil?  But love and faithfulness
        belong to those who plan good.
014:023 In all hard work there is profit, but the talk of the lips
        leads only to poverty.
014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools
        crowns them with folly.
014:025 A truthful witness saves souls, but a false witness is deceitful.
014:026 In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, and he will be
        a refuge for his children.
014:027 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, turning people
        from the snares of death.
014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's glory, but in the lack
        of people is the destruction of the prince.
014:029 He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has
        a quick temper displays folly.
014:030 The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones.
014:031 He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,
        but he who is kind to the needy honors him.
014:032 The wicked is brought down in his calamity, but in death,
        the righteous has a refuge.
014:033 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,
        and is even made known in the inward part of fools.
014:034 Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.
014:035 The king's favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,
        but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
015:001 A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
015:002 The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth
        of fools gush out folly.
015:003 Yahweh's eyes are everywhere, keeping watch on the evil
        and the good.
015:004 A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but deceit in it
        crushes the spirit.
015:005 A fool despises his father's correction, but he who heeds
        reproof shows prudence.
015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income
        of the wicked brings trouble.
015:007 The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so with the
        heart of fools.
015:008 The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,
        but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but he loves
        him who follows after righteousness.
015:010 There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:
        whoever hates reproof shall die.
015:011 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh--how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men!
015:012 A scoffer doesn't love to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.
015:013 A glad heart makes a cheerful face; but an aching heart
        breaks the spirit.
015:014 The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,
        but the mouths of fools feed on folly.
015:015 All the days of the afflicted are wretched, but one who has
        a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
015:016 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, than great
        treasure with trouble.
015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened
        calf with hatred.
015:018 A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one who is slow
        to anger appeases strife.
015:019 The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path
        of the upright is a highway.
015:020 A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man
        despises his mother.
015:021 Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, but a man of
        understanding keeps his way straight.
015:022 Where there is no counsel, plans fail; but in a multitude
        of counselors they are established.
015:023 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.
        How good is a word at the right time!
015:024 The path of life leads upward for the wise, to keep him from
        going downward to Sheol.
015:025 Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, but he will keep
        the widow's borders intact.
015:026 Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the thoughts
        of the pure are pleasing.
015:027 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who
        hates bribes will live.
015:028 The heart of the righteous weighs answers, but the mouth
        of the wicked gushes out evil.
015:029 Yahweh is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer
        of the righteous.
015:030 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.  Good news gives
        health to the bones.
015:031 The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home
        among the wise.
015:032 He who refuses correction despises his own soul, but he who
        listens to reproof gets understanding.
015:033 The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.  Before honor is humility.
016:001 The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue
        is from Yahweh.
016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but Yahweh
        weighs the motives.
016:003 Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed.
016:004 Yahweh has made everything for its own end--yes, even the wicked
        for the day of evil.
016:005 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh:
        they shall certainly not be unpunished.
016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.  By the fear
        of Yahweh men depart from evil.
016:007 When a man's ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.
016:008 Better is a little with righteousness, than great
        revenues with injustice.
016:009 A man's heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps.
016:010 Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.
        He shall not betray his mouth.
016:011 Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's; all the weights
        in the bag are his work.
016:012 It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne
        is established by righteousness.
016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings.  They value one who
        speaks the truth.
016:014 The king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man
        will pacify it.
016:015 In the light of the king's face is life.  His favor is like
        a cloud of the spring rain.
016:016 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!  Yes, to get
        understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.
        He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
016:018 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
016:019 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to
        divide the plunder with the proud.
016:020 He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.  Whoever trusts
        in Yahweh is blessed.
016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent.  Pleasantness of
        the lips promotes instruction.
016:022 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,
        but the punishment of fools is their folly.
016:023 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning
        to his lips.
016:024 Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health
        to the bones.
016:025 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
016:026 The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; for his mouth
        urges him on.
016:027 A worthless man devises mischief.  His speech is like
        a scorching fire.
016:028 A perverse man stirs up strife.  A whisperer separates close friends.
016:029 A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way
        that is not good.
016:030 One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses
        his lips, is bent on evil.
016:031 Gray hair is a crown of glory.  It is attained by a
        life of righteousness.
016:032 One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
        one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
016:033 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision
        is from Yahweh.
017:001 Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full
        of feasting with strife.
017:002 A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,
        and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.
017:003 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
        but Yahweh tests the hearts.
017:004 An evil-doer heeds wicked lips.  A liar gives ear to
        a mischievous tongue.
017:005 Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.  He who is glad
        at calamity shall not be unpunished.
017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; the glory
        of children are their parents.
017:007 Arrogant speech isn't fitting for a fool, much less do lying
        lips fit a prince.
017:008 A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;
        wherever he turns, he prospers.
017:009 He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats
        a matter separates best friends.
017:010 A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than
        a hundred lashes into a fool.
017:011 An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger
        shall be sent against him.
017:012 Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.
017:013 Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart
        from his house.
017:014 The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop
        contention before quarreling breaks out.
017:015 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,
        both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.
017:016 Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
        seeing he has no understanding?
017:017 A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity.
017:018 A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral
        in the presence of his neighbor.
017:019 He who loves disobedience loves strife.  One who builds a high
        gate seeks destruction.
017:020 One who has a perverse heart doesn't find prosperity,
        and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
017:021 He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.  The father
        of a fool has no joy.
017:022 A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit
        dries up the bones.
017:023 A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert
        the ways of justice.
017:024 Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,
        but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
017:025 A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness
        to her who bore him.
017:026 Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials
        for their integrity.
017:027 He who spares his words has knowledge.  He who is even tempered
        is a man of understanding.
017:028 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.
        When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
018:001 An unfriendly man pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment.
018:002 A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing
        his own opinion.
018:003 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with
        shame comes disgrace.
018:004 The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters.
        The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
018:005 To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,
        nor to deprive the innocent of justice.
018:006 A fool's lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings.
018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare
        to his soul.
018:008 The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:  they go down
        into a person's innermost parts.
018:009 One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a
        master of destruction.
018:010 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower:  the righteous run to him,
        and are safe.
018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable
        wall in his own imagination.
018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before
        honor is humility.
018:013 He who gives answer before he hears, that is folly and
        shame to him.
018:014 A man's spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit,
        who can bear?
018:015 The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.  The ear of
        the wise seeks knowledge.
018:016 A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.
018:017 He who pleads his cause first seems right; until another comes
        and questions him.
018:018 The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart.
018:019 A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city;
        and disputes are like the bars of a castle.
018:020 A man's stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.
        With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love
        it will eat its fruit.
018:022 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains
        favor of Yahweh.
018:023 The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.
018:024 A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend
        who sticks closer than a brother.
019:001 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is
        perverse in his lips and is a fool.
019:002 It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge; nor being hasty
        with one's feet and missing the way.
019:003 The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart
        rages against Yahweh.
019:004 Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.
019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who pours out lies
        shall not go free.
019:006 Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend
        to a man who gives gifts.
019:007 All the relatives of the poor shun him:  how much more
        do his friends avoid him!  He pursues them with pleas,
        but they are gone.
019:008 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.  He who keeps understanding
        shall find good.
019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who utters
        lies shall perish.
019:010 Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less
        for a servant to have rule over princes.
019:011 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.
        It is his glory to overlook an offense.
019:012 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor
        is like dew on the grass.
019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father.  A wife's quarrels
        are a continual dripping.
019:014 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent
        wife is from Yahweh.
019:015 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.  The idle soul
        shall suffer hunger.
019:016 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is
        contemptuous in his ways shall die.
019:017 He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.
019:018 Discipline your son, for there is hope; don't be a willing
        party to his death.
019:019 A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him,
        you must do it again.
019:020 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise
        in your latter end.
019:021 There are many plans in a man's heart, but Yahweh's
        counsel will prevail.
019:022 That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
        A poor man is better than a liar.
019:023 The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests
        and will not be touched by trouble.
019:024 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much
        as bring it to his mouth again.
019:025 Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
        rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
019:026 He who robs his father and drives away his mother, is a son
        who causes shame and brings reproach.
019:027 If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray
        from the words of knowledge.
019:028 A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked
        gulps down iniquity.
019:029 Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the
        backs of fools.
020:001 Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler.  Whoever is led astray
        by them is not wise.
020:002 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.
        He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
020:003 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; but every
        fool will be quarreling.
020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;
        therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man
        of understanding will draw it out.
020:006 Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find
        a faithful man?
020:007 A righteous man walks in integrity.  Blessed are his
        children after him.
020:008 A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all
        evil with his eyes.
020:009 Who can say, "I have made my heart pure.  I am clean
        and without sin?"
020:010 Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike
        are an abomination to Yahweh.
020:011 Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his
        work is pure, and whether it is right.
020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even
        both of them.
020:013 Don't love sleep, lest you come to poverty.  Open your eyes,
        and you shall be satisfied with bread.
020:014 "It's no good, it's no good," says the buyer; but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasts.
020:015 There is gold and abundance of rubies; but the lips of knowledge
        are a rare jewel.
020:016 Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;
        and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
020:017 Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth
        is filled with gravel.
020:018 Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!
020:019 He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;
        therefore don't keep company with him who opens wide his lips.
020:020 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in blackness of darkness.
020:021 An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, won't be blessed
        in the end.
020:022 Don't say, "I will pay back evil."  Wait for Yahweh,
        and he will save you.
020:023 Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales
        are not pleasing.
020:024 A man's steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way?
020:025 It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later
        to consider his vows.
020:026 A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing
        wheel over them.
020:027 The spirit of man is Yahweh's lamp, searching all
        his innermost parts.
020:028 Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.  His throne is
        sustained by love.
020:029 The glory of young men is their strength.  The splendor of old
        men is their gray hair.
020:030 Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge
        the innermost parts.
021:001 The king's heart is in Yahweh's hand like the watercourses.
        He turns it wherever he desires.
021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh
        weighs the hearts.
021:003 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to
        Yahweh than sacrifice.
021:004 A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
021:005 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone
        who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.
021:006 Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor
        for those who seek death.
021:007 The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they
        refuse to do what is right.
021:008 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the
        innocent is upright.
021:009 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
021:010 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy
        in his eyes.
021:011 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.
        When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
021:012 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings
        the wicked to ruin.
021:013 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out,
        but shall not be heard.
021:014 A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak,
        strong wrath.
021:015 It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction
        to the workers of iniquity.
021:016 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest
        in the assembly of the dead.
021:017 He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man.  He who loves wine
        and oil shall not be rich.
021:018 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; the treacherous
        for the upright.
021:019 It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious
        and fretful woman.
021:020 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
        but a foolish man swallows it up.
021:021 He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life,
        righteousness, and honor.
021:022 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down
        the strength of its confidence.
021:023 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
021:024 The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name; he works
        in the arrogance of pride.
021:025 The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.
021:026 There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous
        give and don't withhold.
021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:  how much more,
        when he brings it with a wicked mind!
021:028 A false witness will perish, and a man who listens
        speaks to eternity.
021:029 A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright,
        he establishes his ways.
021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh.
021:031 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory
        is with Yahweh.
022:001 A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving
        favor is better than silver and gold.
022:002 The rich and the poor have this in common:  Yahweh is the maker
        of them all.
022:003 A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
022:004 The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth,
        honor, and life.
022:005 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:
        whoever guards his soul stays from them.
022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old
        he will not depart from it.
022:007 The rich rule over the poor.  The borrower is servant
        to the lender.
022:008 He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury
        will be destroyed.
022:009 He who has a generous eye will be blessed; for he shares his
        food with the poor.
022:010 Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and
        insults will stop.
022:011 He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is
        the king's friend.
022:012 The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; but he frustrates
        the words of the unfaithful.
022:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!  I will be killed
        in the streets!"
022:014 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit:  he who is under
        Yahweh's wrath will fall into it.
022:015 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:  the rod of discipline
        drives it far from him.
022:016 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever
        gives to the rich, both come to poverty.
022:017 Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.
        Apply your heart to my teaching.
022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,
        if all of them are ready on your lips.
022:019 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you.
022:020 Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things of
        counsel and knowledge,
022:021 To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers
        to the ones who sent you?
022:022 Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; and don't crush
        the needy in court;
022:023 for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life
        of those who plunder them.
022:024 Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, and don't associate with one
        who harbors anger:
022:025 lest you learn his ways, and ensnare your soul.
022:026 Don't you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are
        collateral for debts.
022:027 If you don't have means to pay, why should he take away your
        bed from under you?
022:028 Don't move the ancient boundary stone, which your fathers
        have set up.
022:029 Do you see a man skilled in his work?  He will serve kings.
        He won't serve obscure men.
023:001 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what
        is before you;
023:002 put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite.
023:003 Don't be desirous of his dainties, seeing they are deceitful food.
023:004 Don't weary yourself to be rich.  In your wisdom, show restraint.
023:005 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?  For it certainly
        sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
023:006 Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don't
        crave his delicacies:
023:007 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.  "Eat and drink!"
        he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
023:008 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose
        your good words.
023:009 Don't speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom
        of your words.
023:010 Don't move the ancient boundary stone.  Don't encroach on
        the fields of the fatherless:
023:011 for their Defender is strong.  He will plead their case against you.
023:012 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the
        words of knowledge.
023:013 Don't withhold correction from a child.  If you punish him
        with the rod, he will not die.
023:014 Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol.
023:015 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine:
023:016 yes, my heart will rejoice, when your lips speak what is right.
023:017 Don't let your heart envy sinners; but rather fear Yahweh
        all the day long.
023:018 Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not
        be cut off.
023:019 Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!
023:020 Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge
        themselves on meat:
023:021 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;
        and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
023:022 Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise
        your mother when she is old.
023:023 Buy the truth, and don't sell it.  Get wisdom, discipline,
        and understanding.
023:024 The father of the righteous has great joy.  Whoever fathers
        a wise child delights in him.
023:025 Let your father and your mother be glad!  Let her who
        bore you rejoice!
023:026 My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways.
023:027 For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is
        a narrow well.
023:028 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the
        unfaithful among men.
023:029 Who has woe?  Who has sorrow?  Who has strife?  Who has complaints?
        Who has needless bruises?  Who has bloodshot eyes?
023:030 Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek
        out mixed wine.
023:031 Don't look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup,
        when it goes down smoothly.
023:032 In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper.
023:033 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will
        imagine confusing things.
023:034 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,
        or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
023:035 "They hit me, and I was not hurt!  They beat me, and I
        don't feel it!  When will I wake up?  I can do it again.
        I can find another."
024:001 Don't be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them:
024:002 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief.
024:003 Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established;
024:004 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare
        and beautiful treasure.
024:005 A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable
        man increases strength;
024:006 for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is
        in many advisors.
024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool:  he doesn't open his mouth
        in the gate.
024:008 One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer.
024:009 The schemes of folly are sin.  The mocker is detested by men.
024:010 If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small.
024:011 Rescue those who are being led away to death!  Indeed, hold back
        those who are staggering to the slaughter!
024:012 If you say, "Behold, we didn't know this;" doesn't he who weighs
        the hearts consider it?  He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it?
        Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
024:013 My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb,
        which are sweet to your taste:
024:014 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it,
        then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off.
024:015 Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of
        the righteous.  Don't destroy his resting place:
024:016 for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;
        but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
024:017 Don't rejoice when your enemy falls.  Don't let your heart
        be glad when he is overthrown;
024:018 lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.
024:019 Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious
        of the wicked:
024:020 for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp
        of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
024:021 My son, fear Yahweh and the king.  Don't join those
        who are rebellious:
024:022 for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from
        them both--who knows?
024:023 These also are sayings of the wise.  To show partiality
        in judgment is not good.
024:024 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;" peoples shall
        curse him, and nations shall abhor him--
024:025 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
        and a rich blessing will come on them.
024:026 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
024:027 Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready.
        Afterwards, build your house.
024:028 Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause.
        Don't deceive with your lips.
024:029 Don't say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render
        to the man according to his work."
024:030 I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man
        void of understanding;
024:031 Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.  Its surface was
        covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
024:032 Then I saw, and considered well.  I saw, and received instruction:
024:033 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep;
024:034 so shall your poverty come as a robber, and your want as
        an armed man.
025:001 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.
025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the glory
        of kings is to search out a matter.
025:003 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the hearts
        of kings are unsearchable.
025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and material comes out
        for the refiner;
025:005 Take away the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne
        will be established in righteousness.
025:006 Don't exalt yourself in the presence of the king, or claim
        a place among great men;
025:007 for it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here,"
        than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
        whom your eyes have seen.
025:008 Don't be hasty in bringing charges to court.  What will you
        do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
025:009 Debate your case with your neighbor, and don't betray
        the confidence of another;
025:010 lest one who hears it put you to shame, and your bad
        reputation never depart.
025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
        so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the soul
        of his masters.
025:014 As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts
        of gifts deceptively.
025:015 By patience a ruler is persuaded.  A soft tongue breaks the bone.
025:016 Have you found honey?  Eat as much as is sufficient for you,
        lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
025:017 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he be
        weary of you, and hate you.
025:018 A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club,
        a sword, or a sharp arrow.
025:019 Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble is like
        a bad tooth, or a lame foot.
025:020 As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, or vinegar
        on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
025:021 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.  If he is thirsty,
        give him water to drink:
025:022 for you will heap coals of fire on his head, and Yahweh
        will reward you.
025:023 The north wind brings forth rain:  so a backbiting tongue
        brings an angry face.
025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
025:025 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from
        a far country.
025:026 Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, so is a righteous
        man who gives way before the wicked.
025:027 It is not good to eat much honey; nor is it honorable to seek
        one's own honor.
025:028 Like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man
        whose spirit is without restraint.
026:001 Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not
        fitting for a fool.
026:002 Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow,
        so the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest.
026:003 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod
        for the back of fools!
026:004 Don't answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also
        be like him.
026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in
        his own eyes.
026:006 One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off
        feet and drinking violence.
026:007 Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:  so is a parable
        in the mouth of fools.
026:008 As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor
        to a fool.
026:009 Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
        so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
026:010 As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool
        or he who hires those who pass by.
026:011 As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a fool who
        repeats his folly.
026:012 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
026:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!
        A fierce lion roams the streets!"
026:014 As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.
026:015 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.  He is too lazy
        to bring it back to his mouth.
026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who
        answer with discretion.
026:017 Like one who grabs a dog's ears is one who passes by and meddles
        in a quarrel not his own.
026:018 Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
026:019 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not joking?"
026:020 For lack of wood a fire goes out.  Without gossip,
        a quarrel dies down.
026:021 As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious
        man to kindling strife.
026:022 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down
        into the innermost parts.
026:023 Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent
        one with an evil heart.
026:024 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors
        evil in his heart.
026:025 When his speech is charming, don't believe him; for there
        are seven abominations in his heart.
026:026 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness
        will be exposed in the assembly.
026:027 Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.  Whoever rolls a stone,
        it will come back on him.
026:028 A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering
        mouth works ruin.
027:001 Don't boast about tomorrow; for you don't know what a day
        may bring forth.
027:002 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger,
        and not your own lips.
027:003 A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool's provocation
        is heavier than both.
027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able
        to stand before jealousy?
027:005 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; although the kisses
        of an enemy are profuse.
027:007 A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul,
        every bitter thing is sweet.
027:008 As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders
        from his home.
027:009 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest
        counsel from a man's friend.
027:010 Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend.
        Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster:
        better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
027:011 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can
        answer my tormentor.
027:012 A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
027:013 Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.
        Hold it for a wayward woman!
027:014 He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
        it will be taken as a curse by him.
027:015 A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious
        wife are alike:
027:016 restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping
        oil in his right hand.
027:017 Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
027:018 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.
        He who looks after his master shall be honored.
027:019 As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man.
027:020 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man's eyes
        are never satisfied.
027:021 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
        but man is refined by his praise.
027:022 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
        yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
027:023 Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention
        to your herds:
027:024 for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure
        to all generations.
027:025 The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses
        of the hills are gathered in.
027:026 The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price
        of a field.
027:027 There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, for your
        family's food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
028:001 The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are
        as bold as a lion.
028:002 In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained
        by a man of understanding and knowledge.
028:003 A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain
        which leaves no crops.
028:004 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep
        the law contend with them.
028:005 Evil men don't understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh
        understand it fully.
028:006 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is
        perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
028:007 Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion
        of gluttons shames his father.
028:008 He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it
        for one who has pity on the poor.
028:009 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
        is an abomination.
028:010 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will
        fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.
028:011 The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has
        understanding sees through him.
028:012 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when
        the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
028:013 He who conceals his sins doesn't prosper, but whoever confesses
        and renounces them finds mercy.
028:014 Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his
        heart falls into trouble.
028:015 As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler
        over helpless people.
028:016 A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.  One who hates ill-gotten
        gain will have long days.
028:017 A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death;
        no one will support him.
028:018 Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse
        ways will fall suddenly.
028:019 One who works his land will have an abundance of food;
        but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
028:020 A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager
        to be rich will not go unpunished.
028:021 To show partiality is not good; yet a man will do wrong
        for a piece of bread.
028:022 A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn't know that poverty
        waits for him.
028:023 One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one
        who flatters with the tongue.
028:024 Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, "It's not wrong."
        He is a partner with a destroyer.
028:025 One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in
        Yahweh will prosper.
028:026 One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom
        is kept safe.
028:027 One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes
        his eyes will have many curses.
028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish,
        the righteous thrive.
029:001 He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be
        destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.
029:002 When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; but when
        the wicked rule, the people groan.
029:003 Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion
        of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
029:004 The king by justice makes the land stable, but he who takes
        bribes tears it down.
029:005 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
029:006 An evil man is snared by his sin, but the righteous can sing
        and be glad.
029:007 The righteous care about justice for the poor.  The wicked
        aren't concerned about knowledge.
029:008 Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.
029:009 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages
        or scoffs, and there is no peace.
029:010 The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life
        of the upright.
029:011 A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings
        himself under control.
029:012 If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked.
029:013 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
        Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.
029:014 The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall
        be established forever.
029:015 The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself
        causes shame to his mother.
029:016 When the wicked increase, sin increases; but the righteous
        will see their downfall.
029:017 Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring
        delight to your soul.
029:018 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
        but one who keeps the law is blessed.
029:019 A servant can't be corrected by words.  Though he understands,
        yet he will not respond.
029:020 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
029:021 He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become
        a son in the end.
029:022 An angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin.
029:023 A man's pride brings him low, but one of lowly spirit gains honor.
029:024 Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.
        He takes an oath, but dares not testify.
029:025 The fear of man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust
        in Yahweh is kept safe.
029:026 Many seek the ruler's favor, but a man's justice comes from Yahweh.
029:027 A dishonest man detests the righteous, and the upright in their
        ways detest the wicked.
030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle:
        the man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
030:002 "Surely I am the most ignorant man, and don't have
        a man's understanding.
030:003 I have not learned wisdom, neither do I have the knowledge
        of the Holy One.
030:004 Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?  Who has
        gathered the wind in his fists?  Who has bound the waters
        in his garment?  Who has established all the ends of the earth?
        What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?
030:005 "Every word of God is flawless.  He is a shield to those who take
        refuge in him.
030:006 Don't you add to his words, lest he reprove you, and you
        be found a liar.
030:007 "Two things I have asked of you; don't deny me before I die:
030:008 Remove far from me falsehood and lies.  Give me neither poverty
        nor riches.  Feed me with the food that is needful for me;
030:009 lest I be full, deny you, and say, 'Who is Yahweh?' or lest
        I be poor, and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
030:010 "Don't slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you,
        and you be held guilty.
030:011 There is a generation that curses their father, and doesn't
        bless their mother.
030:012 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,
        yet are not washed from their filthiness.
030:013 There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
        Their eyelids are lifted up.
030:014 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their
        jaws like knives, to devour the poor from the earth,
        and the needy from among men.
030:015 "The leach has two daughters:  'Give, give.'  "There are three
        things that are never satisfied; four that don't say, 'Enough:'
030:016 Sheol, the barren womb; the earth that is not satisfied with water;
        and the fire that doesn't say, 'Enough.'
030:017 "The eye that mocks at his father, and scorns obedience
        to his mother:  the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
        the young eagles shall eat it.
030:018 "There are three things which are too amazing for me,
        four which I don't understand:
030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock;
        the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man
        with a maiden.
030:020 "So is the way of an adulterous woman:  she eats and wipes
        her mouth, and says, 'I have done nothing wrong.'
030:021 "For three things the earth tremble, and under four,
        it can't bear up:
030:022 For a servant when he is king; a fool when he is filled with food;
030:023 for an unloved woman when she is married; and a handmaid
        who is heir to her mistress.
030:024 "There are four things which are little on the earth,
        but they are exceedingly wise:
030:025 the ants are not a strong people, yet they provide their food
        in the summer.
030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks.
030:027 The locusts have no king, yet they advance in ranks.
030:028 You can catch a lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.
030:029 "There are three things which are stately in their march,
        four which are stately in going:
030:030 The lion, which is mightiest among animals, and doesn't turn
        away for any;
030:031 the greyhound, the male goat also; and the king against whom
        there is no rising up.
030:032 "If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you
        have thought evil, put your hand over your mouth.
030:033 For as the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing
        of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath
        brings forth strife."
031:001 The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
031:002 "Oh, my son!  Oh, son of my womb!  Oh, son of my vows!
031:003 Don't give your strength to women, nor your ways to that
        which destroys kings.
031:004 It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine;
        nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?'
031:005 lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice
        due to anyone who is afflicted.
031:006 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine
        to the bitter in soul:
031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his
        misery no more.
031:008 Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who
        are left desolate.
031:009 Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to
        the poor and needy."
031:010 {Proverbs 31:10-31 form an acrostic, with each verse starting
        with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order.}Who can
        find a worthy woman?  For her price is far above rubies.
031:011 The heart of her husband trusts in her.  He shall have no
        lack of gain.
031:012 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.
031:013 She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.
031:014 She is like the merchant ships.  She brings her bread from afar.
031:015 She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household,
        and portions for her servant girls.
031:016 She considers a field, and buys it.  With the fruit of her hands,
        she plants a vineyard.
031:017 She girds her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.
031:018 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
        Her lamp doesn't go out by night.
031:019 She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
031:020 She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands
        to the needy.
031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.
031:022 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.  Her clothing
        is fine linen and purple.
031:023 Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among
        the elders of the land.
031:024 She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes
        to the merchant.
031:025 Strength and dignity are her clothing.  She laughs at
        the time to come.
031:026 She opens her mouth with wisdom.  Faithful instruction is
        on her tongue.
031:027 She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn't eat
        the bread of idleness.
031:028 Her children rise up and call her blessed.  Her husband
        also praises her:
031:029 "Many women do noble things, but you excel them all."
031:030 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh,
        she shall be praised.
031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands!  Let her works praise
        her in the gates!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
