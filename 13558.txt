ENGLISH AND AMERICAN REPRINTS OF OLD BOOKS

Most people are aware of the great demand there is for English
literature, and indeed for all literature in the United States: for some
years the anxiety of persons in that part of the world to obtain copies
of our early printed books, prose, poetry, and plays, has been well
known to such as collect and sell them on this side of the water. Where
American purchasers could not obtain original editions they have, in all
possible cases, secured reprints, and they have made some themselves.

Not very long since a present of a most creditable and well-edited
republication of "Four Old Plays" was sent to me from Cambridge, U.S.,
consisting of "Three Interludes: _Thersytes_, _Jack Jugler_, and
Heywood's _Pardoner and Frere_; and _Jocasta_, a tragedy by Gascoigne
and Kinwelmarsh." They are preceded by a very well written and
intelligent, and at the same time modest, Introduction, signed F.J.C.,
the initials of Mr. Francis James Child; who in fact was kind enough to
forward the volume to me, and who, if I am not mistaken, was formerly a
correspondent of mine in a different part of the republic.

My particular reason for noticing the book is to impress upon editors in
this country the necessity of accuracy, not only for the sake of readers
and critics here, but for the sake of those abroad, because Mr. Child's
work illustrates especially the disadvantage of the want of that
accuracy. It so happens that two, if not three, of the pieces included
in the Cambridge volume, are absolutely unique, and are now in the
library of the Duke of Devonshire. They went through my hands some years
ago, and as they had been previously reprinted in London (two of them
for the Roxburghe Club), I took the opportunity of collating my copies
of them. The third interlude, which was not reprinted for any society,
but as a private speculation, "by George Smeeton, in St. Martin's
Church-yard," is Heywood's _Pardoner and Frere_, the full title of which
is "_A mery playe betwene the pardoner, and the frere, the curate and
neybour Pratte_." The original copy has the following imprint:
"Imprynted by Wyllyam Rastell the v. day of Apryll, the yere of our
lorde, M. CCCCC. xxx III."

The reprint by Smeeton is in black letter, and it professes to be a
fac-simile, or as nearly so as possible; and although it consists of
only eight leaves, it contains no fewer than forty variations from the
original, all more or less important, and one of them the total omission
of a line, so that the preceding line is left without its corresponding
rhyme, and the sense materially injured.

Unfortunately, Mr. Child reprinted in America from this defective
reprint in England; but his sagacity prevented him from falling into
some of the blunders, although it could not supply him with the wanting
line; and his notes are extremely clear and pertinent. I shall not go
over the thirty-nine other errors; but I shall just quote the passage as
it stands in the (as far as I know) unique copy, now deposited at
Devonshire House, and supply in italics the necessary line. It occurs in
a speech by the Pardoner, near the end, where he is praising one of his
relics:-- {210}

  "I wyll edefy more, with the syght of it
  Than wyll all the pratynge of holy wryt;
  For that except that the precher, hym selfe lyue well,
  His predycacyon wyll helpe neuer a dell,
  And I know well, that thy lyuynge is nought:
  _Thou art an apostata, yf it were well sought_,
  An homycyde thou art I know well inoughe," &c.

The line omitted is the more remarkable, because it contains an instance
of the employment of a word very old in our language, and in use in the
best periods of our prose and poetry: "apostata" is explained in the
_Promptorium_, is found in Skelton and Heywood, and so down to the time
of Massinger, who was especially fond of it.

How many copies were issued of Smeeton's reprint of _The Pardoner and
the Frere_, I know not; but any of your readers, who chance to possess
it, will do well to add the absent line in the margin, so that the
mistake may be both rectified and recorded. I was not aware of Mr.
Child's intention to re-publish the interlude in the United States, or I
would long ago have sent him the correction, as indeed I did, a day or
two after I received his volume. It was, nevertheless, somewhat
ungracious to thank him for his book, and at the same time to point out
an important error in it, for which, however, he was in no way
responsible.

CATACOMBS AND BONE-HOUSES.

Without attempting to answer the queries of MR. GATTY, (No. 11. p. 171.)
I venture to send a note on the subject. I believe it will generally be
found that the local tradition makes such collections of bones to be
"the grisly gleanings of some battlefield." One of the most noteworthy
collections of this kind that I have seen is contained in the crypt of
Hythe Church, Kent, where a vast quantity of bones are piled up with
great regularity, and preserved with much care. According to a written
statement suspended in the crypt, they are the relics of Britons and
Saxons slain in a battle fought on the beach in the sixth century; the
local tradition is nearly to the same effect, but of course is of little
value, as it has most likely arisen from or been conformed to this
"written chronicle;" both writing and tradition must indeed be regarded
with distrust. It is affirmed in the neighbourhood that the bones were
_dug up_ from the beach; but I, at least, could hear of no tradition as
to the period when they were exhumed. Perhaps some resident will
ascertain whether any such exists.

The bones have all the appearance of considerable antiquity; yet they
are in excellent preservation. The skulls are remarkably white and
perfect, and are altogether a very curious collection, differing greatly
in size, form, and thickness. The holes and fractures in many of them
(made evidently during life) leave no doubt that they belonged to
persons who met with a violent death.

I will not pretend to reply to the concluding queries of your
correspondent, but I would just remark that, from what we know of the
feeling of our ancestors respecting the remains of the dead, it appears
probably that if from any cause a large quantity of human bones were
found, or were from any cause obliged to be disturbed, some ecclesiastic
or pious layman would take measures to have them removed to some
consecrated spot where they might be safe from further molestation. They
would hardly be treated in any such manner as Dr. Mantell states the
bones removed by the railway engineers from the Priory ground at Lewes
were treated. I remain, sir, your very obedient servant,

J.T.

LINES ATTRIBUTED TO HUDIBRAS.

Perhaps the following extract from a volume entitled _The Relics of
Literature_, published by Boys and Co., Ludgate Hill, 1820, may prove
interesting, as further illustrating the so frequently disputed passage
which forms the subject matter of your first article in No. 12.:--

    "Few popular quotations have more engaged the pens of critics
    than the following:--

      'For he that fights and runs away
      Will live to fight another day.'

    "These lines are almost universally supposed to form a part of
    _Hudibras_; and, so confident have even scholars been on the
    subject, that in 1784 a wager was made at Bootle's, of twenty to
    one, that they were to be found in that inimitable poem. Dodsley
    was referred to as the arbitrator, when he ridiculed the idea of
    consulting him on the subject, saying, 'Every fool knows they
    are in _Hudibras_.' George Selwyn, who was present, said to
    Dodsley, 'Pray, sir, will you be good enough, then, to inform an
    old fool, who is at the same time your wise worship's very
    humble servant, in what canto they are to be found?' Dodsley
    took down the volume, but he could not find the passage; the
    next day came, with no better success; and the sage bibliopole
    was obliged to confess, 'that a man might be ignorant of the
    author of this well-known couplet without being absolutely a
    fool.'"

I have also the following memorandum in a common-place book of mine, but
I do not remember from what source I transcribed it many years past:--

    "The couplet, thus erroneously ascribed to the author of
    _Hudibras_, occurs in a small volume of Miscellaneous Poems, by
    Sir John Mennis, written in the reign of Charles the Second,
    which has now become extremely scarce. The original of the
    couplet may, however, be traced to much higher authority, even
    to Demosthenes, who has the following expression:-- {211}

      '[Greek: Anaer ho pheugon kai palin machaesetai]',

    of which the lines are almost a literal translation."

While on the subject of quotations, let me ask whether any of your
correspondents can tell me where the passage, "Providence tempers the
wind to the shorn lamb," is to be found?

Among a few of the many floating quotable passages universally known,
without any trace of the authors, among general readers and writers, are
the following:--

  "When wild in woods the noble savage ran."

DRYDEN's _Conquest of Grenada_.

  "And whistled as he went for want of thought."

DRYDEN's _Cymon and Iphigenia_.

  "Great wits are sure to madness near allied,
  And thin partitions do their bounds divide."

DRYDEN's _Absalom and Achitophel_, st. i. I. 163.

  "The tenth transmitter of a foolish face."

SAVAGE.

  "When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war."

NAT. LEE.

The real line in Lee is--

  "When Greeks join Greeks then was the tug of war."

LEE's _Alexander the Great_.

J.W.G. GUTCH

       *       *       *       *       *

I wish to ask a few questions, referring to these lines, if you do not
think the subject already exhausted by Mr. Rimbault's curious and
interesting communication.

1. Does not the _entire_ quotation run somewhat thus:--

  "For he that fights and runs away
  May live to fight another day;
  But he that is in battle slain
  Can never hope to fight again"?

2. Are the two last lines in the _Musarum Deliciae_?

3. May not the idea suggesting the two first lines be traced to some
passage in one of the orations of _Demosthenes_, and, PAST him, to the
"[Greek: Anaer ho pheugon kai palin machaesetai]" of some contemporary,
if not still older writer?

4. Whose _Apothegems_ [qy., those of Demosthenes?] are under
consideration on folio 239., from which Mr. Rimbault quotes?

Queries 1, 2, 3 have long stood _in MS._ in my note-book, and I should
much like to see them in _print_, while the subject to which they refer
is still fresh in the minds of your readers.

The lines--

  "For he that fights and runs away
  May live to fight another day,"

resemble the following quatrain in the _Satyre Menippee_, being one of
the several verses appended to the tapestry on which was wrought the
battle of Senlis:--

  "Souvent celuy qui demeure
  Est cause de son meschef;
  Celuy qui fuit de bonne heure
  Peut combattre de rechef."

NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES, No. 5.

In the library of St. John's College are some hundreds of volumes
bequeathed to it by Thomas Baker; most of these have little notices on
the fly-leaves, some thirty or forty of which seem worth printing. One
(Strype's _Life of Parker_) has marginal notes throughout the book, the
value of which will be duly appreciated by those who have read Baker's
notes on Burnet's _Reformation_. (See the _British Magazine_ for the
last year.)

Hereafter, if you do not object, I hope to send larger extracts from
Baker's MSS.; at present I confine myself to a single specimen, taken
from the fly-leaf of a copy of Noy's _Compleat Lawyer_, London, 1665.

It may be as well to add, that the references to vols. xxx. and xxxvi.
of MS. are to two different copies of the will in two volumes of Baker's
MSS., in the University library. The word "dissipanding," in the last
quotation, doubtless is an allusion {212} to "dissipanda" in the will
itself. I once had occasion to take a copy of this will, and found the
variations between the two copies trifling.

THE PURSUITS OF LITERATURE.

Many years ago, the satirical poem, entitled _The Pursuits of
Literature_, engaged public attention for a very considerable time; the
author concealed his name; and from 1796 at least to 1800, the world
continued guessing at who could be the author. Amongst the names to
which the poem was ascribed were those of Anstey, Colman, Jun., Coombe,
Cumberland, Harry Dampier, Goodall, Hudderford, Knapp, MATHIAS, Mansell,
Wrangham, Stephen Weston, and many others, chiefly Etonians. George
Steevens, it is believed, fixed upon the real author at an early period:
at least in the _St. James's Chronicle_, from Tuesday, May 1. to
Thursday, May 3. 1798, we find--

QUERIES.

BARRYANA.

The inquiries of "DRAMATICUS," and others in your number for Nov. 10.,
prompt me to say that should any of your correspondents happen to
possess information answering the following queries, or any of them, I
shall be thankful to share it.

1. What became of the natural child of Elizabeth Barry, the actress, who
died 1713; and whether the Earl of Rochester, its father, was really
Wilmot (as Galt assumes) or Hyde, on whom that title was conferred at
Wilmot's death? The former mentions a natural daughter in his last will;
but he names it "Elizabeth Clerke," and does not allude to its mother.
Mrs. Barry's will mentions no kindred whatever. But Galt describes her
as daughter of Edward Barry, Esq., a barrister of Charles I.'s
reign.--Who was he? Spranger Barry, the actor of fifty years later, Sir
William Betham and myself have succeeded in connecting satisfactorily,
and legitimately, with the noble house of Barry, Lord Santry; but I
cannot as yet show that Mrs. E. Barry inherited her theatrical talent
from an identical source.

2. Of what family was Mr. Barry, the Secretary to the Equivalent
Company, who died about 1738? I possess immense collections on the name
of Barry, but I cannot identify any London will or administration as
this individual's.

3. Whether Sir Robert Walpole's Secret Government Lists of the
Pretender's adherents, agents, and emissaries in London (who were
supposed to be under the evil-eye of Jonathan Wild) still exist, and are
accessible?

NINE QUERIES.

1. _Book-plate._--Whose was the book-plate with the following
device:--An eagle or vulture feeding with a snake another bird nearly as
large as herself; a landscape, with the sea, &c. in the distance: very
meanly engraved, in an oval, compassed with the motto, "Pietas homini
tutissima virtus"?

2. _Addison's Books._--I have two or three volumes, bound apparently at
the beginning of {213} the last century, with a stamp on the cover,
consisting of J.A., in a cursive character, within a small circle. Was
this the book-stamp of Joseph Addison?

3. _Viridis Vallis._--Where was the monastery of "Viridis Vallis," and
what is its vernacular name?

4. _Cosmopoli._--Has _Cosmopoli_ been ever appropriated to any known
locality? Archdeacon Cotton mentions it among the pseudonymes in his
_Typographical Gazetteer_. The work whose real locality I wish to
ascertain is, _Sandii Paradox_. iv. _Evang._ 1670. 1 vol. 8vo.

5. _Seriopoli._--The same information is wanting respecting "Seriopoli;
apud Entrapelios Impensis Catonis Uticensis:" which occurs in the
title-page of "Seria de Jocis," one of the tracts connected with the
Bollandist controversy.

6. _Early Edition of the Vulgate._--Where is there any critical notice
of a very beautiful edition of the Vultage, small 4to., entitled "Sacra
Biblia, cum studiis ac diligentia emendata;" in the colophon, "Venetiis,
apud Jolitos, 1588"? The preface is by "Johannes Jolitus de Ferrarues."
The book is full of curious wood-cuts. This is not the book mentioned in
Masch's _Le Long_ (part ii, p. 229), though that was also printed by the
Gioliti in 1588; as the title of the latter book is "Biblia ad
vetustissima Exemplaria castigata," and the preface is by Hentenius.

7. _Identity of Anonymous Annotators._--Can any of the correspondents of
"NOTES AND QUERIES" point out to a literary Backwoodsman, like myself,
any royal road towards assigning to the proper authors the handwriting
of anonymous annotations in fly-leaves and margins? I have many of
these, which I should be glad to ascertain.

8. _Complutensian Polyglot._--In what review or periodical did there
appear, some time ago, a notice of the supposed discovery (or of
conjectures as to the existence) of the MSS. from which the
"Complutensian Polyglot" was compiled, involving, of course, the
repudiation of the common story of the rocket maker of Alcala? Has any
further light been thrown on this subject?

9. _Blunder in Malone's Shakspeare._--Has any notice been taken of the
following odd blunder in Malone's _Shakspeare_, Dublin ed. 1794?

In vol. ii. p. 138, the editor, speaking of _John_ Shakspeare's will
(the father of William), says "This extraordinary will consisted of
fourteen articles, _but the first leaf being unluckily wanting_, I am
unable to ascertain either its date, or the particular occasion on which
it was written." He then gives a copy of the will, beginning at the
third article, in the middle of a sentence, thus: "... at least
spiritually." Now, in the first vol. p. 154. is a document, professing
to be William Shakspeare's will. But of this the first three paragraphs
belong to John Shakspeare's will, his name being mentioned in each: and
the third concludes with the words "at least spiritually." The fourth
paragraph, to the end, belongs to William Shakspeare's will, as given in
Johnson and Stevens's editions. This is a palpable instance of editorial
carelessness: Mr. Malone had mixed the two documents, mislaid the first
portion of the transcript of William Shakspeare's will, and then
neglected to examine the postscript, or he must have found out his
mistake.

MINOR QUERIES

_Mowbray Coheirs._--Collins in his _Peerage_ (ed. Brydges, 1812), says,
at p. 18., speaking of Thomas Duke of Norfolk:--

    "In 15 Henry VII, he made partition with Maurice, surviving
    brother of William Marquiss of Berkeley (who died issueless), of
    the lands that came to them by inheritance, by right of their
    descent, from the coheirs of _Mowbray_, Duke of Norfolk;"

and quotes, as his authority, _Commun. de T. Pasch, 15 Henry VII., Rot._
1.

The roll of the whole year referred to has been examined, without
finding any notice of the subject.

Should any of your readers have met with the statement elsewhere, it may
happen that there is some error in Collins's reference to his authority;
and a clue to the right roll, or any other notice of the division of
this great inheritance, will be acceptable.

_Draytone and Yong._--The following note was found by me among the
Exchequer Records, on their sale and dispersion, a few years ago:--

    "I praye you fellowe Draytone do so invehe for me as to Resave
    all svche moneye as is dewe to me from the handes of Ser
    Vincente Skyner Knyghte or else wheare from thos offysers of the
    excheqer And this shalbe yovr discharge. Written the laste daye
    of Janvarye 1607. Henry Yong."

Can your subscribers inform me who the writer was? Mr. Payne Collier
states that there was an interlude-maker of the name of Henry Yong in
the reign of Henry VIII. Is it likely that the note was addressed to
Michael Drayton?

_The Fraternity of Christian Doctrine._--I think I see some names among
your correspondents who might inform me where I shall find the fullest
account of the Fraternity of Christian Doctrine, established by St.
Charles Borromeo in the diocese of Milan. I am acquainted with the
regulations for their establishment in _Acta. Concil. Mediol._, and with
the incidental notices of them which {214} occur in Borromeo's writings,
as also in the later authors, Bishop Burnet, Alban Butler, and Bishop
Wilson (of Calcutta). The numbers of the Sunday schools under the
management of the Confraternity, the number of teachers, of scholars,
the books employed, the occasional rank in life of the teachers, their
method of teaching, and whether any manuals have ever been compiled for
their guidance--are points upon which I would gladly gather any
information.

_Treatise by Englebert, Archbishop of Treves._--Bishop Cosin (in his
_Hist. Trans._ cap. vii. Sec.12) refers to _Engelb. Archiep. Trevirensis,
ap. Goldasti Imper._ tom. i. In Goldast's _Politica Imperialia_ there is
a treatise by S. Engelb. Abb. _Admoutens_ in Austria: but I find neither
the author referred to, nor the treatise intended, by Cosin. According
to Eisengrein, who is followed by Possivinus, there were _two_
Engelberts; viz. Engelbertus, S. Matthiae _Treverensis_, Benedictinae
possessionis Abbus, patria _Mosellanus_, who lived A.D. 987; and S.
Engelbert, who flourished A.D. 1157, and who is described as
_Admontensis_ Benedictinae posessionis Abbus, _Germanus_. Can any of your
correspondents kindly direct me to the intended treatise of the
Archbishop of Treves?

_New Year's Day Custom._--I shall be glad if any of your readers can
inform me of the origin and signification, of the custom of carrying
about decorated apples on New Year's Day, and presenting them to the
friends of the bearers. The apples have three skewers of wood stuck into
them so as to form a tripod foundation, and their sides are ornamented
with oat grains, while various evergreens and berries adorn the top. A
raisin is occasionally fastened on each oat grain, but this is, I
believe, and innovation.

_Under the Rose._--That the English proverbial expression, _Under the
Rose_, is derived from the confessional, is, I believe, generally
admitted: but the authorship of the well-known Latin verses on this
subject is still, as far as I am aware, a _rexata quaestio_, and gives a
somewhat different and _tantaleau_[1] meaning to the adage:--

  "Est Rosa flas Veneris, quem, quo sua furta laterent,
    Harpoerati, Matris dona, dicavit Amor.
  Inde rosam mensis hospes suspendit amicis,
    Convivae ut sub ca dicta tacenda sciant."

inelegant or unclassical lines are to be attributed?

may be found the situation of the places from which the companions of
William the Norman took their names? Such _French_ names as have _De_
prefixed--in fact, a _Gazetteer_? Also, where may be found--if such
exist--pedigrees of the same _worthies_?

_Dr. Johnson's library._--I have long wanted to know what became of the
library of Dr. Samuel Johnson (of our city), or if he had any
considerable collection of books. Perhaps some of your correspondents
would answer both these queries. I happen to have a few, some of which
were used in compiling his Dictionary, and are full of his marks, with
references to the quotations, most of which are to be found in the
Dictionary. I have also his own Prayer-Book.

_Golden Frog._--In the church of Boxstead, in the county of Suffolk,
there is a large and very handsome monument of marble, in a niche of
which stands, in full proportion, a man in armour, his head bare, with
moustaches and a tuft on his chin; in his right hand he holds a
truncheon, and by his side is his sword; his armour is garnished with
gold studs, and his helmet stands on the ground behind him; from his
right ear hangs a _gold frog_.

This monument was erected in memory of Sir John Poley, of Wrongay, in
Norfolk, knight, who died in 1638, at the age of upwards of eighty,
having served much abroad under Henry IV. of France, Christian King of
Denmark, &c., and in Queen Elizabeth's service against the Spaniards.

  "Illius ante alios cepit cum dextera Gades
  Militis Angliaci, et fulmina sensit Iberis."

I send you this detail, in hopes that some of your correspondents may be
able to explain the ornament in his ear, whether it be the badge of any
order, and whether any other instance is known of its use. There is in
Boxstead Hall, the seat of the very ancient family of Poley, a portrait
of Sir John having the same ornament.

_Singular Motto._--Being at Cheltenham in the summer of 1811, I saw a
chariot standing in an inn yard, on the panels of which, under a coat of
arms, apparently belonging to some foreign family, was the following on
a scroll, in the nature of a motto:--"oemn3--ononoe.7 ano--7 emn3." If
any of your correspondents can inform me what is its meaning, and if it
be a motto, to what family it belongs, he will oblige.

collateral branches, if any?

_Antony Alsop._--Will any of your correspondents kindly tell me who
Antony Alsop was? A thin Quarto volume of Latin Odes was published in
1753, with the following title: "Antonii Alsopi AEdis Christi olim Alumni
Ordarum Libri Duo," Londoni, 1753. They are extremely elegant, and
deserving the attention of all lovers of Latin poetry. I have also
another volume, "Latin and English Poems, by a Gentleman of Trinity
College, Oxford," Quarto London, 1738. In this latter volume, with but
two or three exceptions, the poems are very obscene, yet I find one or
two of Alsop's odes in it. Could any of your readers tell me if both
volumes are by the same author? Was Alsop at Trinity College and
subsequently a student of Christ Church?

himself at Oxford, at a peruse."

_Tomlinson, of Southwingfield, Derbyshire._--The parochial register of
the parish of Southwingfield, in the county of Derby, contains, among
its earliest entries (A.D. 1586), the name Tomlinson, as then resident
therein. The family, to the present time, continues to reside within the
parish, as respectable yeomen, and has thence extended itself to many of
the neighbouring parishes, as well as to more distinct localities.
Blore's _History of Southwingfield_ makes no mention of such a family
connected with the parish, as tenants or otherwise; nor does it appear
that there is at present any family of Tomlinson bearing arms that can
have been derived from any of the ancient lords of Wingfield. The wills
at Lichfield, to whose registry Southwingfield belongs, are in a very
dilapidated and unsatisfactory state, at the time immediately preceding
the commencement of the Southwingfield parochial register. Probably some
genealogist will be enabled to offer a suggestion as to the means which
are available for tracing the genealogy of this fanily prior to the year
1586.

_The Phrase "To have a Button in the Room," and "Sally."_--I have again
been reading that most amusing book, _The Lives of the Norths_. At p. 88

Speaking of some law proceedings in which the Lady Dacres was concerned,
Roger North says:--

    "And herein she served herself another way, for her adversary
    defamed her for swearing and unswearing, and it was not amiss to
    _have a button in the room_."

At p. 92. (_post_) there is another strange expression:-- {216}

    "The horse, when he found himself clear of pursuers, stopped his
    course by degrees, and went with his rider (fast asleep upon his
    back) into a pond to drink, and there sat his lordship upon the
    '_sally_.' (Qy. _saddle_?)"

place, except in the Church service, where I have seen the above-named

in one commemorative festival.

    mercy of God June 24th anno Domni 1681."

There is in the possession of an old lady living at Durham, in 1836, an
original note in the handwriting of King Charles the Second, of which
the following is a copy:--

    "Whereas a debte of foure thousande one hundred and fifty pounds
    sterlinge apeares to be remayning dew by the king my father to
    Sir W. Hamilton brother to the Earle of Abercorne for the

_Devices on Standards of the Anglo-Saxons._--Can any of your readers
inform me what devices were borne on the standards of the several
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the so-called Heptarchy? The _white horse_
is by many supposed to have been the standard of Wessex, and to have
been borne by Alfred; but was not this really the ensign of the Jutish
kingdom of Kent, the county of Kent to this day displaying the white
horse in its armorial bearings? The standard of Wessex is by others said
to have been the _white dragon_; but Thierry supposes that this, like
the contrasted _red dragon_ of Cymbri, was merely a poetical
designation, and seems to infer that the flags of these two contending
people were without any device. Again, it has been thought that a _lion_
was the ensign of Northumbria; in which case we may, perhaps, conclude
that the lions which now grace the shield of the city of York have
descended from Anglo-Saxon times. The memory of the Danish standard of
the _Raven_, described by Asser and other Anglo-Saxon chroniclers, still
remains; but whether, when Northumbria and East Anglia fell under Danish
power, this device supplanted previous Anglo-Saxon devices, is a curious
question for antiquarian research. The famous Norwegian standard--the
Landeyda, or ravager of the world--under which Harold Hardrada triumphed
at Fulford, near York, but to fall a few days later at Stanford Bridge,
is well known; but who can inform us as to the device which it bore?
These early traces of heraldic usage appear to deserve more notice than
I believe they have received.

_Burning the Dead._--Can any of your readers, who may have attended

pillaged from the Spanish carrack, which had then recently been captured
and taken into Dartmouth harbour. Amongst these articles is one thus
described:--"An Emerod, made in the form of a cross, three inches in
length at the least, and of great breadth."

In the same volume of MSS. (art. 61.) there is the description of a
dagger "with a hefte of white Caredon."

From the size of the cross described, "Emerod" can scarcely be read
"Emerald," as applied by us to one of the precious stones.

REPLIES

THE FIELD OF FORTY FOOTSTEPS.

The fields behind Montague House were, from about the year 1680, until
towards the end of the last century, the scenes of robbery, murder, and
every species of depravity and wickedness of which the heart can think.
They appear to have been originally called the Long Fields, and
afterwards (about Strype's time) the Southampton Fields. These fields
remained waste and useless, with the exception of some nursery grounds
near the New Road to the north, and a piece of ground enclosed for the
Toxophilite Society, towards the northwest, near the back of Gower
Street. The remainder was the resort of depraved wretches, whose
amusements consisted chiefly in fighting pitched battles, and other
disorderly sport, especially on the Sabbath day. Such was their state in
1800.

Tradition had given to the superstitious at that period a legendary
story of the period of the Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion, of two brothers
who fought in this field so ferociously as to destroy each other; since
which, their footsteps, formed from the vengeful struggle, were said to
remain, with the indentations produced by their advancing and receding;
nor could any grass or vegetable ever be produced where these _forty
footsteps_ were thus displayed. This extraordinary arena was said to be
at the extreme termination of the northeast end of Upper Montague
Street; and, profiting by the fiction, Miss Porter and her sister
produced an ingenious romance thereon, entitled, _Coming Out, or the
Forty Footsteps_. The Messrs. Mayhew also, some twenty years back,
brought out, at the Tottenham Street Theatre, an excellent melodrama
piece, founded upon the same story, entitled _The Field of Forty
Footsteps_.

In 1792, an ingenious and enterprising architect, James Burton, began to
erect a number of houses on the Foundling Hospital estate, partly in St.
Giles's and Bloomsbury parishes, and partly in that of St. Pancras.
_Baltimore House_, built, towards the northeast of _Bedford House_, by
Lord Baltimore, in 1763, appears to have been the only erection since
Strype's survey to this period, with the exception of a
chimney-sweeper's cottage still further north, and part of which is
still to be seen in Rhodes's Mews, Little Guildford Street. In 1800,
Bedford House was demolished entirely; which with its offices and
gardens, had been the site where the noble family of the Southamptons,
and the illustrious Russells, had resided during more than 200 years,
almost isolated. Hence commenced the formation of a fine uniform street,
Bedford Place, consisting of forty houses, on the spot; also, the north
side of Bloomsbury Square, Montague Street to the west, and one side of
Southampton Row to the east. Towards the north, the extensive piece of
waste ground, denominated the _Southampton Fields_, was transformed into
a magnificent square, with streets diverging therefrom in various
directions. Thus, as if by "touch of magic wand," those scenes, which
had been "hideous" for centuries, became transformed into receptacles of
civil life and polished society.

The latest account of these _footsteps_, previous to their being built
over, with which I am acquainted, is the following, extracted from one
of Joseph Moser's _Common-place Books_ in my possession:--

    "June 16. 1800.--Went into the fields at the back of Montague
    House, and there saw, for the last time, the _forty footsteps_;
    the building materials are there ready to cover them from the
    sight of man. I counted more than _forty_, but they might be the
    foot-prints of the workmen."

This extract is valuable, as it establishes the period of the final
demolition of the footsteps, and also confirms the legend that _forty_
was the original number.

QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 4.--"POKERSHIP", BY BOLTON CORNEY.

A query made by so experienced a writer as the noble historian of
_Audley End_, cannot admit of an easy solution; and instead of
professing to answer the two-fold query on _pokership_, it might more
become me to style this note an attempt to answer it.

In the _Historical collections of the noble families of Cavendishe_,
etc. the passage which contains the doubtful word is printed thus:--

    "He [Sir Robert Harley, of Bramton, Herefordshire] was in the
    next year [1604], on the 16th of July, made forester of
    Boringwood, _alias_ Bringwood forest, in com. Hereford, with the
    office of _pokership_, and custody of the forest or chace of
    Prestwood, for life."

Are we to read _parkership_ or _pokership_? If _pokership_, what is its
meaning?

Skelton, the rhymer, has _parker_ for _park-keeper_, so that
_parkership_ is an admissable word; but I reject it on this occasion, as
inapplicable to a forest or chace. I incline to believe that _pokership_
is the true lection. _Poke_ denoted a purse; witness Chaucer:--

  "Gerveis answered; Certes, were it gold,
  Or in a _poke_ nobles all untold,
  Thou shuldest it have."--C.T. v. 3777.

We do not find _poker_ in Barret or Cotgrave; but if _poke_ denoted a
purse, _poker_ might denote a purse-bearer or treasurer, and
_pokership_, the office of purse-bearer. So we have BURSA, [Glossarivm
manvale, 1772. I. 849.] _bursar_, _bursarship_, etc.

MERTENS, MARTINS, OR MARTINI, THE PRINTER.

A correspondent, "W.," in No. 12. p. 185., wishes to learn "the real
surname of Theodoric Mertens, Martins, or Martini, the printer of
Louvain."

In Latin the name is written Theodoricus Martinus; in French, Thierri
Martin; in Flemish, Diedrych Meertens, and occasionally, but I think
incorrectly, Dierix Martens.

In a side chapel of the chancel of the church at Alost, midway between
Brussels and Ghent, is the printer's tomb, and a double inscription, in
Latin and in Flemish, commemorates his celebrity and the dates of his
birth and death; in the Latin inscription the name is Theodoricus
Martinus; in the Flemish, which is very old and nearly effaced, it is
Diedrych Meertens.

The name of _Meertens_, as a surname, is as common in Brabant and
Flanders as that of Martin with us.

A.B.

       *       *       *       *       *

I beg to say that, in Peignot's _Dictionnaire raisonne de Bibliologie_,
the name of the printer Mertens is given as "Martens, Mertens, ou Martin
d'Alost (Thierry), en Latin Theodoricus Martinus." The article is too
long for insertion in your pages, but it contains an account of the
title-page of one of his editions, in 4to., in which the name is spelt
_Mertens_:--"Theo. Mertens impressore." Two other title-pages have "Apud
Theod. M_a_rtinum." So it appears that the printer himself used
different modes of spelling his own name. Erasmus wrote a Latin epitaph
on his friend, in which a graceful allusion is made to his printer's
mark, the anchor:--

ETYMOLOGY OF ARMAGH.

In reply to the inquiry of "D.S.Y." (p. 158. of your 10th number), I beg
to say that the name of Armagh is written, in Irish, Ardmacha, and
signifies the Height (or high ground) of Macha. It is supposed to have
derived this name from Macha Mong-ruadh [i.e. Macha of the red hair],
who was queen of Ireland, according to the Chronology of O'Flaherty,
A.M. 3603.

I.H.T.

Dublin, Jan. 5. 1850.


Sir,--There are the following authorities for different derivations of
the word _Armagh_.

Camden, in his _Britannia_, says:--

    "_Armach_ ab Amarcha regina; sic dictum fabulantur Hibernici; at
    mihi eadem esse videtur quam _Dearmach_ vocat Beda: et _Roborum
    Campum_ ex lingua Scotica sive Hibernica interpretatur, ubi
    circa annum salutis DLX. monaterium extruxit celeberrimum
    Columbanus."

Dr. Keating's _Hist. of Ireland_ has as follows:--

    "_Macha_ the wife of Nemedius died before her son Ainnim ...
    from her _Ardmagh_ received its name, because she was buried in
    that place."

_Circles of Gomer_ (London, 1771), contains as follows:--

    "Ar, and Ararat.--The Earth, country, or upon and on the earth
    ... _Armagh_ on the surrounding water confines."

M. Bullet, _Memoires de la Langue Celtique_, writes thus:--

    "Armagh, Une des plus anciennes villes d'Irland. _Ar_, article.
    _Mag_, ville."--vol. i.

But the 2nd and 3rd vols. of these _Memoires_, which contain the Celtic
Dictionary, afford a more probable interpretation:--

    "_Ar_ or _Ard_ signifies a height, mountain, hill, {219}
    elevation, the highest, noble, chief, &c. &c., and _Ar_ in
    Hebrew, Chaldean, and Armenian, has the same meaning. _Magh_ is
    a field, a plain, ground, &c., as well as a town, dwelling, &c."

Now, the topographical description of the county of Armarh is that it is
_hilly_, and the hills (not very high) are of granite rock. The town of
Armagh again is described as situated on an _eminence_. I suggest,
therefore, _the high field_ or ground, or _the field of the Hill_, or
the dwelling or town of the Hill, as very natural derivations.

If your correspondent prefers it, _Ar_ bears also the signification of
_rock_, and M. Bullet says:--

    "Ce terme nous a ete conserve dans la Vie de Saint Colomb."

Who knows, therefore, whether in building the monastery alluded to by
Camden, he may not have given it the name of

  The dwelling of the Rock?

The Celtic language affords many other possibilities, but an accurate
knowledge of the locality is requisite in judging of their probablility.

HERMES.


The etymology of _Armagh_, in Ireland, is very simple. _Ard_, high,
great, noble, a purely Celtic root, found in many languages. Latin,
_Arduus_, high, &c. Welsh, _hardh_, fair, handsome, &c. _Magh_, a plain,
a level tract of land, a field. _Ardmugh_, the great plain. Others
derive it from _Eamhuin-magh_, from the regal residence of the kings of
Ulster, that stood in its vicinity; but the former is considered by
those best capable of judging as the most correct. The original name was
_Druim-sailech_, "the hill of sallows," which was changed to
_Ard-sailech_, "the height of sallows," and then again to _Ardmagh_.
Although now spelt _Armagh_, it was formerly more correctly written
_Ardmagh_, which is undoubtedly the proper way.

THE OFFICE OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS.

Your esteemed correspondent, "J.G.N.," asks (p. 158.) for the meaning of
the letters "C.K.M.R." and "T.S." appended to the passage he quotes from
the _Common-place Book_ of Charles, Duke of Dorset. I think I can tell
him. "C.K.M.R." stands for _Charles Killegrew_, Master of the Revells;
and "T.S." means _Thomas Skipwith_, one of the patentees of Drury Lane
Theatre, who died in 1710. Sir Henry Herbert died in 1673; and his
successor in the office was Thomas Killegrew. This person had previously
been Sir Henry's deputy; and I am in possession of a curious list of MS.
instructions, "the heads of what I gave to Mr. Thos. Killegrew the 29th
of March, 1664," in the hand-writing of Sir Henry Herbert. Thomas
Killegrew died in 1683, and was succeeded by Charles Killegrew; the
degree of the relationship between the two Killegrews I do not know; and
in the _London Gazette_, Dec. 7. 1685, there is a notice commanding all
"rope-dancers, prize-players, strollers and other persons showing
motions and other sights, to have licenses from Charles Killegrew, Esq.,
Master of the Revells."

Charles Killegrew was one of the managers of Drury Lane Theatre at the
time of the union of the King's and Duke of York's servants; and Drydaen
calls him, in the Dedication to his translation of Juvenal's _Satires_,
his "ingenious friend."

Upon the death of the latter, in 1725, Charles Henry Lee succeeded to
the vacant office; who, dying in 1744, Solomon Dayrolle was appointed in
his room. I do not know the date of the decease of the last-named
gentleman; but with him, I believe, died the office of the Master of the
Revells. The ancient jurisdiction of the Master of the Revells has been
transferred, by 1737, by legal authority, to a "licenser of the stage,"
who, in conjunction with a deputy licenser, performed all the functions
of the ancient office.

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

_The Red Maids of Bristol._--The answer to the query of "MR. A.
GRIFFENHOOF" (No. 12. p. 184.), why the "Red Maids" in Bristol are so
called, is, because they are dressed in bright scarlet gowns. They are
the incumbents of a benevolent school, founded in 1627, by one of
Bristol's great benefactors, Alderman Whitson, of pious memory, for the
maintenance and education of 40 girls, which number has now increased to
120. Your correspondent's curiousity respecting their name might be
fully satisfied, and his interest increased, if he should happen to be
in Bristol on some sunny afternoon in the later part of May, or the
beginning of June, by a sight of this bright "regiment of women"--the
gay colour of their gowns subdued by the quaintness of their fashion,
and the clean whiteness of their aprons, collars, &c.--proceeding, in
double file, towards the downs, for air and recreation. An account of
their foundation may be found in Barret's _Hist. of Bristol_, p. 415.
"Blue-Boys," so called for a similar reason, are a parallel case of much
more general occurance. Yours, &c.

_Poetical Symbolism._--In answer to the question of your correspondent,
"STEPHEN BEAUCHAMP" (No. 11. p. 173.), I beg leave to mention a work,
which answers in some degree to the description which he gives; namely,
_De Symbolica AEgyptiorum Sapientia_, and _Polyhistor Symbolicus,
electarum Symbolarum et Parabolarum Historicurum Stromata XII. Libris
complectens_, by Nicolas Caussin, {220} 8vo. Col. Agr. 1631. There were
other editions, I believe, in the same century. The former work treats
of Egyptian symbols; the titles of the twelve books of the latter are:
I. Mundus et Elementa. II. Dii Gentium. III. Hominis Bona. IV. Hominis
Mala. V. Ritus Gentium. VI. Aves. VII. Quadrupedes. VIII. Pisces. IX.
Serpentes et Insecta. X. Plantae. XI. Lapilli. XII. Manufacta.

_Fraternitye of Vagabondes._--It does not appear very clearly from the
wording of the query at p. 184. of your 12th number, whether the object
of your correspondent, "A. GRIFFINHOOF, JUN.," be to ascertain the fact
of the reprint in question having been published by Stace, or (having
ascertained that fact) to procure further information as to the
publisher. I cannot find any allusion to the work in the _Censura
Literuria_, (2nd ed. 1815), another instance of the absolute necessity
for exact references, the want of which you would do well in making a
ground of exclusion from your columns. However, on the chance of being
useful I send you an exact copy of the rubricated title-page of the
reprint, which is as follows:

    "The Fraternitye of Vacabondes; As wel of ruflyng Vacabondes, as

Ravennas_, with other ancient scraps of geography, annexed to a neat
edition of _Pomponius Mela_, printed at Leyden, in 1696. Gronovius
refers the _anonymous_ author to the seventh century. His _Chorography
of Britain_ forms a part of the work; but it is printed from one MS.,
and wretchedly obscure.

_Dick Shore._--Your correspondent, J.T. HAMMACK, is not quite correct in
stating, No. 9., p. 141., that the modern maps present no trace of the
locality of "_Dick Shoare_," mentioned in the Pepysian _Diary_. In one
of Smith's maps, now before me, of the date of 1806, I find "Duke Shore
Stairs," not far from the great turn of the river southward, opposite to
the Isle of Dogs. Whether the proper spelling to be Dick, Dyke, Dock,
Dog, or Duke, I leave to your readers to determine; but I presume there
can be no doubt as to the identity of the place. As the origin of the
name of "Isle of Doggs," according to the Pepysian orthography, is said
to be still underdetermined; may it not be connected with the modern
term DOCKS? We are daily familiarised to worse corruptions. _Docks_ are
excavations, large or small, formed by the operation of digging, in
Dutch called _Doken_.

_Sanuto._--The _Ragguagli sulla Vita e sulle Opere di Maria Sanuto_,
referred to in No. 5., p. 75., were edited by Mr. Rawdon Browne, an
English gentleman long resident at Venice, and a most accomplished
Italian scholar. The _Diary of Sanuto_ could hardly be printed, filling,
as it does, some twenty or thirty thick large folio volumes.

_Lord Chatham's Speech on the American Stamp Act._--When I read the

correct, our historians must forthwith re-write a somewhat important
chapter in our history. I felt assured, however, that it was not
correct; and the result of a somewhat tedious search is as I had
anticipated. His lordship had made an error in a date and 1764 should be
1766. The authority, not acknowledged by his lordship, was, no doubt,
the _Parliamentary History of_ 1766 (vol. xvi. p. 96.), where your
correspondent will find the statement, which of course, the date being
correctly given, contains nothing that is not consistent with known
facts.

_Bone-houses._--The number of skulls at Rothewell (No. 11., p. 171.) is
greatly exaggerated, nor is the tradition of their being gathered from
Naseby battle-field more than a modern invention, the discovery of the
bones being within the memory of living persons. Their existence there
is most puzzling. The vault, which is very small, is probably coeval
with the church, and seems to have been made for the very purpose to
which it is applied. When this vast building was erected in the 12th
century, may not this vault have been made for the bones disturbed in
the old churchyard by so extensive a foundation?

_Queen's Messengers._--In answer to the query of your correspondent

Armes," to which he alludes, in Mr. C. Knight's _London_. He will find
that he is referred to Legh's _Accedens of Armory_, and Upton, _De
Studio Militari_. The latter wrote in the early part of the fifteenth
century. We are at present, I believe, without earlier information on
such subjects.

Whilst I am writing to you, may I ask you to correct a printer's error
in my query in the same number, where "trepon" appears instead of
"jupon"? It may save a query as to what I could mean by the former.

III., or early in Anne's reign), there is a representation of "_La
Laitiere de May a Londres_," with an enormous head-dress of silver
dishes, tankards, and cups, intermixed with flowers. There is no
letter-press explanation; but it is evident that the practice of the
milk-maids, in carrying their mail-pails balanced on their heads,
suggested the idea of carrying this more precious burthen in _gala_ on
May-day.

MISCELLANIES.

_Gray's Elegy._--Your correspondent, "A. GRAYAN" (No. 10., p. 150.), in
writing on the _Elegy in a Country Church-yard_, suggests the existence
of error or obscurity in the last stanza of the epitaph; and that, if
the reading, as it now stand, be faulty, "some amendment" should be
suggested.

At the sale of Mason's collection of Gray's books and MSS., in December,
1845, I purchased Gray's copy of Dodsley's collection (2nd edition,
1758), with corrections, names of authors, &c., in his own hand. The
_Elegy_ is the first poem in vol. iv. In the 2nd stanza, the beetle's
"_drony_ flight" is printed and corrected in the margin into "droning."
In the 25th stanza, an obvious misprint of "the upland land" is
corrected into "upland lawn;" and, in the 27th stanza, "he would rove"
is altered into "would he rove." These are the only emendations in the
_Elegy_. The care displayed in marking them seems to me indicate that
the author had no others to insert, and that the common reading is as he
finally left it.

To say that a man's merits and frailties repose in trembling hope before
God, is surely not irreverent; and this is, I think, all that Gray
intended to convey in the words to which your correspondent objects.

W.L.M.

    [The latter emendation "would he rove," which is neither in the
    Aldine edition of the Rev. J. Mitford, nor in Mr. Van Voorst's
    beautifully illustrated Polyglot edition, should clearly be
    introduced, in future, as harmonising more perfectly with the
    "would he stretch" of the preceding stanza.]


_Gray's Elegy._--To the list of German translations of Gray's Elegy
should be added the version by Kosegarten, which is said by Mr. Thimm,
in his _View of German Literature_, to be "very spirited." The edition
of Kosegarten i have now before me was printed at Greifswald, in 12
vols. in 1824, and contains numerous translations from English poets.

_Gregori's Italian Version of "Gray's Elegy."_--In answer to the query

those in Torri's polyglot edition, there is one in Italian by Domenico
Gregori, published in the first volume of his _Scelta di Poesie di piu
celebri Autori Inglesi, recati in Versi Italiani_, and printed at Rome
in 1821, in 2 vols. small 8vo.

_Name of Shylock._--When Mr. Knight says that _Scialac_ was "the name of
a Marionite (Maronite?) of mount Libanus," he appears to consider the
{222} term peculiar, or nearly so, to that personage; but Upton, as long
ago as 1748, in his _Critical Observations_, 2nd ed. p. 299., remarked,
that _Scialac_ was the generic name, and _Shylock_ merely a corruption.
I may also remark, that Mr. Knight dismisses Dr. Farmer's theory as
worthless, without sufficient consideration. It by no means follows that
1607 is the date of the _first edition_ of _Caleb Shillocke_, merely
because Boswell saw a copy bearing that date.

was respectively 854 and 311. I do not know what it was in 1767.

_Praise undeserved._--Does any one know where the oft-quoted line,

is to be found? A long search for it has hitherto proved ineffectual.

D.S.

    [This line, which is so often quoted, with the variation--

      "Praise undeserved is _Satire_ in disguise,"

    is to be found in Pope's _First Epistle of the Second Book of
    Horace_; where, however, we find that neither _Censure_ nor
    _Satire_ is the correct reading. It is moreover, both in
    Warton's edition and in the _Aldine Poets_, edited by the Rev.
    A. Dyce, marked as a quotation, as will be seen in the following
    extract; so that Pope, it appears, is not the author of it.
    Perhaps some of our correspondents can trace the source from
    which he derived it:--

      "Besides, a fate attends on all I write,
      That when i aim at praise they say I bite.
      A vile encomium doubly ridicules;
      There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools.
      If true, a woeful likeness; and, if lies,
      'Praise undeserved is _Scandal_ in disguise.'"]


_Passage in Cowper's "Task."_--In all early editions of Cowper's _Task_
the opening lines of the 4th book are punctuated as follows:--

  "Hark! 'tis the twanging horn! O'er yonder bridge,
  (That with its wearisome but needful length
  Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon
  Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright,)
  He comes, the herald of a noisy world," &c.

In modern editions, I believe universally, we find the following
corruption of the passage:--

  "Hark! 'tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge,
  That with," &c.

closing with a colon or period at "bright," and {223} beginning a new
sentence with "He comes;" and thus making the poet use the vulgar
colloquialism "'tis the horn over the bridge," instead of the remark,
that the postman is coming over it.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

All who have placed on their shelves--and who that desires to know
thoroughly the history of this country during the period which it
illustrates has not done so--the last edition of _The Diary and
Correspondence of Samuel Pepys_, so ably edited by Lord Braybrooke, have
felt the want of a corresponding edition of _Evelyn's Diary_. To meet
this want, Mr. Coulburn has announced a new edition of it, "rendered as
complete as possible by a careful revision," and accompanied by
illustrative notes, to be completed in four monthly volumes.

Mr. Parker, of Oxford, has just issued a new edition of _The History of
the Church of England_, by J.B.S. Carwithen, B.D. This work was very
highly spoken of, at the time of its first appearance, for fidelity of
narrative, accuracy of judgement, and soundness of principle; and its
author was pronounced, by one well qualified to give an opinion, "a
well-read historian, a sound divine, a charitable Christian." As the
original edition, in three volumes, has long been out of print, we think
Mr. Parker has shown great judgment in bringing it out, in a cheaper
form, for the use of students in divinity; and we do not doubt but that
he will find a ready sale for the two closely but clearly and handsomely
printed volumes, in which this _History of the Church of England_ is now
completed.

Those of our readers who take an interest in the writings of our early
dramatists will be glad to learn that the Rev. Alexander Dyce has at
length completed, in three volumes, his long-looked-for edition of _The
Dramatic Works of Kit Marlowe_.

Such of our clerical friends as have in their churches a peal of bells
which, at the will of the ringers,

  "Speak the loud language of a mighty knell,"

and who must, therefore, sometimes be painfully convinced of the ill
practices which occasionally grow up in the belfry, will thank us for
calling their attention to the _Practical Remarks on Belfries and
Ringers_, lately published, by the Rev. H.T. Ellacombe, in which they
will find some useful hints for the correction of such abuses.

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

FOLK LORE. _We have received several letters, begging us to open our
columns to the reception of articles and notes on our fast-fading_ FOLK
LORE, _and reminding us what good service_ The Athenaeum _did when it
consented to receive communications of that interesting subject. We
acknowledge with gratitude--for the point is one very interesting to
us--the readiness with which_ The Athenaeum _listened to the suggestions
of a Correspondent, and what benefits resulted to that interesting
branch of Archaeological study, when that influential journal consented
to devote a portion of its valuable space to the reception of such
notices. We at once, therefore, accede to the suggestions of our
Correspondent; and, following the example of our widely circulated
contemporary, take this opportunity of assuring our now numerous readers
that any contributions illustrative of_ The Folk Lore of England, _the
Manners, Customs, Observances, Superstitions, Ballads, Proverbs, &c. of
the Olden Time, will always find welcome admission to our pages. We
think, too, we may venture to promise that such communications shall be
illustrated, when they admit of it, from the writings of the continental
antiquaries_.

J.D.A. _is informed that we purpose so arranging_ "NOTES AND QUERIES"
_as to form two volumes in the course of the year; each volume to be
accompanied by a_ VERY COPIOUS INDEX.

EMDEE _will see that we have at once so far availed ourselves of his
suggestion as to make_ REPLIES _a distinct department of our paper. The
other change he suggests requires consideration; which it shall
certainly have_.

_We are unavoidably compelled to postpone until our next Number, Mr.
Hickson's further communication on_ Marlowe and the Old Taming of a
Shrew.

T.S.N. _will find much curious information on the subject of his inquiry
in some of the later volumes of_ The Gentleman's Magazine; _and we will
take an early opportunity of furnishing him with information upon the
point_.

_We are compelled, by want of space, to omit our usual acknowledgment
of_ COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED.

_We are again compelled to omit many Notes, Queries, and Answers to
Queries which are in type, as well as Answers to Correspondents_.

PLAIN SERMONS, addressed to a Country Congregation. By the late REV.
EDWARD BLENCOWE, Curate of Teversal, and formerly Fellow of Oriel
College, Oxford.

"Their style is simple--the sentences are not artfully constructed--and
there is an utter absence of all attempts at rhetoric. The language is
plain Saxon language, from which 'the men on the wall' can easily gather
what it most concerns them to know.... In the statements of Christian
doctrine, the reality of Mr. Blencowe's mind is very striking. There is
a strength, and a warmth, and a life, in his mention of the great truths
of the Gospel, which show that he spoke from the heart, and that, like
the apostle of old, he could say, 'I believe, and therefore have I
spoken.'"--_Theologian._

SERMONS. By ALFRED GATTY, M.A., Vicar of Ecclesfield.

"Sermons of a high and solid character, and are the production of a good
Churchman. They are earnest and affectionate, and follow out the
Church's doctrine."--_Theologian._

"Warm hearted and thoughtful."--_Guardian._

SHORT SERVICES FOR FAMILY WORSHIP; arranged chiefly from the Book of
Common Prayer, With a Prefatory Address. By JOHN GIBSON, B.D., Vicar of
Brent-with-Furneux Pelham, Herts; late Fellow and Tutor of Sidney Sussex
College, Cambridge.

The aim of this selection is to furnish a set of Services that will take
in all the great subjects of Family Prayer, and so short that the
busiest household may have time for its devout utterance. It will be
found suitable for those who have hitherto neglected the duty of Family
Prayer.

THE DEVOTIONAL LIBRARY. Edited by WALTER FARQUHAR HOOK, D.D., Vicar of
Leeds.

The Devotional Library was commenced in 1846. The design of the
Proprietors was to publish, at the lowest possible price, a series of
Works, original, or selected from well-known Church of England Divines,
which, from their practical character, as well as their cheapness, would
be peculiarly useful to the clergy for parochial distribution. Since
that period the following have appeared:--

Helps to Self-Examination, 1/2d.                      Original
The Sum of Christianity, 1d.                          A. Ellis.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
