[Transcriber's note:

This was a catalog from a magazine subscription agency MANY
YEARS AGO. It is presented in order to show a cross section of
the periodicals for the general public, and some professional
journals, published in the USA at that time, and the kinds of
subscription prices they asked. Obviously, the offers are NO
LONGER AVAILABLE and most of these periodicals are no longer
published! The only other thing I know about Mr. Cottrell is
that he was apparently an avid player of horseshoe pitching.

The booklet had 40 octavo size pages and there were two forms
inserted loose into its pages; the contents of those forms
appear at the end of this document. The booklet itself had
four kinds of content. 1) Instructions and self-promotion by
D. D. Cottrell. 2) Advertisements inserted by various
publishers. 3) An extensive alphabetical list of the
American publications offered via the company. 4) An extensive
variety of "club lists"--offers of an even more special price
on particular combinations of two or more magazines, not
necessarily from the same publisher. This was a common
practice at the time. Comments in square brackets, other than
the footnotes, were added during the process of transcribing
the booklet to an etext. Enough blathering; here follows the
actual contents of the booklet.]

MY CLUBBING OFFERS

This is the TWENTIETH YEAR that I have been in the subscription
business, and in this Catalogue No. 39, I am giving the best bargains in
periodical literature that have ever been placed before the public. In
order to enable me to do this the publishers of these periodicals have
sacrificed their prices until in a great many cases they do not obtain
from the subscribers to these club offers the actual cost of the white
paper on which they print the numbers that they will mail to fill the
year's subscriptions. They have done this to introduce their periodicals
to the largest number of readers possible, believing it better to give
the subscriber the benefit of the price than to spend the thousands of
dollars in advertising, which would be necessary to secure the same
number of subscriptions and the same amount of publicity. This catalogue
will be sent to a number of hundred thousand persons besides the tens of
thousands of my regular customers, a large number of whom have sent me
orders regularly for years.

My close relations with publishers, my immense business, my unequalled
facilities for handling orders, my long experience in this work, my
thousands of satisfied customers located in all parts of the United
States and Canada and in nearly every civilized country of the world all
combined guarantee that all dealings with me will be satisfactory. My
motto has always been that a satisfied customer was my best
advertisement. On account of these things, publishers give me the lowest
possible prices on periodicals, and I guarantee to my customers that my
prices to them are the lowest obtainable.

I hope to receive the orders, whether they be large or small, of all my
old customers and also of all others who receive this Catalogue, and
hereby promise to give the same my most careful and immediate attention.

Hoping that I may serve you in this matter, I remain,

Very truly yours,

D. D. COTTRELL.

The BOOKLOVERS MAGAZINE

We heartily recommend this brilliant young monthly, now closing its
second year. It is the newest magazine success, and we believe you will
like it. Every month it presents a series of the most remarkable color
pictures ever produced in this country. These popular and artistic
reproductions are made directly from originals which cost, in many
instances, thousands of dollars. There is always at least one good long
story of intense human interest, one or more profusely illustrated
articles of international importance, and penetrating discussions of
vital topics touching present-day interests. One popular section
contains "The Best New Things from the World of Print"--in all at least
150 pages monthly, all profusely illustrated. THE BOOKLOVERS MAGAZINE is
built distinctly for people whose spirit, taste and culture qualify them
to appreciate the best things in picture, story, and informing article.
The publishers have determined that it will always be the newest
magazine. If it finds itself getting old it will begin all over again.
In this way THE BOOKLOVERS MAGAZINE will continue to be, as is it is
now, "The Magazine that is Different"--in the right way.

OUTING

THE OUTDOOR MAGAZINE OF HUMAN INTEREST

EDITED BY CASPAR WHITNEY

Is not like any other magazine you ever saw. Healthy outdoor pictures,
expressive photographs, brilliant drawings, thrilling tales of travel
and adventure, distinguished and exclusive contributors and a broad
human appeal to lovers of the outdoor world--these are but half the
magazine. A year of OUTING will make you an outdoor man or woman,
practical articles, by men like John Burroughs, Stewart Edward White,
and Caspar Whitney will tell you how to sail a boat, swim, skate, hunt,
walk, play golf and tennis; how to enjoy camps and dogs and horses; how
to breathe God's air and be happy, healthy and strong.

hemispheres. Its SHORT STORIES are matchless--clean and full of
human interest. Its POETRY, covering the entire field of
verse--pathos, love, humor, tenderness--is by the most popular poets,
men and women, of the day. Its JOKES, WITTICISMS, SKETCHES, etc.,
are admittedly the most mirth-provoking.

or wearying essays and idle discussions. EVERY page will
INTEREST, CHARM and REFRESH you. It is not a class
magazine, but appeals to all lovers of bright, wholesome fiction. Send

LITTLE FOLKS

LITTLE FOLKS is a magazine for children from three to ten. It goes into
six times as many homes as any similar publication ever issued in
America. It has absorbed all its predecessors of any importance. It has
been published seven years--long enough to prove whether it has reason
for existing.

It has been successful because it is just what the children like, and
the mothers, too.  It is full of delightful stories and beautiful
pictures (all new) by the best authors and artists. There are no
"scarey" stories, or stories of bad children.

It is handsomely printed on the best paper. Every number contains one or
more beautiful pictures in color.

A booklet containing many letters from mothers who have had LITTLE FOLKS
in their families (telling why they like it) and a sample copy, free.
Price, $1.00 a year. Agents wanted.

SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE FOR 1905.

It is not necessary to give assurance to the Magazine-reading public of
the superior quality of the contents of SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE. It is the
leading high-grade Magazine, and as such it has built steadily up to a
circulation today of 200,000. In the high quality and varied interest of
its text, and in the beauty of its illustrations it stands alone. Its
fiction is written by the leading authors of the day, or by new authors
of promise. Its special articles on live topics of the time are written
by men of authority and distinction; it has always been celebrated for
its short fiction and verse. SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE is a progressive
periodical, and it presents not only the best work of celebrated
writers, but the interesting new things in literature. Many of the
notable authors of today have become known first through their work in
SCRIBNER'S. On this account its pages command the universal respect and
attention of the reading public. In the field of illustration it has
many imitators, but no equal. It has always been the leader in fine
color work, and both in the distinction of the artists represented and
the quality of the reproduction and printing of illustrations it leads
in the field of periodical literature. The year of 1905 will be a
notable one in the history of SCRIBNER'S. There will be a new novel by
Mrs. Wharton, an event of unusual importance in the field of Magazine
literature. Selections from the diaries and letters of George Bancroft
will be published. This is a notable contribution to the history of the
century, and a publication that many have been awaiting with eagerness.
There will be a series of important papers on European political
questions of interest to American readers by F.A. Vanderlip, the author
of a new series of letters from Mme. Waddington, the author (1903) of
the most brilliant book of social letters published in recent years.

Mr. John Fox, who has been the representative of SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE on
the Japanese side of the war in the Far East, will publish the result of
his experience in several important articles. Mr. T. F. Millard will
follow his articles on the Russian side by other interesting matters on
the subject. In the field of illustration a feature of special interest
will be a collection of remarkable photographs of the American Indian,
made by Mr. E. S. Curtis, presenting a remarkable pictorial record of
the pure Indian types. It would be impossible in a limited space to give
any idea of the vast amount of attractive special articles and fiction
to appear during the year, or the list of celebrated authors and artists
who will contribute. The superiority of SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE in its field
gives assurance of the very best in art and literature.

The Christmas number will be one of the most beautiful that any American
Magazine has ever published, and all subscribers are urged to date their
subscriptions so as to include this exquisite number.

SUBSCRIPTION PRICE $3.00 A YEAR

An illustrated prospectus describing fully the prominent features of
SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE for 1905 will be sent to any address on application.

or newsdealers' name and address. This we mail prepaid for 5 cents per

and retails generally for 1.00. It can be used for a great many

300 names, ruled for entering all subscriptions. By using this register
you always have a complete record of the names address, name of
periodical, date sent, price received, etc., of all orders you send to

THERE IS SOMETHING REMARKABLE when a magazine can treble its
circulation in four years. Four years ago the circulation of MCCALL'S
MAGAZINE--Fashions and Literature for Ladies--was 200,000. Today
the circulation is more than SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES A MONTH.

Every lady who receives McCall's Magazine has paid for it in advance
50 CENTS FOR ONE YEAR.

While there are six hundred thousand women who pay in advance to receive
McCall's Magazine regularly we believe there are many times this number
who would subscribe had they an opportunity of seeing a copy. We will
send--without charge--a recent issue to every lady who asks us--a postal
card will do. When you see a copy you will know why so many ladies look
upon McCall's Magazine as a necessity.

AS TO A GREAT DEAL FOR A LITTLE

Suppose a book canvasser should come to your door and offer you two
volumes as large as Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, containing nearly a
thousand pages in each volume, and illustrated with ten thousand
pictures that interested you; and suppose that within the limits of the
volumes there would be the equivalent of a book on dressmaking
(carefully illustrated), a book on millinery (carefully illustrated), a
book on dress fabrics, a book on fancy work, a book giving all the
latest news of New York, London and Paris as related to fashions, a book
of Stories and Pastimes for Children, a book of Cookery and Kitchen
Information, a book on House-building and House-furnishing; and then
suppose that, in addition to all this, the book canvasser should point
out that in his two large volumes there were over six hundred pages of
stories, poems and literary articles, the latest advice regarding Club
Women and Club Life, and, above all, three thousand pictures of styles
for all the family, and of hats for women and children, the whole
beautifully printed, with many pages in colors on excellent paper; then
if this book canvasser should tell you that these two great volumes--a
real cyclopedia of all that a woman wishes to read about--could be yours
for a dollar, wouldn't it almost suggest to your mind a doubt of his
sincerity?

But you cannot doubt our sincerity--and for a moment we are this
supposed book canvasser.

The next twelve issues of The Delineator, covering one year's
subscription, give you all (except semi-annual binding) that we have
described above, and much more that is unspecified.

_THE NEW YORK FAMILY STORY PAPER FOR 1904-5._

FOUNDED in 1873 the NEW YORK FAMILY STORY PAPER is the only literary
weekly of its kind which has maintained its pre-eminent position; others
have passed away, but THE NEW YORK FAMILY STORY PAPER continues as ever
the first in circulation and excellence of its contents.

During the coming Fall and Winter season, we shall make a feature of
publishing a less number of serial stories, giving more space to
_Longer Instalments_ of each continued story and publishing a
greater number of short stories in each issue. Our usual departments,
including _Legal Aid_ will be kept up to their high standard. The
FAMOUS PICTORIAL REVIEW PATTERNS, worth from 15 to 30 cents each,
are sold exclusively to our readers for ten cents each. These are the
only tissue patterns cut on French models. They are the only patterns
that give artistic lines to the figure and French CHIC to the wearer. A
home-made dress will not look "Home-Made" if you use Pictorial Review
Patterns.

_A NEW STORY BEGINS EVERY WEEK_ So that any time you begin
reading the paper, you can always find in it the opening chapters of a
fascinating romance by a famous American author.

MCCLURE'S

"Having conceived the idea of investigating and describing from an
unbiased standpoint the dangerous tendencies in American life," says the
_Norfolk Dispatch_, "Mr. McClure enlisted the service of an
editorial staff consisting of Ida M. Tarbell, probably the most talented
woman writer of history that this country has produced; of Ray Stannard
Baker, whose reputation for the clear and popular presentation of
difficult topics of a scientific and abstract nature is world-wide; and
of Lincoln Steffens, a man who stands at the head either of the class of
literary men who possess a nose for news or of newspaper men who have a
turn for literature."

In 1905 all of these well-known writers will continue with McClure's.
Ida M. Tarbell will contribute an extraordinary character sketch of John
D. Rockefeller; Ray Stannard Baker, more of his authoritative labor
articles, and Lincoln Steffens, the political stories of Rhode Island,
Montana, and other states. Samuel Hopkins Adams, a new member of the
staff, will write on Modern Surgery, Tuberculosis, Typhoid Fever, and
Pneumonia.

The _New York World_ says that "the fiction of McClure's is of the
brightness readers expect and always find." In 1905 there will be at
least six stories in every number, by Stewart Edward White, George
Madden Martin, Myra Kelly, Josephine Daskam Bacon, Mary Raymond Shipman
Andrews, Henry Wallace Phillips, O. Henry, Alice Brown, Eugene Wood,
Marion Hill, Alice Hegan Rice, Rex E. Beach, Mary Stewart Cutting, and
others.

Edwin LeFevre, author of the "Wall Street Stories," will soon have a
serial in McClure's--"The Golden Flood"--an exciting mystery story of a
man who deposits a million dollars a day. Booth Tarkington, author of
"The Gentleman From Indiana," has a great series of political stories to
tell. James Hopper will give McClure's the first literary product of the
Philippines. He is going to do for the Philippines what Jack London did
for the Klondike. Henry Harland, author of "The Cardinal's Snuff-Box,"
is working on a new serial for McClure's.

The two great periodicals published by The Century Co.
Union Square, New York


The Century Magazine

There is always one by which the rest are measured. In the magazine
world, that one has always been and is to-day THE CENTURY. Ask writers
where their best productions are first offered; ask editors which
magazine they would rather conduct; ask public men where articles carry
most influence; ask artists where they would prefer to be represented;
ask the public what magazine is the first choice among people of real
influence, and the answer to each question is the same: "THE CENTURY."

Are you going to have the best in 1905?

The new volume of THE CENTURY begins with November number. Yearly
subscription, $4.00. A new serial story by the author of "Mrs. Wiggs of
the Cabbage Patch" begins in December,--don't miss it. New features
beginning all the time.



"I do not know any publication where a bright-minded child can get so
much profit as in its fascinating pages."

St. Nicholas

A MAGAZINE FOR YOUNG FOLKS

Edited by Mary Mapes Dodge

Beautifully Illustrated

Price $3.00 a year

The inspiration of childhood, a supplement to school education,
interpreting to the young reader the world of nature, literature, and
art in terms he can understand, and omitting only what does not make for
true manhood and womanhood. No prig, but a jolly companion, the joy of
healthy boys and girls and a blessing to the lonely child or little
invalid. _Try it this year._

The new fairy story by the author of "The Wizard of Oz" begins in
November,--superbly illustrated in color; runs through the year. One of
many attractions.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
