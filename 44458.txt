PREFATORY NOTE


This pamphlet has been prepared by Mr. Edward F. Strange, of the
Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design, for use primarily in
connection with a collection of Tools, Materials and Examples, specially
brought together and now exhibited in the Museum, to illustrate the
technique of Japanese Colour-printing from wood-blocks. The descriptive
matter has been somewhat amplified, in order to render it of value to
those who cannot immediately refer to the Museum collections.

The works of reference consulted, are named herein; and acknowledgment
must also be made to Mr. Hogitaro Inada, for translations from the
Japanese, kindly supplied by him.

HISTORICAL NOTE


The process of colour-printing from wood-blocks, used in Japan from the
early part of the 18th century, has much in common with that of the
so-called _chiaroscuro_ wood-cuts first produced in Italy and Germany
during the 16th century, of which the work of Andrea Andreani (1540-1623)
supplies good examples. It is possible that the Japanese method was
derived from this source, either directly or by way of China. Japanese
tradition ascribes the invention to Takekawa Minosuke (Manji Period, A.D.
1658-1660); and a volume of Costume Designs in the Museum, dated 1667 (O4.
C. 20), is printed in colours, only one, however, being used on each
plate. The Chinese are known, with certainty, to have employed this
process before the end of the 17th century; but no Japanese colour-print
has yet been recorded, which can be placed, authentically, earlier than
the second quarter of the 18th century. Credit for the first production of
them is generally given to Torii Kiyonobu (1664-1729); but the greatest
development was due to Suzuki Harunobu (died A.D. 1770, aged 67 years).
Japanese authorities say that the improvements popularized by this artist
were invented by an engraver named Kinroku, in conjunction with a printer;
and that Harunobu, employing them to reproduce his pictures, about the
year 1765, thus laid the foundation of a school of artists who found their
chief occupation in designing for this class of work. Katsugawa Shunsho
(died A.D. 1792, aged 67 years) developed the process still further; and
it reached its highest technical level before the close of the 18th
century. Soon after the year 1800, a gradual decline is seen; which
manifested itself both in the increase of the number of blocks used, and
in the loss of quality in the colours. However, many prints of remarkably
high technical excellence were still produced up to about the year 1864;
soon after which time, all refinement both of engraving and printing seems
to have been lost. The last 20 years or so, have, however, witnessed a
sort of revival, by no means without merit in its way; and the adaptation
of the process to the requirements of book-illustration and the
reproduction of works of art, has reached a remarkably high standard in
such publications as the _Kokka_ and those of the _Shimbi ShoIin._

It is not unimportant to add that this process, sometimes modified in
detail, has been revived in Europe; and is now practised by a considerable
number of artists. The Department of Engraving, Illustration, and Design
contains a representative collection of their productions, including a
consecutive set of working proofs (E. 20-26, 1904) of a print by Mr. J. D.
Batten and Mr. Morley Fletcher, who were the first to use the method in
England. The collection also includes a similar set of working proofs of
the modern development of the process, as used for the reproduction of
paintings by Old Masters by the _Shimbi ShoIin_(E. 1862-2043, 1910).

THE DRAWING


Designs for Japanese colour-prints were made by artists, who, as a rule,
were adherents of the Popular _(Ukiyoye)_ School and, socially, of the
rank of artisans. The drawing was done with a brush on very thin _Mino_ or
_Gampi_ paper, the colours used being washes of water-colour worked with
rice-paste medium. To correct the design, the portions to be altered were
covered with pieces of paper, on which the revised drawing was made.  The
completed design (generally, to begin with, in black lines only, or with
only a little tint as a guide to the engraver) was then fastened face
downwards on the block with rice starch weakened with water. As much as
possible of its upper surface was rubbed away, some oil being used to make
the remainder more translucent, and thus to enable the engraver more
easily to follow the lines of the drawing.

It is evident that this process resulted in the destruction of the
designs. The Museum, however, has acquired a number of unused drawings,
which fully illustrate this stage; and the series of blocks exhibited (E.
4136-4322, 1909) have, in several instances, remains of the paper still
adhering to the uncut portions of their surfaces.

CUTTING THE BLOCK


The engraving was invariably done by a second person and not by the
designer.

The wood used was that of the wild cherry _(Yamazakura),_ the timber of
which was not allowed to be exposed to sunshine, but was carefully
seasoned in the shade. Fig. 1 illustrates the most economical way of
cutting up logs into blocks; the harder portions of the wood--those nearer
the centre--being used for the key-blocks (see p. 10), and the softer for
the colour-blocks. When possible, wood from the same tree was used for all
the blocks in each series. The outlines of the drawing were incised with a
knife-edged graver, and the superfluous wood then hollowed out with
chisels or gouges of various form, for all practical purposes, identical
with those used by European wood-carvers. The result is an intaglio block,
the printing-surfaces alone remaining in relief.

             [DIAGRAM:--Method of cutting a log into blocks. ]

              DIAGRAM:--Method of cutting a log into blocks.


The block first made from the drawing is called the key-block _(Daiban)_
and gives, in relief, the lines only, of the design. From it a number of
proofs are taken, one for each colour-printing to be made. On each of
these proofs the separate portion of the design covered by one colour is
painted; and is then pasted on a block and cut in the manner described
above. Every part of the surface of the block, however, which is not
required for the one colour in use, is cut away.

To produce a colour print, therefore, a key-block is required and also a
separate block for each colour in the design. For the sake of economy,
colour-blocks are sometimes cut on both sides; and, for small details, two
portions of the design may be cut on one side, but only one colour is
printed at each operation.

In the actual cutting of the block, the old Japanese engraver adhered to
an important principle--that of following the direction of the brush
strokes of the original drawing, in such a manner as to reproduce the
actual quality of the brush-mark. This is less apparent in the ordinary
colour-prints; but in reproductions, by the same process, of paintings and
drawings, the results obtained are extraordinarily faithful to the
originals.

Blocks were often framed, to prevent warping, in the manner illustrated in
fig. 2. This device was more generally employed in the case of those
especially made for book-illustration. A block that had warped could often
be straightened out again, by being well soaked in water and then placed
under a weight.

PRINTING


The Printing of the old colour-prints was done by a third person, neither
the engraver nor the designer.

The finished block must first be thoroughly washed and dried. The colour
is then applied with a brush, to the upper surface of the block, which
rests on a low stand _(Suridai)_ to which are affixed four small cushions
of wet cotton _(Yawara)_ to prevent slipping (fig. 6). This stand should
have a downward slope of about 2 inches in 1 foot. The paper is wetted,
about 6 hours before being used for printing, and hung up to drain. For
the actual printing, it is laid on the upper surface of the block,
register _(Kento)_ being secured by means of an angular cut at one corner
(Plate III.) called the "key" _(kaji)_; and a line cut at another, called
the "draw-close line" _(hikitsuki)._  No other means of adjustment is
used, but the skill of the old printers was so great that faults of
register can very seldom be observed. The impression is then rubbed off
with the _Baren,_ used with a circular or zig-zag movement (fig. 5); and
this operation is repeated in succession with each block, beginning with
the key-block, until the prints are complete.

It is the modern, and was probably the old practice, to take the required
number of proofs from each block in succession; and not to complete each
print separately. The writer has observed that a modern Japanese printer
takes an impression in from 15 to 25 seconds, without special effort.

The colours used were as follows:--

      CARMINE _(Beni)._ Made from the Safflower, Carthamus tinctorius,
      from which rouge is also prepared. The kind called _Saiku-Beni_ is
      generally mixed with an acid derived from the Plum-fruit
      _(Mukiume)._
      BLUE _(Ao)_. Both _AiroI_(indigo) and _Hero_ (European blue) are now
      used. The old indigo was sometimes extracted from dyed rags.
      YELLOW _(Ki)._ Generally _Zumi,_ a yellow dye, and _Kiwo,_ orpiment,
      are used, and _ShiwoI,_ gamboge, for the best prints.
      PURPLE _(Murasaki)._ Formerly this colour was made by mixing
      _Aigami_ (blue) and _Beni_ (red), but now an imported purple is
      used.
      GREEN _(Midori)._ A mixture of either _Hero_ and _Kiwo,_ or _Zumi_
      and _AiroI._
      ORANGE YELLOW   _(ToI-oI)._ Produced by mixing _Zumi_ and _Bengara_
      (iron red) or _Zumi_ and _Yenji_ (rouge).
      BLACK _(Sumi)_. _Yeizen Zumi_(lamp-black) is used with the
      key-block. It should be steeped in water for five or six months,
      then thoroughly well mixed in a wooden dish with a wooden mixer.
      _Tsuya-Zumi_ is the brilliant black used for such details as human
      hair, black lacquer objects, &c. It is obtained by the use of a
      _Dosa_ medium (mixture of glue and alum); and printed from a
      separate block.
      SILVER COLOR _(Gin-ro)._ Lead powder mixed with glue.
      GOLD COLOR _(Kin-iro)._ Brass powder mixed with glue.
      COPPER COLOR _(Akegane-iro)._ Pure copper powder mixed with glue.
      WHITE _(Shiro)._ Powered white clay _(JoIfun)_ mixed with glue.
      Clamshell powder _(Namaguriko)_ is sometimes employed.
_      Bengara_ (IRON RED), _Tan_ (RED LEAD) and MICA are also used.

NOTE.--The above colours are those given in the _Bungei Riusan_ (see p.
22).

Great importance was attached to the grinding and mixing of the colours.
The glue-water medium used for mixing with black was made in the
proportion of about one-third of an ounce of glue to three-fourths of a
pint of water; but these proportions varied with various qualities of the
pigment or paper. In the case of other colours, glue was not always used,
but rice-paste (made with rice-flour and boiling water); the actual being
sometimes done in the process of applying the colour to the block. A
little alum was dissolved in the cold water with which the rice-paste was
mixed. A specially brilliant effect was produced by laying a light wash of
rice-paste over the block before spreading the colours.

RELIEF PRINTING.--For this purpose, a special block is made for that part
in the print where the relief is required. The print is laid _back
downwards_ on the block, in the opposite manner to that used when printing
colour, and the impression is rubbed in with a tool of ivory--the canine
teeth of the wild boar being the material most favoured.

PAPER


Japanese paper, of the kinds used for artistic purposes, is made from the
inner bark of various plants, chiefly the _Broussonetia Papyrifera,
Edgeworthia Papyrifera_ and _Wickstroemia Canescens._ The young shoots of
the plant are cut in the withy stage; the fibre freed from the wood, and
the skin and green parts of the bark, and edges of knot-holes and other
defective parts are cut out. The selected residuum is then laid in running
water for several days, and boiled in an iron kettle with lye, till it is
quite soft and pulpy. The pulp is next washed with fresh water until the
water runs off without discolouration. The process of dealing with this
pulp does not greatly differ in principle from the European method; except
that the scoop-net is not of wire, but of fine parallel bamboo splints or
silk net toughened with Shibu (a preparation containing a large proportion
of tannic acid). There is no watermark in Japanese paper; but patterns are
sometimes produced by arrangements of bamboo splints woven, in net
fashion, with silk or hemp thread _(Mon-shi--_patterned paper). The
Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design possesses a collection of
specimens of various Japanese papers.

The fine quality of the colours in old Japanese colour-prints is due, to a
considerable extent, to the nature of the paper and especially to its
tough but highly absorbent character.

1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY -- You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution
of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs
and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
