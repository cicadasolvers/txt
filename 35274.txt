   Transcriber's Note

   Led by the belief that the spelling and punctuation of each
   entry is based directly on the original title pages no
   intentional 'corrections' have been made to the content. The
   text in this e-book is as close to the original printed text
   as pgdp proofing and postprocessing could get it. In some
   entries larger spaces are used as spacers between
   bibliographic fields instead of punctuation. These have been
   retained to the best of our ability and are represented as
   non-breaking spaces.

First edition. Vignette portrait on the title-page, by S. Ravenet after

The arrangement of preliminary leaves in this volume is so unusual as to
give the impression on a first examination that c1 is missing. But as
the copy in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, is similar to this,
except for the transposition of the half-title of "The Regicide," which
there precedes the Preface instead of the play itself, as in the present
copy, the supposition is that no leaves are lacking.

As the present copy is in the original boards, the arrangement of
signatures is easily discernible. For the preliminary leaves it is as
follows: Half-title and title, one unnumbered sheet; a, eight leaves; b,
eight leaves; c, six leaves, the first four lettered c2, c3, c4, and 2
(according to the actual folding of the sheet, there is no c1, the first
page being misprinted c2); two leaves, with no signatures, pasted
together, viz.: the end of the Preface (verso "Persons of the Drama")
and the half-title of "The Regicide" (verso blank); B, six leaves, the
first three lettered B2, B3, and B4; one leaf pasted to B and numbered
4. Signatures C-S are in eights.

The pagination of the preliminary leaves is as follows: Half-title and
title unnumbered, i-xxix (viii misprinted iii), four unnumbered pages,
and xxxvi-xlvii, the verso of which is unnumbered. The omitted numbers
between xxix and xxxvi indicate a missing leaf, but even though the
half-title of "The Regicide" were to fill the place, as in the copy in
the Advocates' Library, making the Preface to the whole book follow the
half-title of one of the works, which is an unnatural arrangement, there
would still be a missing leaf, as the first page of text of "The
Regicide" is numbered 3.

The simplest explanation of the discrepancy is to suppose a printer's
error in the pagination of the preliminary matter; i.e., xxxvi should be
xxxiv.

There is no copy of this edition in the British Museum or the Bodleian
Library, nor in the University or Trinity College Libraries, Cambridge,
and the copy in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, bound in full calf,
lacks the preliminary half-title.

With this record of signatures, the following collation gives the
lettering of the leaves as actually printed.

Collation: Half-title, one leaf (verso blank). Title with portrait, one
leaf (verso blank). Life, a1-a8 and b1-b7 (verso blank). Contents, b8.
Preface, c2-c8 (verso "Persons of the Drama"). Half-title of "The
Regicide," one leaf, which might be counted as c8, to complete the
signature c, or as B1, to precede B2. "The Regicide," B2-I5, in eights.
Half-title of "The Reprisal," I6 (verso "Persons represented").
Prologue, I7. Text, I8-O5 (verso blank), ending with the Epilogue.
Half-title, "Advice, and Reproof: two Satires. First published in the
Year 1746 and 1747," O6 (verso blank). "Advice," O7-P6. Half-title of
"Reproof," P7 (verso blank). Text, P8-Q6. "The Tears of Scotland," 1746,

Although "Vanessa" [Hester Vanhomrigh] died in 1723, the present poem

second by W. Blandford, practically a reprint of the first; the third by
J. Roberts, which contains some variations from the others, notably the
addition on page 35 of the ten lines beginning "But what Success
Vanessa met."

An uncut copy of one of four editions published in 1726. Presumably the
first edition, with the misprints "subsidues," instead of "subsidies,"
Part I, page 35, line 5, and "_ebe_ Houyhnhmns" in the running headline,
Part IV, page 165.

SWIFT, JONATHAN.--(I.) Travels into several Remote Nations of the World.
In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain
of several Ships. Vol. I. London: Printed for Benj. Motte, at the
Middle Temple-Gate in Fleet-street. M DCC XX VI. (II.) Travels into
several Remote Nations of the World. By Captain Lemuel Gulliver. Part
III. A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Glubbdubdrib, Luggnagg and Japan.
Part IV. A Voyage to the Houyhnhnms. London: Printed for Benjamin Motte,
at the Middle-Temple-Gate. M DCC XXVI. _8vo, four parts in two volumes,
green levant morocco, gilt back, side borders in floral and bird
design, doubled with red morocco, floral border, red figured silk
guards, gilt edges, by The Club Bindery._

Presumably the second edition. One of the three large paper copies on
record, a second being in the British Museum. This one measures 9 by
5-3/8 inches, and besides the six maps, has a portrait of Gulliver
without the inscription around the oval. Instead of two lines in Latin
beneath, the legend is "Captain Lemuel Gulliver, of Redriff AEtat. suae
58."

The two title-pages of Volume I appear to be the same as in the
preceding edition, but in Volume II "Glubbdubdrib" has one final "b"
instead of two, and "Vol. II." is omitted. The type of "World" is
heavier faced in this edition. The text is reset; ornaments, use of
type, and spelling are different. In the Contents of Volume II,
"Pirates" in Chapter I is here spelled "Pyrates." Page 74 of Part III is
misprinted 44 in this edition, and not in the preceding; but the
misprint in the running headline on page 165, Part IV, is here corrected
to "_the_ Houyhnhmns." "Glubbdubdrib" is spelled without the final "b"
in the text of both editions, except at the head of Chapter I, in the
preceding, which would point to the final "bb" on the title of Volume II
as a misprint corrected in the present edition.

In both editions Chapter VII of Part III is misprinted Chapter V. Part
III of the present edition contains 155 pages, whereas the previous
edition contains 154 and ends with a different signature.

Collation: I. Title, A1 (verso blank). Contents, A2 (verso blank). "The
Publisher to the Reader," signed Richard Sympson, A3-A5 (verso blank).
Title of Part I, 1726, with the same floral ornament as in the preceding
edition, A6 (verso blank). Contents, A7-A8. Pages i-xvi. Text of Part I,
B1-L2, in eights. Pages 1-148.

Part II: The same as the preceding edition.

II. Title, A1 (verso blank). Contents, A2-A3. Plate III, A4 (recto
blank). Text, B1-K8, in eights, L1-L4, and M1-M2 (verso blank). Pages
1-155, 74 misprinted 44.

Part IV: The same as the preceding edition, without the final Key.


SWIFT, JONATHAN.--Travels into several Remote Nations of the World.
1726. _8vo, four parts in two volumes, Spanish calf, gilt back, gilt

Another copy, on small paper, with portrait having the inscription
around the oval, and six maps.

Collation: The same as the preceding copy.

in two volumes, red levant morocco, gilt back, doubled with green
morocco, gilt borders in the manner of Derome, green moire silk guards,
gilt edges, by A. Meyer._

Presumably the fourth edition. The pagination of the two parts in each
volume is continuous, and Plates II and VI, preceding Parts II and IV,
respectively, are both numbered Page I, as though made for the previous
editions, in which those parts have a separate pagination.

The title of Volume II follows line for line that of the edition No. I
preceding, with "Glubbdubdribb" spelled with two final "b's," but the
entire work is reset. As in the other two editions, Chapter VII of Part
III is misprinted V.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
