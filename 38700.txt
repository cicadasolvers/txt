EXPLANATIONS TO THE STUDENT.

THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE WORDS.--Every word is given in its _alphabetical_
order, except in cases where, to save space, derivatives are given after
and under the words from which they are derived. Each uncompounded verb has
its participles, when irregular, placed after it. Exceptional plurals are
also given. When a word stands after another, with no meaning given, its
meanings can be at once formed from those of the latter, by adding the
signification of the affix: thus the meanings of _Darkness_ are obtained by
prefixing the meaning of _ness_, _state of being_, to those of _Dark_.

Many words from French and other tongues, current in English usage, but not
yet fairly Anglicised, are inserted in the list of Foreign Phrases, &c., at
the end, rather than in the body of the Dictionary.

THE PRONUNCIATION.--The Pronunciation is given immediately after each word,
by the word being spelled anew. In this new spelling, every consonant used
has its ordinary unvarying sound, _no consonant being employed that has
more than one sound_. The same sounds are always represented by the same
letters, no matter how varied their actual spelling in the language. No
consonant used has any mark attached to it, with the one exception of _th_,
which is printed in common letters when sounded as in _thick_, but in
italics when sounded as in _th_en. _Unmarked vowels_ have always their
short sounds, as in _lad_, _led_, _lid_, _lot_, _but_, _book_. The _marked
vowels_ are shown in the following line, which is printed at the top of
each page:--

f[=a]te, f[:a]r; m[=e], h[.e]r; m[=i]ne; m[=o]te; m[=u]te; m[=oo]n; _th_en.

The vowel _u_ when marked thus, _[:u]_, has the sound heard in Scotch
_bluid_, _gude_, the French _du_, almost that of the German _[:u]_ in
_M[:u]ller_. Where more than one pronunciation of a word is given, that
which is placed first is more accepted.

THE SPELLING.--When more than one form of a word is given, that which is
placed first is the spelling in current English use. Unfortunately our
modern spelling does not represent the English we actually speak, but
rather the language of the 16th century, up to which period, generally
speaking, English spelling was mainly phonetic, like the present German.
The fundamental principle of all rational spelling is no doubt the
representation of every sound by an invariable symbol, but in modern
English the usage of pronunciation has drifted far from the conventional
forms established by a traditional orthography, with the result that the
present spelling of our written speech is to a large extent a mere exercise
of memory, full of confusing anomalies and imperfections, and involving an
enormous and unnecessary strain on the faculties of learners. Spelling
reform is indeed an imperative necessity, but it must proceed with a wise
moderation, for, in the words of Mr Sweet, 'nothing can be done without
unanimity, and until the majority of the community are convinced of the
superiority of some one system unanimity is impossible.' The true path of
progress should follow such wisely moderate counsels as those of Dr J. A.
H. Murray:--the dropping of the final or inflexional silent _e_; the
restoration of the historical _-t_ after breath consonants; uniformity in
the employment of double consonants, as in _traveler_, &c.; the discarding
of _ue_ in words like _demagogue_ and _catalogue_; the uniform levelling of
the agent _-our_ into _-or_; the making of _ea = [)e]_ short into _e_ and
the long _ie_ into _ee_; the restoration of _some_, _come_, _tongue_, to
their old English forms, _sum_, _cum_, _tung_; a more extended use of _z_
in the body of words, as _chozen_, _praize_, _raize_; and the correction of
the worst individual monstrosities, as _foreign_, _scent_, _scythe_,
_ache_, _debt_, _people_, _parliament_, _court_, _would_, _sceptic_,
_phthisis_, _queue_, _schedule_, _twopence-halfpenny_, _yeoman_, _sieve_,
_gauge_, _barque_, _buoy_, _yacht_, &c.

Already in America a moderate degree of spelling reform may be said to be
established in good usage, by the adoption of _-or_ for _-our_, as _color_,
_labor_, &c.; of _-er_ for _-re_, as _center_, _meter_, &c.; _-ize_ for
_-ise_, as _civilize_, &c.; the use of a uniform single consonant after an
unaccented vowel, as _traveler_ for _traveller_; the adoption of _e_ for
_oe_ or _ae_ in _hemorrhage_, _diarrhea_, &c.

THE MEANINGS.--The current and most important meaning of a word is usually
given first. But in cases like _Clerk_, _Livery_, _Marshal_, where the
force of the word can be made much clearer by tracing its history, the
original meaning is also given, and the successive variations of its usage
defined.

THE ETYMOLOGY.--The Etymology of each word is given after the meanings,
within brackets. Where further information regarding a word is given
elsewhere, it is so indicated by a reference. It must be noted under the
etymology that whenever a word is printed thus, BAN, BASE, the student is
referred to it; also that here the sign--is always to be read as meaning
'derived from.' Examples are generally given of words that are cognate or
correspond to the English words; but it must be remembered that they are
inserted merely for illustration. Such words are usually separated from the
rest by a semicolon. For instance, when an English word is traced to its
Anglo-Saxon form, and then a German word is given, no one should suppose
that our English word is derived from the German. German and Anglo-Saxon
are alike branches from a common Teutonic stem, and have seldom borrowed
from each other. Under each word the force of the prefix is usually given,
though not the affix. For fuller explanation in such cases the student is
referred to the list of Prefixes and Suffixes in the Appendix.

Portuguese, and even Italian, as in accol_ade_, gascon_ade_. Also we have
ambass_ade_, ambusc_ade_, balustr_ade_, brig_ade_, casc_ade_, &c. from
French, words in _-ade_. Examples of words formed in imitation of these in
English itself are block_ade_, orange_ade_.

as approv_al_, deni_al_, remov_al_, betroth_al_. Latin nouns in _-alia_

adopted in Middle English as _-aylle_, _-aille_, later _-aile_, _-al_, as
Latin spons_[=a]lia_, O. Fr. espous_ailles_, M. E. spous_aille_, spous_al_;
L. batt_[=a]lia_, O. Fr. bat_aille_, M. E. bat_aille_, bat_ail_, battle. On
this analogy, _-aille_, _-ail_, _-al_, became a formative of nouns of
action on verbs of French or Latin, and even of Teutonic, origin. [L.

'elegantness,' as distinct from the sense of action or process, regularly
expressed by the French form _-ance_, as in aid_ance_, guid_ance_. The
modern tendency is to confine _-nce_ to action, and to express quality or
state by _-ncy_; cf. compli_ance_, pli_ancy_, annoy_ance_, buoy_ancy_.

SYMBOLS USED IN MEDICINE AND PHARMACY.

[scruple] Scruple; [scruple]i, one scruple; [scruple]ij, two scruples;
[scruple]ss, half a scruple; [scruple]iss, a scruple and a half.

[drachm] Dram or drachm; [drachm]i, one dram; [drachm]ij, two drams;
[drachm]ss, half a dram; [drachm]iss, a dram and a half.

[ounce] Ounce; [ounce]i, one ounce; [ounce]ij, two ounces; [ounce]ss, half
an ounce; [ounce]iss, an ounce and a half.

[minim] A minim; a drop.

[ana] (Gr. _ana_), of each a like quantity.

The above symbols are employed almost always in medical prescriptions. A
prescription consists of the following parts: (1) The _Superscription_; (2)
The _Inscription_; (3) The _Subscription_; (4) The _Signature_. The
_Superscription_, which consists of the letter [recipe], is a relic of the
days of astrology. It originally was used to represent the symbol of the
planet Jupiter. By common consent it is now regarded as representing the
imperative mood of the Latin verb _recipere_, to take. The _Inscription_ is
a statement of the names of the substances to be used, with their
quantities. The _Subscription_ is made up of the directions for the
guidance of the dispenser. The _Signature_ includes the directions to the
patient. This part of the prescription should be written in English; the
other parts are in Latin. Sometimes the signature also is in Latin.

The body or prescription contains the following: the _Basis_, or principal
active ingredient; the _Adjuvant_, or _Auxiliary_, to assist its action;
the _Corrective_, to correct or diminish some undesirable quality; the
_Vehicle_, or _Excipient_, to give a suitable form for administration.

CORRECT CEREMONIOUS FORMS OF ADDRESS.

    The following are the correct ceremonious modes of addressing and
    beginning letters to persons of title or holding offices:

AMBASSADOR, BRITISH--Address: 'His Excellency [in other respects according
to his rank], H.B.M.'s Ambassador and Plenipotentiary.' Begin: 'Sir,' 'My
Lord,' &c., according to rank. Refer personally to as 'Your Excellency.' An
Ambassador's wife, when resident abroad, is sometimes, but not very
correctly, designated 'Your Excellency.'

ARCHBISHOP--'His Grace the Lord Archbishop of ----.' Begin: 'My Lord
Archbishop.' Refer to as 'Your Grace.' In formal documents the Archbishop
of Canterbury is addressed as 'The Most Reverend Father in God, Frederick,
by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England
and Metropolitan;' the Archbishop of York as 'The Most Reverend Father in
God, William, by Divine permission Lord Archbishop of York, Primate of
England and Metropolitan.' But an Irish Archbishop appointed since 1868 is
only 'The Most Reverend the Archbishop of ----,' unless he happen to be a
temporal peer, in which case he is 'The Right Hon. and Most Rev.'

ARCHDEACON--'The Venerable the Archdeacon of ----.' Begin: 'Venerable Sir.'

BARON--'The Right Hon. Lord ----,' or 'The Lord ----.' Begin: 'My Lord.'
Refer to as 'Your Lordship.'

BARON'S DAUGHTER--If unmarried, 'The Hon.' [Christian name and surname]; if
married, 'The Hon. Mrs' [husband's surname]. Begin: 'Madam.' If married to
a Baronet or Knight, 'The Hon. Lady' [husband's surname]. Begin: 'My Lady.'
If the wife of a peer, or of the son of a Duke or Marquess, address as
such.

BARON'S SON--'The Hon.' [Christian name and surname]. Begin: 'Sir.' But the
eldest sons of Barons in the Peerage of Scotland are usually addressed as
'The Hon. the Master of' [peerage title].

BARON'S SON'S WIFE--'The Hon. Mrs' [husband's surname], or, if necessary
for distinction, the husband's Christian name should also be used. Begin:
'Madam.' If the daughter of an Earl, Marquess, or Duke, address as such.

BARONESS, EITHER IN HER OWN RIGHT OR HER HUSBAND'S--'The Right Hon. the
Baroness ----,' 'The Right Hon. Lady ----,' or 'The Lady ----.' Begin: 'My
Lady.' Refer to as 'Your Ladyship.'

BARONET--'Sir [Christian name and surname], Bart.' Commence: 'Sir.'

BARONET'S WIFE--'Lady' [surname]. Begin: 'Madam.' Refer to as 'Your
Ladyship.'

BISHOP, COLONIAL--As Scottish bishop.

BISHOP, ENGLISH--'The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of London,' or 'The Lord
Bishop of London.' Begin: 'My Lord Bishop.' Refer to as 'Your Lordship.' In
formal documents a Bishop is 'The Right Rev. Father in God, John, by Divine
permission Lord Bishop of Salisbury.'

BISHOP, IRISH, CONSECRATED BEFORE 1868--As English Bishop.

BISHOP, IRISH, CONSECRATED SINCE 1868--'The Right Rev. the Bishop of
Ossory,' or in case of the Bishops of Meath and Tuam, 'The Most Rev.'
Begin: 'Right Rev. Sir,' or 'Most Rev. Sir.'

BISHOP, RETIRED--'The Right Rev. Bishop ----,' or 'The Right Rev. ----
----, D.D.' Begin: 'Right Rev. Sir.'

BISHOP, SCOTTISH--'The Right Rev. the Bishop of Edinburgh,' or 'The Right
Rev. Bishop Dowden.' The Bishop who holds the position of Primus is
generally addressed, 'The Most Rev. the Primus.' The use of 'Lord Bishop'
and 'My Lord' is incorrect.

BISHOP SUFFRAGAN--'The Right Rev. the Bishop Suffragan of Bedford.' Begin:
'Right Rev. Sir.'

BISHOPS' WIVES AND CHILDREN have no titles.

CLERGY--'The Rev.' [Christian name and surname]. Begin: 'Rev. Sir.' If son
of a Duke or Marquess, 'The Rev. Lord' [Christian name and surname]. If the
son of an Earl, Viscount, or Baron, 'The Rev. the Hon.' [Christian name and
surname] is beginning to supersede 'The Hon. and Rev.' The Moderator of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland during his year of office is
styled 'Right Rev.;' ex-moderators are usually spoken of as 'Very Rev.'

COMPANION OF AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD--The initials, C.B., C.M.G., C.S.I., or
C.I.E., as it may be, are subjoined to the ordinary form of address.

CONSUL, BRITISH--'---- ----, Esq., H.B.M.'s Agent and Consul-General,'
'Consul-General,' 'Consul,' or 'Vice-Consul,' as it may be.

COUNTESS--'The Right Hon. the Countess of ----.' Begin: 'Madam.' Refer to
as 'Your Ladyship.'

DEAN--'The Very Rev. the Dean of ----.' Begin: 'Very Rev. Sir.'

DOCTOR--The initials D.D., M.D., LL.D., Mus.D., are placed after the
ordinary form of address, as 'The Rev. John Davidson, D.D.,' 'David
Patrick, Esq., LL.D.' But 'The Rev. Dr Davidson,' 'Dr David Patrick,' are
also frequently used.

DOWAGER--On the marriage of a peer or Baronet, the widow of the previous
holder of the title becomes 'Dowager,' and is addressed, 'The Right Hon.
the Dowager Countess of ----,' 'The Dowager Lady ----.' As more than one
Dowager may hold the same title, the term is less used than formerly, and
the Christian name is instead coming to be employed as a distinction--e.g.
'The Right Hon. Helen Countess of ----.'

DUCHESS--'Her Grace the Duchess of ----.' Begin: 'Madam.' Refer to as 'Your
Grace.'

DUKE--'His Grace the Duke of ----.' Begin: 'My Lord Duke.' Refer to as
'Your Grace.'

DUKE'S DAUGHTER--'The Right Hon. Lady' [Christian name and surname], or
'The Lady' [Christian name and surname], the surname being that of her
husband if married. Begin: 'Madam.' Refer to as 'Your Ladyship.' If married
to a peer, she is addressed according to her husband's rank only. This,
however, does not hold in the case of peers by courtesy; and a Duke's
daughter married to the eldest son of an Earl, after the prefix 'Lady,'
sometimes takes her own Christian name, followed by her husband's courtesy
title.

DUKE'S ELDEST SON AND HIS CHILDREN--The courtesy title is treated as if it
were an actual peerage; his eldest son taking the grandfather's third
title, and being addressed as if a peer.

DUKE'S ELDEST SON'S WIFE--As if her husband's courtesy title were an actual
peerage.

DUKE'S YOUNGER SON--'The Right Hon. Lord' [Christian name and surname], or
'The Lord' [Christian name and surname]. Begin: 'My Lord.' Refer to as
'Your Lordship.'

DUKE'S YOUNGER SON'S WIFE--'The Right Hon. Lady,' or 'The Lady' [husband's
Christian name and surname]. Begin: 'Madam.' Refer to as 'Your Ladyship.'

EARL--'The Right Hon. the Earl of ----,' or 'The Earl of ----.' Begin: 'My
Lord.' Refer to as 'Your Lordship.'

EARL'S DAUGHTER--As Duke's daughter.

EARL'S ELDEST SON, and EARL'S ELDEST SON'S WIFE--As if the courtesy title
were an actual peerage.

EARL'S YOUNGER SON AND HIS WIFE--As Baron's son and his wife.

GOVERNOR OF COLONY--'His Excellency [ordinary designation], Governor of
----.' Begin according to rank, and refer to as 'Your Excellency.'

JUDGE, ENGLISH OR IRISH--'The Hon. Sir ---- ----,' if a Knight, or 'The
Hon. Mr Justice ----.' Begin: 'Sir.' On the bench only he is addressed as
'My Lord,' and referred to as 'Your Lordship.'

JUDGE OF COUNTY COURT--'His Honour Judge ----.' When on the bench, referred
to as 'Your Honour.'

JUDGES, SCOTTISH--See Lord of Session.

JUSTICE OF PEACE IN ENGLAND (not Scotland)--'The Right Worshipful.'
Referred to when on the bench as 'Your Worship.'

KING--'The King's Most Excellent Majesty.' Begin: 'Sire,' or 'May it please
your Majesty,' or 'Lord ---- presents his duty to your Majesty.' Refer to
as 'Your Majesty.'

KNIGHT BACHELOR--As Baronet, except that the word 'Bart.' is omitted.

KNIGHT OF THE BATH, OF ST MICHAEL AND ST GEORGE, OR OF THE STAR OF

K.C.B., K.M.G., or K.S.I. added. Begin: 'Sir.'

KNIGHT OF THE GARTER, OF THE THISTLE, OR OF ST PATRICK--The initials K.G.,
K.T., or K.P., as it may be, are to be added to the address.

KNIGHT'S WIFE, WHETHER WIFE OF KNIGHT BACHELOR, OF THE BATH, OF ST MICHAEL
AND ST GEORGE, OR OF THE STAR OF INDIA--As Baronet's wife.

LORD ADVOCATE OF SCOTLAND--'The Right Hon. the Lord Advocate.' Usual

Commissioner.' Begin according to rank as a peer. Refer to as 'Your Grace.'

LORD JUSTICE-CLERK--'The Right Hon. the Lord Justice-Clerk.' Begin: 'My
Lord.' Refer to as 'Your Lordship.'

Justice-General.' Begin: 'My Lord.' Refer to as 'Your Lordship.'

rank--e.g. 'Admiral the Right Hon. the Earl of ----,' 'Lieut.-Col. Sir ----
----, K.C.B.' Officers below the rank of Captain in the Army or Commander
in the Navy are more generally addressed by their social, not professional
rank, followed by the name of the regiment, R.A., R.E., or R.N., as may be.

PREMIER--According to his rank.

In correspondence with equals or personal friends letters are begun less
formally--e.g., 'My dear Lord,' 'Dear Lord ----,' 'Dear Sir James.' We are
less ceremonious than our ancestors a few generations ago, when letters to
the nearest relatives and most intimate friends were begun and ended in the
most formal manner. Designations like 'Mrs General ----,' 'Mrs Captain
----,' 'Mrs Dr ----,' which were fifty years ago not uncommon, were always
improper. Persons holding offices other than those enumerated are addressed
in the usual form, 'Sir,' 'Dear Sir,' or 'My dear Sir,' according to the
more or less formal terms on which the writer may be with his
correspondent. A firm is addressed 'Gentlemen' or 'Dear Sirs.'

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
