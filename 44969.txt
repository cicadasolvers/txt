Transcriber's Notes

This book contains material in multiple languages, and numerous examples
of archaic, non-standard and dialect forms of English. Therefore no
attempts to standardize spelling would be appropriate. The only changes
to the text are to resolve typographical errors etc. which are listed at
the end of the book. Minor corrections to format or punctuation have
been made without comment.

This Plain Text version of the e-book has been prepared using the ASCII
character set. The following substitutions have been made to represent
other characters and diacritics:

[a'] and ['s] denote editorial insertions of contracted forms, not
special characters: e.g. on page 299 [a'] is an editorial insertion of

(for "has"?).

  _underscore symbols_ represent italic typeface

Bold mark-up is widely used to denote the distinctive font used by the
author for ballad version references.

Some sections of ballads are set in differently sized type and indicated
in the introductions. Usually this is smaller type, but in the case of
ballad 39, larger. These passages are indicated by means of further
indentation and side-lining (|) in the left margin. Ballad 53 versions M
and N are entirely in smaller type, but without explanation.

Footnotes have been numbered from [1] to [427] sequentially throughout
the whole book, but are presented at the end of each ballad or section
to which they refer.

A line of 7 spaced dots indicates a missing line of poetry. A line of 7
spaced asterisks indicates missing poetry material of one or more
stanzas; this is distinct from a "thought break" or sub-section
separator of 5 widely spaced asterisks such as follow these notes.

_MY DEAR FURNIVALL_:

_Without the Percy MS. no one would pretend to make a collection of the
English Ballads, and but for you that manuscript would still, I think,
be beyond reach of man, yet exposed to destructive chances. Through your
exertions and personal sacrifices, directly, the famous and precious
folio has been printed; and, indirectly, in consequence of the same, it
has been transferred to a place where it is safe, and open to
inspection. This is only one of a hundred reasons which I have for
asking you to accept the dedication of this book from_

                      _Your grateful friend and fellow-student_,
                                          _F. J. CHILD._

It was my wish not to begin to print The English and Scottish Popular
Ballads until this unrestricted title should be justified by my having
at command every valuable copy of every known ballad. A continuous
effort to accomplish this object has been making for some nine or ten
years, and many have joined in it. By correspondence, and by an
extensive diffusion of printed circulars, I have tried to stimulate
collection from tradition in Scotland, Canada, and the United States,
and no becoming means has been left unemployed to obtain possession of
unsunned treasures locked up in writing. The gathering from tradition
has been, as ought perhaps to have been foreseen at this late day,
meagre, and generally of indifferent quality. Materials in the hands of
former editors have, in some cases, been lost beyond recovery, and very
probably have lighted fires, like that large cantle of the Percy
manuscript, _maxime deflendus_! Access to several manuscript collections
has not yet been secured. But what is still lacking is believed to bear
no great proportion to what is in hand, and may soon come in, besides:
meanwhile, the uncertainties of the world forbid a longer delay to
publish so much as has been got together.

Of hitherto unused materials, much the most important is a large
collection of ballads made by Motherwell. For leave to take a copy of
this I am deeply indebted to the present possessor, Mr Malcolm Colquhoun
Thomson, of Glasgow, who even allowed the manuscript to be sent to
London, and to be retained several months, for my accommodation. Mr J.
Wylie Guild, of Glasgow, also permitted the use of a note-book of
Motherwell's which supplements the great manuscript, and this my
unwearied friend, Mr James Barclay Murdoch, to whose solicitation I owe
both, himself transcribed with the most scrupulous accuracy. No other
good office, asked or unasked, has Mr Murdoch spared.

Next in extent to the Motherwell collections come those of the late Mr
Kinloch. These he freely placed at my disposal, and Mr William Macmath,
of Edinburgh, made during Mr Kinloch's life an exquisite copy of the
larger part of them, enriched with notes from Mr Kinloch's papers, and
sent it to me across the water. After Mr Kinloch's death his collections
were acquired by Harvard College Library, still through the agency of Mr
Macmath, who has from the beginning rendered a highly valued assistance,
not less by his suggestions and communications than by his zealous
mediation.

No Scottish ballads are superior in kind to those recited in the last
century by Mrs Brown, of Falkland. Of these there are, or were, three
sets. One formerly owned by Robert Jamieson, the fullest of the three,
was lent me, to keep as long as I required, by my honored friend the
late Mr David Laing, who also secured for me copies of several ballads
of Mrs Brown which are found in an Abbotsford manuscript, and gave me a
transcript of the Glenriddell manuscript. The two others were written
down for William Tytler and Alexander Fraser Tytler respectively, the
former of these consisting of a portion of the Jamieson texts revised.
These having for some time been lost sight of, Miss Mary Fraser Tytler,
with a graciousness which I have reason to believe hereditary in the
name, made search for them, recovered the one which had been obtained by
Lord Woodhouselee, and copied it for me with her own hand. The same lady
furnished me with another collection which had been made by a member of
the family.

For later transcriptions from Scottish tradition I am indebted to Mr J.
F. Campbell of Islay, whose edition and rendering of the racy West
Highland Tales is marked by the rarest appreciation of the popular
genius; to Mrs A. F. Murison, formerly of Old Deer, who undertook a
quest for ballads in her native place on my behalf; to Mr Alexander
Laing, of Newburgh-upon-Tay; to Mr James Gibb, of Joppa, who has given
me a full score; to Mr David Louden, of Morham, Haddington; to the late
Dr John Hill Burton and Miss Ella Burton; to Dr Thomas Davidson.

The late Mr Robert White, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, allowed me to look
through his collections in 1873, and subsequently made me a copy of such
things as I needed, and his ready kindness has been continued by Mrs
Andrews, his sister, and by Miss Andrews, his niece, who has taken a
great deal of trouble on my account.

In the south of the mother-island my reliance has, of necessity, been
chiefly upon libraries. The British Museum possesses, besides early
copies of some of the older ballads, the Percy MS., Herd's MSS and
Buchan's, and the Roxburgh broadsides. The library of the University of
Cambridge affords one or two things of first-rate importance, and for
these I am beholden to the accomplished librarian, Mr Henry Bradshaw,
and to Professor Skeat. I have also to thank the Rev. F. Gunton, Dean,
and the other authorities of Magdalen College, Cambridge, for permitting
collations of Pepys ballads, most obligingly made for me by Mr Arthur S.
B. Miller. Many things were required from the Bodleian library, and
these were looked out for me, and scrupulously copied or collated, by Mr
George Parker.

Texts of traditional ballads have been communicated to me in America by
Mr W. W. Newell, of New York, who is soon to give us an interesting
collection of Children's Games traditional in America; by Dr Huntington,
Bishop of Central New York; Mr G. C. Mahon, of Ann Arbor, Michigan; Miss
Margaret Reburn, of New Albion, Iowa; Miss Perine, of Baltimore; Mrs
Augustus Lowell, Mrs L. F. Wesselhoeft, Mrs. Edward Atkinson, of Boston;
Mrs Cushing, of Cambridge; Miss Ellen Marston, of New Bedford; Mrs
Moncrieff, of London, Ontario.

Acknowledgments not well despatched in a phrase are due to many others
who have promoted my objects: to Mr Furnivall, for doing for me
everything which I could have done for myself had I lived in England; to
that master of old songs and music, Mr William Chappell, very specially;
to Mr J. Payne Collier; Mr Norval Clyne, of Aberdeen; Mr Alexander
Young, of Glasgow; Mr Arthur Laurenson, of Lerwick, Shetland; Mr J.
Burrell Curtis, of Edinburgh; Dr Vigfusson, of Oxford; Professor Edward
Arber, of Birmingham; the Rev. J. Percival, Mr Francis Fry, Mr J. F.
Nicholls, of Bristol; Professor George Stephens, of Copenhagen; Mr R.
Bergstr[:o]m, of the Royal Library, Stockholm; Mr W. R. S. Ralston, Mr
William Henry Husk, Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith, Mr A. F. Murison, of
London; Professor Sophocles; Mr W. G. Medlicott, of Longmeadow; to Mr M.
Heilprin, of New York, Mme de Maltchyc['e], of Boston, and Rabbi Dr Cohn,
for indispensable translations from Polish and Hungarian; to Mr James
Russell Lowell, Minister of the United States at London; to Professor
Charles Eliot Norton, for such "pains and benefits" as I could ask only
of a life-long friend.

In the editing of these ballads I have closely followed the plan of
Grundtvig's Old Popular Ballads of Denmark, a work which will be prized
highest by those who have used it most, and which leaves nothing to be
desired but its completion. The author is as much at home in English as
in Danish tradition, and whenever he takes up a ballad which is common
to both nations nothing remains to be done but to supply what has come
to light since the time of his writing. But besides the assistance which
I have derived from his book, I have enjoyed the advantage of Professor
Grundtvig's criticism and advice, and have received from him unprinted
Danish texts, and other aid in many ways.

Such further explanations as to the plan and conduct of the work as may
be desirable can be more conveniently given by and by. I may say here
that textual points which may seem to be neglected will be considered in
an intended Glossary, with which will be given a full account of
Sources, and such indexes of Titles and Matters as will make it easy to
find everything that the book may contain.

With renewed thanks to all helpers, and helpers' helpers, I would
invoke the largest co[:o]peration for the correction of errors and
the supplying of deficiencies. To forestall a misunderstanding which
has often occurred, I beg to say that every traditional version of a
popular ballad is desired, no matter how many texts of the same may
have been printed already.

I have again to express my obligations and my gratitude to many who have
aided in the collecting and editing of these Ballads.

To Sir Hugh Hume Campbell, for the use of two considerable manuscript
volumes of Scottish Ballads.

To Mr Allardyce, of Edinburgh, for a copy of the Skene Ballads, and for
a generous permission to print such as I required, in advance of a
possible publication on his part.

To Mr Mansfield, of Edinburgh, for the use of the Pitcairn manuscripts.

To Mrs Robertson, for the use of Note-Books of the late Dr Joseph
Robertson, and to Mr Murdoch, of Glasgow, Mr Lugton, of Kelso, Mrs
Alexander Forbes, of Edinburgh, and Messrs G. L. Kittredge and G. M.
Richardson, former students of Harvard College, for various
communications.

To Dr Reinhold K[:o]hler's unrivalled knowledge of popular fiction, and
his equal liberality, I am indebted for valuable notes, which will be
found in the Additions at the end of this volume.

The help of my friend Dr Theodor Vetter has enabled me to explore
portions of the Slavic ballad-field which otherwise must have been
neglected.

Professors D. Silvan Evans, John Rhys, Paul Meyer, and T. Frederick
Crane have lent me a ready assistance in literary emergencies.

The interest and co[:o]peration of Mr Furnivall and Mr Macmath have been
continued to me without stint or weariness.

It is impossible, while recalling and acknowledging acts of courtesy,
good will, and friendship, not to allude, with one word of deep personal
grief, to the irreparable loss which all who are concerned with the
study of popular tradition have experienced in the death of Svend
Grundtvig.

FRANCIS JAMES CHILD


Francis James Child was born in Boston on the first day of February,
1825. He was the third in a family of eight children. His father was a
sailmaker, "one of that class of intelligent and independent mechanics,"
writes Professor Norton, "which has had a large share in determining the
character of our democratic community, as of old the same class had in
Athens and in Florence." The boy attended the public schools, as a
matter of course; and, his parents having no thought of sending him to
college, he went, in due time, not to the Latin School, but to the
English High School of his native town. At that time the head master of
the Boston Latin School was Mr Epes Sargent Dixwell, who is still
living, at a ripe old age, one of the most respected citizens of
Cambridge. Mr Dixwell had a keen eye for scholarly possibilities in
boys, and, falling in with young Francis Child, was immediately struck
with his extraordinary mental ability. At his suggestion, the boy was
transferred to the Latin School, where he entered upon the regular
preparation for admission to Harvard College. His delight in his new
studies was unbounded, and the freshness of it never faded from his
memory. "He speedily caught up with the boys who had already made
considerable progress in Greek and Latin, and soon took the first place
here, as he had done in the schools which he had previously attended."
Mr Dixwell strongly advised his father to permit him to continue his
studies, and made arrangements by which his college expenses should be
provided for. The money Professor Child repaid, with interest, as soon
as his means allowed. His gratitude to Mr. Dixwell and the friendship
between them lasted through his life.

In 1842 Mr Child entered Harvard College. The intellectual condition of
the college at that time and the undergraduate career of Mr Child have
been admirably described by his classmate and lifelong friend, Professor
Norton, in a passage which must be quoted in full[1]:--

"Harvard was then still a comparatively small institution, with no
claims to the title of University; but she had her traditions of good
learning as an inspiration for the studious youth, and still better she
had teachers who were examples of devotion to intellectual pursuits, and
who cared for those ends the attainment of which makes life worth
living. Josiah Quincy was approaching the close of his term of service
as President of the College, and stood before the eyes of the students
as the type of a great public servant, embodying the spirit of
patriotism, of integrity, and of fidelity in the discharge of whatever
duty he might be called to perform. Among the Professors were Walker,
Felton, Peirce, Channing, Beck, and Longfellow, men of utmost variety of
temperament, but each an instructor who secured the respect no less than
the gratitude of his pupils.

"The class to which Child belonged numbered hardly over sixty. The
prescribed course of study which was then the rule brought all the
members of the class together in recitations and lectures, and every man
soon knew the relative standing of each of his fellows. Child at once
took the lead and kept it. His excellence was not confined to any one
special branch of study; he was equally superior in all. He was the best
in the classics, he was Peirce's favorite in mathematics, he wrote
better English than any of his classmates. His intellectual interests
were wider than theirs, he was a great reader, and his tastes in reading
were mature. He read for amusement as well as for learning, but he did
not waste his time or dissipate his mental energies over worthless or
pernicious books. He made good use of the social no less than of the
intellectual opportunities which college life affords, and became as
great a favorite with his classmates as he had been with his
schoolfellows.

"The close of his college course was marked by the exceptional
distinction of his being chosen by his classmates as their Orator, and
by his having the first part at Commencement as the highest scholar in
the class. His class oration was remarkable for its maturity of thought
and of style. Its manliness of spirit, its simple directness of
presentation of the true objects of life, and of the motives by which
the educated man, whatever might be his chosen career, should be
inspired, together with the serious and eloquent earnestness with which
it was delivered, gave to his discourse peculiar impressiveness and
effect."

Graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1846, Mr Child
immediately entered the service of the college, in which he continued
till the day of his death. From 1846 to 1848 he was tutor in
mathematics. In 1848 he was transferred, at his own request, to a
tutorship in history and political economy, to which were annexed
certain duties of instruction in English. In 1849 he obtained leave of
absence for travel and study in Europe. He remained in Europe for about
two years, returning, late in 1851, to receive an appointment to the
Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory, then falling vacant by
the resignation of Professor Edward T. Channing.

The tutorships which Mr Child had held were not entirely in accordance
with his tastes, which had always led him in the direction of literary
and linguistic study. The faculty of the college was small, however, and
it was not always possible to assign an instructor to the department
that would have been most to his mind. But the governors of the
institution were glad to secure the services of so promising a scholar;
and Mr Child, whose preference for an academic career was decided, had
felt that it was wise to accept such positions as the college could
offer, leaving exacter adjustments to time and circumstances. Meantime
he had devoted his whole leisure to the pursuit of his favorite studies.
His first fruits were a volume entitled Four Old Plays[2] published in
1848, when he was but twenty-three years old. This was a remarkably
competent performance. The texts are edited with judgment and accuracy;
the introduction shows literary discrimination as well as sound
scholarship, and the glossary and brief notes are thoroughly good. There
are no signs of immaturity in the book, and it is still valued by
students of our early drama.

The leave of absence granted to Mr Child in 1849 came at a most
favorable moment. His health had suffered from close application to
work, and a change of climate had been advised by his physicians. His
intellectual and scholarly development, too, had reached that stage in
which foreign study and travel were certain to be most stimulating and
fruitful. He was amazingly apt, and two years of opportunity meant much
more to him than to most men. He returned to take up the duties of his
new office a trained and mature scholar, at home in the best methods and
traditions of German universities, yet with no sacrifice of his
individuality and intellectual independence.

While in Germany Mr Child studied at Berlin and G[:o]ttingen, giving his
time mostly to Germanic philology, then cultivated with extraordinary
vigor and success. The hour was singularly propitious. In the three or
four decades preceding Mr Child's residence in Europe, Germanic
philology (in the wider sense) had passed from the stage of "romantic"
dilettantism into the condition of a well-organized and strenuous
scientific discipline, but the freshness and vivacity of the first half
of the century had not vanished. Scholars, however severe, looked
through the form and strove to comprehend the spirit. The ideals of
erudition and of a large humanity were not even suspected of
incompatibility. The imagination was still invoked as the guide and
illuminator of learning. The bond between antiquity and medi[ae]valism and
between the Middle Ages and our own century was never lost from sight.
It was certainly fortunate for American scholarship that at precisely
this juncture a young man of Mr Child's ardent love of learning, strong
individuality, and broad intellectual sympathies was brought into close
contact with all that was most quickening in German university life. He
attended lectures on classical antiquity and philosophy, as well as on
Germanic philology; but it was not so much by direct instruction that he
profited as by the inspiration which he derived from the spirit and the
ideals of foreign scholars, young and old. His own greatest contribution
to learning, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, may even, in a
very real sense, be regarded as the fruit of these years in Germany.
Throughout his life he kept a picture of William and James Grimm on the
mantel over his study fireplace.

Mr Child wrote no "dissertation," and returned to Cambridge without
having attempted to secure a doctor's degree. Never eager for such
distinctions, he had been unwilling to subject himself to the
restrictions on his plan of study which candidacy for the doctorate
would have imposed. Three years after, however, in 1854, he was
surprised and gratified to receive from the University of G[:o]ttingen
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, accompanied by a special tribute of
respect from that institution. Subsequently he received the degree of
LL. D. from Harvard (in 1884) and that of L. H. D. from Columbia (in
1887); but the G[:o]ttingen Ph. D., coming as it did at the outset of his
career, was in a high degree auspicious.

The Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory, to which, as has
been already mentioned, Mr Child succeeded on his return to America
toward the end of 1851, was no sinecure. In addition to academic
instruction of the ordinary kind, the duties of the chair included the
superintendence and criticism of a great quantity of written work, in
the nature of essays and set compositions prepared by students of all
degrees of ability. For twenty-five years Mr Child performed these
duties with characteristic punctuality and devotion, though with
increasing distaste for the drudgery which they involved. Meantime a
great change had come over Harvard: it had developed from a provincial
college into a national seminary of learning, and the introduction of
the "elective system"--corresponding to the "Lernfreiheit" of
Germany--had enabled it to become a university in the proper sense of
the word. One result of the important reform just referred to was the
establishment of a Professorship of English, entirely distinct from the
old chair of Rhetoric. This took place on May 8, 1876, and on the 20th
of the next month Mr Child was transferred to the new professorship. His
duties as an instructor were now thoroughly congenial, and he continued
to perform them with unabated vigor to the end. In the onerous details
of administrative and advisory work, inseparable, according to our
exacting American system, from the position of a university professor,
he was equally faithful and untiring. For thirty years he acted as
secretary of the Library Council, and in all that time he was absent
from but three meetings. As chairman of the Department of English and of
the Division of Modern Languages, and as a member of many important
committees, he was ever prodigal of time and effort. How steadily he
attended to the regular duties of the class-room, his pupils, for fifty
years, are the best witnesses. They, too, will best understand the
satisfaction he felt that, in the fiftieth year of his teaching, he was
not absent from a single lecture. No man was ever less a formalist; yet
the most formal of natures could not, in the strictest observance of
punctilio, have surpassed the regularity with which he discharged, as it
were spontaneously, the multifarious duties of his position.

Throughout his service as professor of rhetoric, Mr Child, hampered
though he was by the requirements of his laborious office, had pursued
with unquenchable ardor the study of the English language and
literature, particularly in their older forms, and in these subjects he
had become an authority of the first rank long before the establishment
of the English chair enabled him to arrange his university teaching in
accordance with his tastes. Soon after he returned from Germany he
undertook the general editorial supervision of a series of the 'British
Poets,' published at Boston in 1853 and several following years, and
extending to some hundred and fifty volumes. Out of this grew, in one
way or another, his three most important contributions to learning: his
edition of Spenser, his Observations on the Language of Chaucer and
Gower, and his English and Scottish Popular Ballads.

Mr Child's Spenser appeared in 1855.[3] Originally intended, as he says
in the preface, as little more than a reprint of the edition published
in 1839 under the superintendence of Mr George Hillard, the book grew
upon his hands until it had become something quite different from its
predecessor. Securing access to old copies of most of Spenser's poems,
Mr Child subjected the text to a careful revision, which left little to
be done in this regard. His Life of Spenser was far better than any
previous biography, and his notes, though brief, were marked by a
philological exactness to which former editions could not pretend.
Altogether, though meant for the general reader and therefore sparingly
annotated, Mr Child's volumes remain, after forty years, the best
edition of Spenser in existence.

The plan of the 'British Poets' originally contemplated an edition of
Chaucer, which Mr Child was to prepare. Becoming convinced, however,
that the time was not ripe for such a work, he abandoned this project,
and to the end of his life he never found time to resume it. Thomas
Wright's print of the Canterbury Tales[4] from the Harleian MS. 7334
had, however, put into his hands a reasonably faithful reproduction of
an old text, and he turned his attention to a minute study of Chaucer's
language. The outcome was the publication, in the Memoirs of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences for 1863, of the great treatise to
which Mr Child gave the modest title of Observations on the Language of
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. It is difficult, at the present day, to
imagine the state of Chaucer philology at the moment when this paper
appeared. Scarcely anything, we may say, was known of Chaucer's grammar
and metre in a sure and scientific way. Indeed, the difficulties to be
solved had not even been clearly formulated. Further, the accessible
mass of evidence on Anglo-Saxon and Middle English was, in comparison
with the stores now at the easy command of every tyro, almost
insignificant. Yet, in this brief treatise, Mr Child not only defined
the problems, but provided for most of them a solution which the
researches of younger scholars have only served to substantiate. He also
gave a perfect model of the method proper to such inquiries--a method
simple, laborious, and exact. The Observations were subsequently
rearranged and condensed, with Professor Child's permission, by Mr A. J.
Ellis for his work On Early English Pronunciation; but only those who
have studied them in their original form can appreciate their merit
fully. "It ought never to be forgotten," writes Professor Skeat, "that
the only full and almost complete solution of the question of the right
scansion of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is due to what Mr Ellis rightly
terms 'the wonderful industry, acuteness, and accuracy of Professor
Child.'" Had he produced nothing else, this work, with its pendant, the
Observations on Gower,[5] would have assured him a high place among
those very few scholars who have permanently settled important problems
of linguistic science.

Mr Child's crowning work, however, was the edition of the English and
Scottish Popular Ballads, which the reader now has before him. The
history of this is the history of more than half a lifetime.

The idea of the present work grew out of Mr Child's editorial labors on
the series of the 'British Poets,' already referred to. For this he
prepared a collection in eight small volumes (1857-58) called English
and Scottish Ballads.[6] This was marked by the beginnings of that
method of comparative study which is carried out to its ultimate issues
in the volumes of the present collection. The book circulated widely,
and was at once admitted to supersede all previous attempts in the same
field. To Mr Child, however, it was but the starting-point for further
researches. He soon formed the plan of a much more extensive collection
on an altogether different model. This was to include every obtainable
version of every extant English or Scottish ballad, with the fullest
possible discussion of related songs or stories in the "popular"
literature of all nations. To this enterprise he resolved, if need were,
to devote the rest of his life. His first care was to secure trustworthy
texts. In his earlier collection he had been forced to depend almost
entirely on printed books. No progress, he was convinced, could be made
till recourse could be had to manuscripts, and in particular to the
Percy MS. Accordingly he directed his most earnest efforts to securing
the publication of the entire contents of the famous folio. The Percy
MS. was at Ecton Hall, in the possession of the Bishop's descendants,
who would permit no one even to examine it. Two attempts were made by Dr
Furnivall, at Mr Child's instance, to induce the owners to allow the
manuscript to be printed,--one as early as 1860 or 1861, the other in
1864,--but without avail. A third attempt was more successful, and in
1867-68 the long-secluded folio was made the common property of scholars
in an edition prepared by Professor Hales and Dr Furnivall.[7]

The publication of the Percy MS. not only put a large amount of
trustworthy material at the disposal of Mr Child; it exposed the
full enormity of Bishop Percy's sins against popular tradition. Some
shadow of suspicion inevitably fell on all other ballad collections.
It was more than ever clear to Mr Child that he could not safely
take anything at second hand, and he determined not to print a line
of his projected work till he had exhausted every effort to get
hold of whatever manuscript material might be in existence. His
efforts in this direction continued through many years. A number of
manuscripts were in private hands; of some the whereabouts was not
known; of others the existence was not suspected. But Mr Child was
untiring. He was cordially assisted by various scholars, antiquaries,
and private gentlemen, to whose co[:o]peration ample testimony is
borne in the Advertisements prefixed to the volumes in the present
work. Some manuscripts were secured for the Library of Harvard
University--notably Bishop Percy's Papers, the Kinloch MSS, and
the Harris MS.,[8]--and of others careful copies were made, which
became the property of the same library. In all these operations the
indispensable good offices of Mr William Macmath, of Edinburgh, deserve
particular mention. For a long series of years his services were always
at Mr Child's disposal. His self-sacrifice and generosity appear to
have been equalled only by his perseverance and wonderful accuracy.
But for him the manuscript basis of The English and Scottish Popular
Ballads would have been far less strong than it is.

Gradually, then, the manuscript materials came in, until at last, in
1882, Mr Child felt justified in beginning to print. Other important
documents were, however, discovered or made accessible as time went on.
Especially noteworthy was the great find at Abbotsford (see the
Advertisement to Part VIII). In 1877 Dr David Laing procured, "not
without difficulty," leave to prepare for Mr Child a copy of the single
manuscript of ballads then known to remain in the library at Abbotsford.
This MS., entitled "Scottish Songs," was so inconsiderable, in
proportion to the accumulations which Sir Walter Scott had made in
preparing his Border Minstrelsy, that further search seemed to be
imperatively necessary. In 1890 permission to make such a search, and to
use the results, was given by the Honorable Mrs Maxwell-Scott. The
investigation, made by Mr Macmath, yielded a rich harvest of ballads,
which were utilized in Parts VII-IX. To dwell upon the details would be
endless. The reader may see a list of the manuscript sources at pp. 397
ff. of the fifth volume; and, if he will observe how scattered they
were, he will have no difficulty in believing that it required years,
labor, and much delicate negotiation to bring them all together. One
manuscript remained undiscoverable, William Tytler's Brown MS., but
there is no reason to believe that this contained anything of
consequence that is not otherwise known.[9]

Meanwhile, concurrently with the toil of amassing, collating, and
arranging texts, went on the far more arduous labor of comparative study
of the ballads of all nations; for, in accordance with Mr Child's plan
it was requisite to determine, in the fullest manner, the history and
foreign relations of every piece included in his collection. To this end
he devoted much time and unwearied diligence to forming, in the Library
of the University, a special collection of "Folk-lore," particularly of
ballads, romances, and _M[:a]rchen_. This priceless collection, the
formation of which must be looked on as one of Mr Child's most striking
services to the university, numbers some 7000 volumes. But these figures
by no means represent the richness of the Library in the departments
concerned, or the services of Mr Child in this particular. Medi[ae]val
literature in all its phases was his province, and thousands of volumes
classified in other departments of the University Library bear testimony
to his vigilance in ordering books, and his astonishing bibliographical
knowledge. Very few books are cited in the present collection which are
not to be found on the shelves of this Library.

In addition, Mr Child made an effort to stimulate the collection of such
remains of the traditional ballad as still live on the lips of the
people in this country and in the British Islands. The harvest was, in
his opinion, rather scanty; yet, if all the versions thus recovered from
tradition were enumerated, the number would not be found inconsiderable.
Enough was done, at all events, to make it clear that little or nothing
of value remains to be recovered in this way.

To readers familiar with such studies, no comment is necessary, and to
those who are unfamiliar with them, no form of statement can convey even
a faint impression of the industry, the learning, the acumen, and the
literary skill which these processes required. In writing the history of
a single ballad, Mr Child was sometimes forced to examine hundreds of
books in perhaps a dozen different languages. But his industry was
unflagging, his sagacity was scarcely ever at fault, and his linguistic
and literary knowledge seemed to have no bounds. He spared no pains to
perfect his work in every detail, and his success was commensurate with
his efforts. In the Advertisement to the Ninth Part (1894), he was able
to report that the three hundred and five numbers of his collection
comprised the whole extant mass of this traditional material, with the
possible exception of a single ballad.[10]

In June, 1896, Mr Child concluded his fiftieth year of service as a
teacher in Harvard College. He was at this time hard at work on the
Tenth and final Part, which was to contain a glossary, various indexes,
a bibliography, and an elaborate introduction on the general subject.
For years he had allowed himself scarcely any respite from work, and, in
spite of the uncertain condition of his health,--or perhaps in
consequence of it,--he continued to work at high pressure throughout the
summer. At the end of August he discovered that he was seriously ill. He
died at Boston on the 11th day of September. He had finished his great
work except for the introduction and the general bibliography. The
bibliography was in preparation by another hand and has since been
completed. The introduction, however, no other scholar had the hardihood
to undertake. A few pages of manuscript,--the last thing written by his
pen,--almost illegible, were found among his papers to show that he had
actually begun the composition of this essay, and many sheets of
excerpts testified to the time he had spent in refreshing his memory as
to the opinions of his predecessors, but he had left no collectanea that
could be utilized in supplying the Introduction itself. He was
accustomed to carry much of his material in his memory till the moment
of composition arrived, and this habit accounts for the fact that there
are no jottings of opinions and no sketch of precisely what line of
argument he intended to take.

Mr Child's sudden death was felt as a bitter personal loss, not only by
an unusually large circle of attached friends in both hemispheres, but
by very many scholars who knew him through his works alone. He was one
of the few learned men to whom the old title of "Master" was justly due
and freely accorded. With astonishing erudition, which nothing seemed to
have escaped, he united an infectious enthusiasm and a power of lucid
and fruitful exposition that made him one of the greatest of teachers,
and a warmth and openness of heart that won the affection of all who
knew him. In most men, however complex their characters, one can
distinguish the qualities of the heart, in some degree, from the
qualities of the head. In Professor Child no such distinction was
possible, for all the elements of his many-sided nature were fused in
his marked and powerful individuality. In his case, the scholar and the
man cannot be separated. His life and his learning were one; his work
was the expression of himself.

As an investigator Professor Child was at once the inspiration and the
despair of his disciples. Nothing could surpass the scientific exactness
of his methods and the unwearied diligence with which he conducted his
researches. No possible source of information could elude him; no book
or manuscript was too voluminous or too unpromising for him to examine
on the chance of its containing some fact that might correct or
supplement his material, even in the minutest point. Yet these qualities
of enthusiastic accuracy and thoroughness, admirable as they undoubtedly
were, by no means dominated him. They were always at the command of the
higher qualities of his genius,--sagacity, acumen, and a kind of
sympathetic and imaginative power in which he stood almost alone among
recent scholars. No detail of language or tradition or arch[ae]ology was to
him a mere lifeless fact; it was transmuted into something vital, and
became a part of that universal humanity which always moved him wherever
he found it, whether in the pages of a medi[ae]val chronicle, or in the
stammering accents of a late and vulgarly distorted ballad, or in the
faces of the street boys who begged roses from his garden. No man ever
felt a keener interest in his kind, and no scholar ever brought this
interest into more vivifying contact with the technicalities of his
special studies. The exuberance of this large humanity pervades his
edition of the English and Scottish ballads. Even in his last years,
when the languor of uncertain health sometimes got the better, for a
season, of the spirit with which he commonly worked, some fresh bit of
genuine poetry in a ballad, some fine trait of pure nature in a stray
folk-tale, would, in an instant, bring back the full flush of that
enthusiasm which he must have felt when the possibilities of his
achievement first presented themselves to his mind in early manhood. For
such a nature there was no old age.

From this ready sympathy came that rare faculty--seldom possessed by
scholars--which made Professor Child peculiarly fit for his greatest
task. Few persons understand the difficulties of ballad investigation.
In no field of literature have the forger and the manipulator worked
with greater vigor and success. From Percy's day to our own it has been
thought an innocent device to publish a bit of one's own versifying, now
and then, as an "old ballad" or an "ancient song." Often, too, a late
stall-copy of a ballad, getting into oral circulation, has been
innocently furnished to collectors as traditional matter. Mere learning
will not guide an editor through these perplexities. What is needed is,
in addition, a complete understanding of the "popular" genius, a
sympathetic recognition of the traits that characterize oral literature
wherever and in whatever degree they exist. This faculty, which even the
folk has not retained, and which collectors living in ballad-singing and
tale-telling times have often failed to acquire, was vouchsafed by
nature herself to this sedentary scholar. In reality a kind of instinct,
it had been so cultivated by long and loving study of the traditional
literature of all nations that it had become wonderfully swift in its
operations and almost infallible. A forged or retouched piece could not
deceive him for a moment; he detected the slightest jar in the genuine
ballad tone. He speaks in one place of certain writers "who would have
been all the better historians for a little reading of romances." He was
himself the better interpreter of the poetry of art for this keen
sympathy with the poetry of nature.

Constant association with the spirit of the folk did its part in
maintaining, under the stress of unremitting study and research, that
freshness and buoyancy of mind which was the wonder of all who met
Professor Child for the first time, and the perpetual delight of his
friends and associates. It is impossible to describe the charm of his
familiar conversation. There was endless variety without effort. His
peculiar humor, taking shape in a thousand felicities of thought and
phrase that fell casually and as it were inevitably from his lips,
exhilarated without reaction or fatigue. His lightest words were full of
fruitful suggestion. Sudden strains of melancholy or high seriousness
were followed, in a moment, by flashes of gaiety almost boyish. And
pervading it all one felt the attraction of his personality and the
goodness of his heart.

Professor Child's humor was not only one of his most striking
characteristics as a man; it was of constant service to his scholarly
researches. Keenly alive to any incongruity in thought or fact, and the
least self-conscious of men, he scrutinized his own nascent theories
with the same humorous shrewdness with which he looked at the ideas of
others. It is impossible to think of him as the sponsor of some
hypotheses which men of equal eminence have advanced and defended with
passion; and, even if his goodness of nature had not prevented it, his
sense of the ridiculous would not have suffered him to engage in the
absurdities of philological polemics. In the interpretation of
literature, his humor stood him in good stead, keeping his native
sensibility under due control, so that it never degenerated into
sentimentalism. It made him a marvelous interpreter of Chaucer, whose
spirit he had caught to a degree attained by no other scholar or
critic.

To younger scholars Professor Child was an influence at once stimulating
and benignant. To confer with him was always to be stirred to greater
effort, but, at the same time, the serenity of his devotion to learning
chastened the petulance of immature ambition in others. The talk might
be quite concrete, even definitely practical,--it might deal with
indifferent matters; but, in some way, there was an irradiation of the
master's nature that dispelled all unworthy feelings. In the presence of
his noble modesty the bustle of self-assertion was quieted and the petty
spirit of pedantic wrangling could not assert itself. However severe his
criticism, there were no personalities in it. He could not be other than
outspoken,--concealment and shuffling were abhorrent to him,--yet such
was his kindliness that his frankest judgments never wounded; even his
reproofs left no sting. With his large charity was associated, as its
necessary complement in a strong character, a capacity for righteous
indignation. "He is almost the only man I know," said one in his
lifetime, "who _thinks no evil_." There could be no truer word. Yet when
he was confronted with injury or oppression, none could stand against
the anger of this just man. His unselfishness did not suffer him to see
offences against himself, but wrong done to another roused him in an
instant to protesting action.

Professor Child's publications, despite their magnitude and
importance, are no adequate measure either of his acquirements or of
his influence. He printed nothing about Shakspere, for example, yet he
was the peer of any Shaksperian, past or present, in knowledge and
interpretative power. As a Chaucer scholar he had no superior, in this
country or in Europe: his published work was confined, as we have
seen, to questions of language, but no one had a wider or closer
acquaintance with the whole subject. An edition of Chaucer from his
hand would have been priceless. His acquaintance with letters was not
confined to special authors or centuries. He was at home in modern
European literature and profoundly versed in that of the Middle Ages.
In his immediate territory,--English,--his knowledge, linguistic and
literary, covered all periods, and was alike exact and thorough. His
taste and judgment were exquisite, and he enlightened every subject
which he touched. As a writer, he was master of a singularly
felicitous style, full of individuality and charm. Had his time not
been occupied in other ways, he would have made the most delightful of
essayists.

Fortunately, Professor Child's courses of instruction in the
university--particularly those on Chaucer and Shakspere--gave him an
opportunity to impart to a constantly increasing circle of pupils the
choicest fruits of his life of thought and study. In his later years he
had the satisfaction to see grow up about him a school of young
specialists who can have no higher ambition than to be worthy of their
master. But his teaching was not limited to these,--it included all
sorts and conditions of college students; and none, not even the idle
and incompetent, could fail to catch something of his spirit. One thing
may be safely asserted: no university teacher was ever more beloved.

And with this may fitly close too slight a tribute to the memory of a
great scholar and a good man. Many things remain unsaid. His gracious
family life, his civic virtues, his patriotism, his bounty to the
poor,--all must be passed by with a bare mention, which yet will signify
much to those who knew him. In all ways he lived worthily, and he died
having attained worthy ends.

The four copies of #A# differ but very slightly: #a#, #b#, #c# are
broadsides, and #d# is evidently of that derivation, #a# and #b# are of
the 17th century. There is another broadside in the Euing collection,
formerly Halliwell's, No 253. The version in The Borderer's Table Book,
VII, 83, was compounded by Dixon from others previously printed.

Riddles, as is well known, play an important part in popular story, and
that from very remote times. No one needs to be reminded of Samson,
[OE]dipus, Apollonius of Tyre. Riddle-tales, which, if not so old as the
oldest of these, may be carried in all likelihood some centuries beyond
our era, still live in Asiatic and European tradition, and have their
representatives in popular ballads. The largest class of these tales is
that in which one party has to guess another's riddles, or two rivals
compete in giving or guessing, under penalty in either instance of
forfeiting life or some other heavy wager; an example of which is the
English ballad, modern in form, of 'King John and the Abbot of
Canterbury.' In a second class, a suitor can win a lady's hand only by
guessing riddles, as in our 'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship' and 'Proud
Lady Margaret.' There is sometimes a penalty of loss of life for the
unsuccessful, but not in these ballads. Thirdly, there is the tale
(perhaps an offshoot of an early form of the first) of The Clever Lass,
who wins a husband, and sometimes a crown, by guessing riddles, solving
difficult but practicable problems, or matching and evading
impossibilities; and of this class versions #A# and #B# of the present
ballad and #A-H# of the following are specimens.

Ballads like our 1, #A#, #B#, 2, #A-H#, are very common in #German#. Of
the former variety are the following:

#A.# 'R[:a]thsellied,' B[:u]sching, W[:o]chentliche Nachrichten, I,
65, from the neighborhood of Stuttgart. The same, Erlach, III, 37;
Wunderhorn, IV, 139; Liederhort, p. 338, No 153; Erk u. Irmer, H. 5,
p. 32, No 29; Mittler, No 1307 (omits the last stanza); Zuccalmaglio,
II, 574, No 317 [with change in st. 11]. A knight meets a maid on the
road, dismounts, and says, "I will ask you a riddle; if you guess
it, you shall be my wife." She answers, "Your riddle shall soon be
guessed; I will do my best to be your wife;" guesses eight pairs of
riddles, is taken up behind him, and they ride off. #B.# 'R[:a]thsel
um R[:a]thsel,' Wunderhorn, II, 407 [429, 418]==Erlach, I, 439.
Zuccalmaglio, II, 572, No 316, rearranges, but adds nothing. Mittler,
No 1306, inserts three stanzas (7, 9, 10). This version begins: "Maid,
I will give you some riddles, and if you guess them will marry you."
There are seven pairs, and, these guessed, the man says, "I can't
give you riddles; let's marry;" to which she gives no coy assent:
but this conclusion is said not to be genuine (Liederhort, p. 341,
note). #C.# 'R[:a]thsellied,' Erk, Neue Sammlung, Heft 3, p. 64, No
57, and Liederhort, 340, No 153^a two Brandenburg versions, nearly
agreeing, one with six, the other with five, pairs of riddles. A
proper conclusion not having been obtained, the former was completed
by the two last stanzas of #B#, which are suspicious. #C# begins
like #B#. #D.# 'R[:a]thselfragen,' Peter, Volksth[:u]mliches aus
[:O]sterreichisch-Schlesien, I, 272, No 83. A knight rides by where
two maids are sitting, one of whom salutes him, the other not. He says
to the former, "I will put you three questions, and if you can answer
them will marry you." He asks three, then six more, then three, and
then two, and, all being answered, bids her, since she is so witty,
build a house on a needle's point, and put in as many windows as there
are stars in the sky; which she parries with, "When all streams flow
together, and all trees shall fruit, and all thorns bear roses, then
come for your answer." #E.# 'R[:a]thsellied,' Tschischka u. Schottky,
Oesterreichische Volkslieder, 2d ed., p. 28, begins like #B#, #C#, has
only three pairs of riddles, and ends with the same task of building a
house on a needle's point. #F.# 'R[:a]thsellied,' Hocker, Volkslieder
von der Mosel, in Wolf's Zeits. f[:u]r deutsche Myth., I, 251, from
Trier, begins with the usual promise, has five pairs of riddles, and no
conclusion. #G.# 'R[:a]thsel,' Ditfurth, Fr[:a]nkische V. L., II, 110,
No 146, has the same beginning, six pairs of riddles, and no conclusion.

Some of the riddles occur in nearly all the versions, some in only one
or two, and there is now and then a variation also in the answers. Those
which are most frequent are:

    Which is the maid without a tress? #A-D#, #G#.
    And which is the tower without a crest? #A-D#, #F#, #G#.
      (Maid-child in the cradle; tower of Babel.)
    Which is the water without any sand? #A#, #B#, #C#, #F#, #G#.
    And which is the king without any land? #A#, #B#, #C#, #F#, #G#.
      (Water in the eyes; king in cards.)
    Where is no dust in all the road? #A-G.#
    Where is no leaf in all the wood? #A-G.#
      (The milky way, or a river; a fir-wood.)
    Which is the fire that never burnt? #A#, #C-G#.
    And which is the sword without a point? #C-G.#
      (A painted fire; a broken sword.)
    Which is the house without a mouse? #C-G.#
    Which is the beggar without a louse? #C-G.#
      (A snail's house; a painted beggar.)[11]

A ballad translated in Ralston's Songs of the Russian People, p. 356,
from Buslaef's Historical Sketches of National Literature and Art, I,
31, resembles very closely German #A#. A merchant's son drives by a
garden where a girl is gathering flowers. He salutes her; she returns
her thanks. Then the ballad proceeds:

    'Shall I ask thee riddles, beauteous maiden?
    Six wise riddles shall I ask thee?'
    'Ask them, ask them, merchant's son,
    Prithee ask the six wise riddles.'
    'Well then, maiden, what is higher than the forest?
    Also, what is brighter than the light?
    Also, maiden, what is thicker than the forest?
    Also, maiden, what is there that's rootless?
    Also, maiden, what is never silent?
    Also, what is there past finding out?'
    'I will answer, merchant's son, will answer,
    All the six wise riddles will I answer.
    Higher than the forest is the moon;
    Brighter than the light the ruddy sun;
    Thicker than the forest are the stars;
    Rootless is, O merchant's son, a stone;
    Never silent, merchant's son, the sea;
    And God's will is past all finding out.'
    'Thou hast guessed, O maiden fair, guessed rightly,
    All the six wise riddles hast thou answered;
    Therefore now to me shalt thou be wedded,
    Therefore, maiden, shalt thou be the merchant's wife.'[12]

Among the Gaels, both Scotch and Irish, a ballad of the same description
is extremely well known. Apparently only the questions are preserved in
verse, and the connection with the story made by a prose comment. Of
these questions there is an Irish form, dated 1738, which purports to be
copied from a manuscript of the twelfth century. Fionn would marry no
lady whom he could pose. Graidhne, "daughter of the king of the fifth of
Ullin," answered everything he asked, and became his wife. Altogether
there are thirty-two questions in the several versions. Among them are:
What is blacker than the raven? (There is death.) What is whiter than
the snow? (There is the truth.) 'Fionn's Questions,' Campbell's Popular
Tales of the West Highlands, III, 36; 'Fionn's Conversation with
Ailbhe,'Heroic Gaelic Ballads, by the same, pp. 150, 151.

The familiar ballad-knight of #A#, #B# is converted in #C# into an "unco
knicht," who is the devil, a departure from the proper story which is
found also in #2 J#. The conclusion of #C#,

    As soon as she the fiend did name,
    He flew awa in a blazing flame,

reminds us of the behavior of trolls and nixes under like circumstances,
but here the naming amounts to a detection of the Unco Knicht's
quiddity, acts as an exorcism, and simply obliges the fiend to go off in
his real character. #D# belongs with #C#: it was given by the reciter as
a colloquy between the devil and a maiden.

The earlier affinities of this ballad can be better shown in connection
with No 2.

    He knocked at the ladie's gate
    One evening when it was late.

    5
    The eldest sister let him in,
    And pin'd the door with a silver pin.

    6
    The second sister she made his bed,
    And laid soft pillows under his head.

    7
    The youngest daughter that same night,
    She went to bed to this young knight.

    8
    And in the morning, when it was day,
    These words unto him she did say:

    9
    'Now you have had your will,' quoth she,
    'I pray, sir knight, will you marry me?'

    10
    The young brave knight to her replyed,
    'Thy suit, fair maid, shall not be deny'd.

    11
    'If thou canst answer me questions three,
    This very day will I marry thee.'

    12
    'Kind sir, in love, O then,' quoth she,
    'Tell me what your [three] questions be.'

    13
    'O what is longer than the way,
    Or what is deeper than the sea?

    14
    'Or what is louder than the horn,
    Or what is sharper than a thorn?

    15
    'Or what is greener than the grass,
    Or what is worse then a woman was?'

    16
    'O love is longer than the way,
    And hell is deeper than the sea.

    17
    'And thunder is louder than the horn,
    And hunger is sharper than a thorn.

    18
    'And poyson is greener than the grass,
    And the Devil is worse than woman was.'

    19
    When she these questions answered had,
    The knight became exceeding glad.

    20
    And having [truly] try'd her wit,
    He much commended her for it.

    21
    And after, as it is verifi'd,
    He made of her his lovely bride.

    22
    So now, fair maidens all, adieu,
    This song I dedicate to you.

    23
    I wish that you may constant prove
    Vnto the man that you do love.

Pinkerton gave the first information concerning #A#, in Ancient Scotish
Poems ... from the MS. collections of Sir Richard Maitland, etc., II,
496, and he there printed the first and last stanzas of the broadside.
Motherwell printed the whole in the appendix to his Minstrelsy, No I.
What stands as the last stanza in the broadside is now prefixed to the
ballad, as having been the original burden. It is the only example, so
far as I remember, which our ballads afford of a burden of this kind,
one that is of greater extent than the stanza with which it was sung,
though this kind of burden seems to have been common enough with old
songs and carols.[13]

The "old copy in black letter" used for #B# was close to #A#, if not
identical, and has the burden-stem at the end like #A#. 'The Jockey's
Lamentation,' Pills to Purge Melancholy, v, 317, has the burden,

    'Tis oer the hills and far away [_thrice_],
    The wind hath blown my plaid away.

The 'Bridal Sark,' Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p.
108, and 'The Bridegroom Darg,' p. 113, are of modern manufacture and
impostures; at least, they seem to have imposed upon Cromek.

A like ballad is very common in German. A man would take, or keep, a
woman for his love or his wife [servant, in one case], if she would spin
brown silk from oaten straw. She will do this if he will make clothes
for her of the linden-leaf. Then she must bring him shears from the
middle of the Rhine. But first he must build her a bridge from a single
twig, etc., etc. To this effect, with some variations in the tasks set,
in #A#, 'Eitle Dinge,' Rhaw, Bicinia (1545), Uhland, I, 14, No 4 A,
B[:o]hme, p. 376, No 293. #B.# 'Van ideln unm[:o]glichen Dingen,' Neocorus

is a simple contest of wits between a youth and a maid, and in #M#, Erk,
Neue Sammlung, #H.# 2, No 11, p. 16, and #N#, 'Wunderbare Aufgaben,'
Pr[:o]hle, Weltliche u. geistliche Volkslieder, p. 36, No 22 B, the
wit-contest is added to the very insipid ballad of 'Gemalte Rosen.'

'Store Fordringar,' Kristensen, Jydske Folkeviser, I, 221, No 82, and
'Opsang,' Lindeman, Norske Fjeldmelodier, No 35 (Text Bilag, p. 6),
closely resemble German #M#, #N#. In the Stev, or alternate song, in
Landstad, p. 375, two singers vie one with another in propounding
impossible tasks.

A Wendish ballad, Haupt and Schmaler, I, 178, No 151, and a Slovak,
[vC]elakowsky, II, 68, No 12 (the latter translated by Wenzig, Slawische
Volkslieder, p. 86, Westslavischer M[:a]rchenschatz, p. 221, and Bibliothek
Slavischer Poesien, p. 126), have lost nearly all their story, and, like
German #K#, #L#, may be called mere wit-contests.

The Graidhne whom we have seen winning Fionn for husband by guessing his
riddles, p. 3, afterwards became enamored of Diarmaid, Fionn's nephew,
in consequence of her accidentally seeing a beauty spot on Diarmaid's
forehead. This had the power of infecting with love any woman whose eye
should light upon it: wherefore Diarmaid used to wear his cap well down.
Graidhne tried to make Diarmaid run away with her. But he said, "I will
not go with thee. I will not take thee in softness, and I will not take
thee in hardness; I will not take thee without, and I will not take thee
within; I will not take thee on horseback, and I will not take thee on
foot." Then he went and built himself a house where he thought he should
be out of her way. But Graidhne found him out. She took up a position
between the two sides of the door, on a buck goat, and called to him to
go with her. For, said she, "I am not without, I am not within; I am not
on foot, and I am not on a horse; and thou must go with me." After this
Diarmaid had no choice. 'Diarmaid and Grainne,' Tales of the West
Highlands, III, 39-49; 'How Fingal got Graine to be his wife, and she
went away with Diarmaid,' Heroic Gaelic Ballads, p. 153; 'The Death of
Diarmaid,' ib., p. 154. The last two were written down c. 1774.

In all stories of the kind, the person upon whom a task is imposed
stands acquitted, if another of no less difficulty is devised which must
be performed first. This preliminary may be something that is essential
for the execution of the other, as in the German ballads, or equally
well something that has no kind of relation to the original requisition,
as in the English ballads.

An early form of such a story is preserved in Gesta Romanorum, c. 64,
Oesterley, p. 374. It were much to be wished that search were made for a
better copy, for, as it stands, this tale is to be interpreted only by
the English ballad. The old English version, Madden, XLIII, p. 142, is
even worse mutilated than the Latin. A king, who was stronger, wiser,
and handsomer than any man, delayed, like the Marquis of Saluzzo, to
take a wife. His friends urged him to marry, and he replied to their
expostulations, "You know I am rich enough and powerful enough; find me
a maid who is good looking and sensible, and I will take her to wife,
though she be poor." A maid was found who was eminently good looking and
sensible, and of royal blood besides. The king wished to make trial of
her sagacity, and sent her a bit of linen three inches square, with a
promise to marry her if she would make him a shirt of this, of proper
length and width. The lady stipulated that the king should send her "a
vessel in which she could work," and she would make the shirt: "michi
vas concedat in quo operari potero, et camisiam satis longam ei
promitto." So the king sent "vas debitum et preciosum," the shirt was
made, and the king married her.[14] It may be doubted whether the
sagacious maid did not, in the unmutilated story, deal with the problem
as is done in a Transylvanian tale, Haltrich, Deutsche Volksm[:a]rchen,
u.s.w., No 45, p. 245, where the king requires the maid to make a shirt
and drawers of two threads. The maid, in this instance, sends the king a
couple of broomsticks, requiring that he should first make her a loom
and bobbin-wheel out of them.

The tale just cited, 'Der Burgh[:u]ter und seine kluge Tochter,' is one of
several which have been obtained from tradition in this century, that
link the ballads of The Clever Lass with oriental stories of great age.
The material points are these. A king requires the people of a parish
to answer three questions, or he will be the destruction of them all:
What is the finest sound, the finest song, the finest stone? A poor
warder is instructed by his daughter to reply, the ring of bells, the
song of the angels, the philosopher's stone. "Right," says the king,
"but that never came out of your head. Confess who told you, or a
dungeon is your doom." The man owns that he has a clever daughter, who
had told him what to say. The king, to prove her sagacity further,
requires her to make a shirt and drawers of two threads, and she
responds in the manner just indicated. He next sends her by her father
an earthen pot with the bottom out, and tells her to sew in a bottom so
that no seam or stitch can be seen. She sends her father back with a
request that the king should first turn the pot inside out, for cobblers
always sew on the inside, not on the out. The king next demanded that
the girl should come to him, neither driving, nor walking, nor riding;
neither dressed nor naked; neither out of the road nor in the road; and
bring him something that was a gift and no gift. She put two wasps
between two plates, stripped, enveloped herself in a fishing net, put
her goat into the rut in the road, and, with one foot on the goat's
back, the other stepping along the rut, made her way to the king. There
she lifted up one of the plates, and the wasps flew away: so she had
brought the king a present and yet no present. The king thought he could
never find a shrewder woman, and married her.

Of the same tenor are a tale in Zingerle's Tyrolese Kinder u.
Hausm[:a]rchen, 'Was ist das Sch[:o]nste, St[:a]rkste und Reichste?'
No 27, p. 162, and another in the Colshorns' Hanoverian M[:a]rchen u.
Sagen, 'Die kluge Dirne,' No 26, p. 79. Here a rich and a poor peasant
[a farmer and his bailiff] have a case in court, and wrangle till the
magistrate, in his weariness, says he will give them three questions,
and whichever answers right shall win. The questions in the former tale
are: What is the most beautiful, what the strongest, what the richest
thing in the world? In the other, What is fatter than fat? How heavy is
the moon? How far is it to heaven? The answers suggested by the poor
peasant's daughter are: Spring is the most beautiful of things, the
ground the strongest, autumn the richest. And the bailiff's daughter
answers: The ground is fatter than fat, for out of it comes all that's
fat, and this all goes back again; the moon has four quarters, and four
quarters make a pound; heaven is only one day's journey, for we read in
the Bible, "Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise." The judge sees
that these replies are beyond the wit of the respondents, and they own
to having been prompted by a daughter at home. The judge then says that
if the girl will come to him neither dressed nor naked, etc., he will
marry her; and so the shrewd wench becomes a magistrate's wife.

'Die kluge Bauerntochter,' in the Grimms' K. u. H. m[:a]rchen, No
94, and 'Die kluge Hirtentochter,' in Pr[:o]hle's M[:a]rchen f[:u]r
die Jugend, No 49, p. 181, afford another variety of these tales. A
peasant, against the advice of his daughter, carries the king a golden
mortar, as he had found it, without any pestle. The king shuts him
up in prison till he shall produce the pestle [Grimms]. The man does
nothing but cry, "Oh, that I had listened to my daughter!" The king
sends for him, and, learning what the girl's counsel had been, says
he will give her a riddle, and if she can make it out will marry her.
She must come to him neither clothed nor naked, neither riding nor
driving, etc. The girl wraps herself in a fishing net [Grimms, in
bark, Pr[:o]hle], satisfies the other stipulations also, and becomes a
queen.[15]

Another story of the kind, and very well preserved, is No 25 of Vuk's
Volksm[:a]rchen der Serben, 'Von dem M[:a]dchen das an Weisheit den Kaiser
[:u]bertraf,' p. 157. A poor man had a wise daughter. An emperor gave him
thirty eggs, and said his daughter must hatch chickens from these, or it
would go hard with her. The girl perceived that the eggs had been
boiled. She boiled some beans, and told her father to be ploughing along
the road, and when the emperor came in sight, to sow them and cry, "God
grant my boiled beans may come up!" The emperor, hearing these
ejaculations, stopped, and said, "My poor fellow, how _can_ boiled beans
grow?" The father answered, according to instructions, "As well as
chickens can hatch from boiled eggs." Then the emperor gave the old man
a bundle of linen, and bade him make of it, on pain of death, sails and
everything else requisite for a ship. The girl gave her father a piece
of wood, and sent him back to the emperor with the message that she
would perform what he had ordered, if he would first make her a distaff,
spindle, and loom out of the wood. The emperor was astonished at the
girl's readiness, and gave the old man a glass, with which she was to
drain the sea. The girl dispatched her father to the emperor again with
a pound of tow, and asked him to stop the mouths of all the rivers that
flow into the sea; then she would drain it dry. Hereupon the emperor
ordered the girl herself before him, and put her the question, "What is
heard furthest?" "Please your Majesty," she answered, "thunder and
lies." The emperor then, clutching his beard, turned to his assembled
counsellors, and said, "Guess how much my beard is worth." One said so
much, another so much. But the girl said, "Nay, the emperor's beard is
worth three rains in summer." The emperor took her to wife.

With these traditional tales we may put the story of wise Petronelle and
Alphonso, king of Spain, told after a chronicle, with his usual
prolixity, by Gower, Confessio Amantis, Pauli, I, 145 ff. The king
valued himself highly for his wit, and was envious of a knight who
hitherto had answered all his questions. Determined to confound his
humbler rival, he devised three which he thought unanswerable, sent for
the knight, and gave him a fortnight to consider his replies, which
failing, he would lose his goods and head. The knight can make nothing
of these questions, which are, What is that which needs help least and
gets most? What is worth most and costs least? What costs most and is
worth least? The girl, who is but fourteen years old, observing her
father's heavy cheer, asks him the reason, and obtains his permission to
go to court with him and answer the questions. He was to say to the king
that he had deputed her to answer, to make trial of her wits. The answer
to the first question is the earth, and agrees in the details with the
solution of the query, What is fatter than fat? in the Tyrolese and the
Hanoverian tale. Humility is the answer to the second, and pride the
third answer. The king admires the young maid, and says he would marry
her if her father were noble; but she may ask a boon. She begs for her
father an earldom which had lately escheated; and, this granted, she
reminds the king of what he had said; her father is now noble. The king
marries her.

In all these seven tales a daughter gets her father out of trouble by
the exercise of a superior understanding, and marries an emperor, a
king, or at least far above her station. The Grimms' story has the
feature, not found in the others, that the father had been thrown into
prison. Still another variety of these stories, inferior, but preserving
essential traits, is given by Schleicher, Litauische M[:a]rchen, p. 3, 'Vom
schlauen M[:a]dchen.'

A Turkish tale from South Siberia will take us a step further,
'Die beiden F[:u]rsten,' Radloff, Proben der Volkslitteratur der
t[:u]rkischen St[:a]mme S[:u]d-Sibiriens, I, 197. A prince had a
feeble-minded son, for whom he wished to get a wife. He found a girl
gathering fire-wood with others, and, on asking her questions, had
reason to be pleased with her superior discretion. He sent an ox to the
girl's father, with a message that on the third day he would pay him a
visit, and if by that time he had not made the ox drop a calf and give
milk, he would lose his head. The old man and his wife fell to weeping.
The daughter bade them be of good cheer, killed the ox, and gave it
to her parents to eat. On the third day she stationed herself on the
road by which the prince would come, and was gathering herbs. The
prince asked what this was for. The girl said, "Because my father is in
the pangs of child-birth, and I am going to spread these herbs under
him." "Why," said the prince, "it is not the way, that men should bear
children." "But if a man can't bear children," answered the girl, "how
can an ox have a calf?" The prince was pleased, but said nothing. He
went away, and sent his messenger again with three stones in a bag. He
would come on the third day, and if the stones were not then made into
boots, the old man would lose his head. On the third day the prince
came, with all his grandees. The girl was by the roadside, collecting
sand in a bag. "What are you going to do with that sand?" asked the
prince. "Make thread," said she. "But who ever made thread out of
sand?" "And who ever made boots out of stones?" she rejoined. The
prince laughed in his sleeve, prepared a great wedding, and married the
girl to his son. Soon after, another prince wrote him a letter, saying,
"Do not let us be fighting and killing, but let us guess riddles. If
you guess all mine, I will be your subject; if you fail, I will take
all your having." They were a whole year at the riddles. The other
prince "knew three words more," and threw ours into a deep dungeon.
From the depths of this dungeon he contrived to send a profoundly
enigmatic dispatch to his daughter-in-law, who understood everything,
disguised herself as one of his friends, and proposed to the victor to
guess riddles again. The clever daughter-in-law "knew seven words more"
than he, took her father-in-law out of the dungeon, threw his rival in,
and had all the people and property of the vanquished prince for her
own.

This Siberian tale links securely those which precede it with a
remarkable group of stories, covering by representatives still extant,
or which may be shown to have existed, a large part of Asia and of
Europe. This group includes, besides a Wallachian and a Magyar tale from
recent popular tradition, one Sanskrit form; two Tibetan, derived from
Sanskrit; one Mongol, from Tibetan; three Arabic and one Persian, which
also had their source in Sanskrit; two Middle-Greek, derived from
Arabic, one of which is lost; and two old Russian, from lost
Middle-Greek versions.[16]

The gist of these narratives is that one king propounds tasks to
another; in the earlier ones, with the intent to discover whether his
brother monarch enjoys the aid of such counsellors as will make an
attack on him dangerous; in the later, with a demand that he shall
acquit himself satisfactorily, or suffer a forfeit: and the king is
delivered from a serious strait by the sagacity either of a minister
(whom he had ordered to be put to death, but who was still living in
prison, or at least seclusion) or of the daughter of his minister, who
came to her father's assistance. Which is the prior of these two last
inventions it would not be easy to say. These tasks are always such as
require ingenuity of one kind or another, whether in devising practical
experiments, in contriving subterfuges, in solving riddles, or even in
constructing compliments.[17]

One of the Tibetan tales, which, though dating from the beginning of
our era, will very easily be recognized in the Siberian tradition of
this century, is to this effect. King Rabssaldschal had a rich minister,
who desired a suitable wife for his youngest son. A Brahman, his trusty
friend, undertook to find one. In the course of his search, which
extended through many countries, the Brahman saw one day a company of
five hundred maidens, who were making garlands to offer to Buddha. One
of these attracted his notice by her behavior, and impressed him
favorably by replies to questions which he put.[18] The Brahman made
proposals to her father in behalf of the minister's son. These were
accepted, and the minister went with a great train to fetch home the
bride. On the way back his life was twice saved by taking her advice,
and when she was domiciliated, she so surpassed her sisters-in-law in
housekeeping talents and virtues that everything was put under her
direction. Discord arose between the king of the country she had left
and Rabssaldschal, under whom she was now living. The former wished to
make trial whether the latter had an able and keen-witted minister or
not, and sent him two mares, dam and filly, exactly alike in appearance,
with the demand that he should distinguish them. Neither king nor
counsellor could discern any difference; but when the minister's
daughter heard of their difficulty, she said, "Nothing is easier. Tie
the two together and put grass before them; the mother will push the
best before the foal." This was done; the king decided accordingly, and
the hostile ambassador owned that he was right. Soon after, the foreign
prince sent two snakes, of the same size and form, and demanded which
was male, which female. The king and his advisers were again in a
quandary. The minister resorted to his daughter-in-law. She said, "Lay
them both on cotton-wool: the female will lie quiet, the male not; for
it is of the feminine nature to love the soft and the comfortable, which
the masculine cannot tolerate." They followed these directions; the king
gave his verdict, the ambassador acquiesced, the minister received
splendid presents. For a final trial the unfriendly king sent a long
stick of wood, of equal thickness, with no knots or marks, and asked
which was the under and which the upper end. No one could say. The
minister referred the question to his daughter. She answered, "Put the
stick into water: the root end will sink a little, the upper end float."
The experiment was tried; the king said to the ambassador, "This is the
upper end, this the root end," to which he assented, and great presents
were again given to the minister. The adverse monarch was convinced that
his only safe course was peace and conciliation, and sent his ambassador
back once more with an offering of precious jewels and of amity for the
future. This termination was highly gratifying to Rabssaldschal, who
said to his minister, How could you see through all these things? The
minister said, It was not I, but my clever daughter-in-law. When the
king learned this, he raised the young woman to the rank of his younger
sister.

The wise daughter is not found in the Sanskrit tale,[19] which also
differs from the Buddhist versions in this: that in the Sanskrit the
minister had become an object of displeasure to the king, and in
consequence had long been lying in prison when the crisis occurred
which rendered him indispensable, a circumstance which is repeated in
the tale of The Wise Heykar (Arabian Nights, Breslau transl., XIII, 73
ff, Cabinet des F['e]es, XXXIX, 266 ff) and in the Life of [AE]sop.
But The Clever Wench reappears in another tale in the same Sanskrit
collection (with that express title), and gives her aid to her father,
a priest, who has been threatened with banishment by his king if he
does not clear up a dark matter within five days. She may also be
recognized in Moradbak, in Von der Hagen's 1001 Tag, VIII, 199 ff, and
even in the minister's wife in the story of The Wise Heykar.

The tasks of discriminating dam and filly and the root end from
the tip end of a stick, which occur both in the Tibetan tales and
the Shukasaptati, are found again, with unimportant changes, in
the Wallachian popular story, and the Hungarian, which in general
resemble the Arabic. Some of those in the Arabian tale and in the Life
of [AE]sop are of the same nature as the wit-trials in the Servian
and German popular tales, the story in the Gesta Romanorum, and the
German and English ballads. The wise Heykar, e.g., is required to sew
together a burst mill-stone. He hands the king a pebble, requesting
him first to make an awl, a file, and scissors out of that. The king
of Egypt tells [AE]sop, the king of Babylon's champion sage, that when
his mares hear the stallions neigh in Babylon, they cast their foal.
[AE]sop's slaves are told to catch a cat, and are set to scourging it
before the Egyptian public. Great offense is given, on account of the
sacred character of the animal, and complaint is made to the king,
who sends for [AE]sop in a rage. [AE]sop says his king has suffered
an injury from this cat, for the night before the cat had killed a
fine fighting-cock of his. "Fie, [AE]sop!" says the king of Egypt;
"how could the cat go from Egypt to Babylon in one night?" "Why not,"
replies [AE]sop, "as well as mares in Egypt hear the stallions neigh in
Babylon and cast their foal?"

The tales in the Shukasaptati and in the Dsanglun represent the object
of the sending of the tasks to be to ascertain whether the king retains
the capable minister through whom he has acquired supremacy. According
to the Arabian tale, and those derived from it, tribute is to be
paid by the king whose riddles are guessed, or by him who fails to
guess. This form of story, though it is a secondary one, is yet by no
means late, as is shown by the anecdote in Plutarch, Septem Sapientum
Convivium (6), itself probably a fragment of such a story, in which
the king of the [AE]thiops gives a task to Amasis, king of Egypt, with
a stake of many towns and cities. This task is the favorite one of
draining [drinking] all the water in the sea, which we have had in the
Servian tale (it also is in the Life of [AE]sop), and Bias gives the
customary advice for dealing with it.[20]

From the number of these wise virgins should not be excluded the king's
daughter in the Gesta Romanorum who guesses rightly among the riddles of
the three caskets and marries the emperor's son, though Bassanio has
extinguished her just fame: Madden's Old English Versions, p. 238, No
66; Collier, Shakspere's Library, II, 102.

The first three or four stanzas of #A-E# form the beginning of 'Lady
Isabel and the Elf-Knight,' and are especially appropriate to that
ballad, but not to this. The two last stanzas of #A#, #B#, make no
kind of sense here, and these at least, probably the opening verses
as well, must belong to some other and lost ballad. An elf setting
tasks, or even giving riddles, is unknown, I believe, in Northern
tradition, and in no form of this story, except the English, is a
preternatural personage of any kind the hero. Still it is better to
urge nothing more than that the elf is an intruder in this particular
ballad, for riddle-craft is practised by a variety of preternatural
beings: notoriously by Odin, Thor, the giant Vaf[th]r['u][dh]nir, and
the dwarf Alw['i]ss in the Edda, and again by a German "berggeist"
(Ey, Harzm[:a]rchenbuch, p. 64, 'Die verw[:u]nschte Prinzessin'), a
Greek dragon (Hahn, Griechisebe u. Albanesische M[:a]rchen, II, 210),
the Russian rusalka, the Servian vila,[21] the Indian rakshas. For
example: a rusalka (water-nymph) pursues a pretty girl, and says, I
will give you three riddles: if you guess them, I will let you go home
to your father; if you do not, I shall take you with me. What grows
without a root? What runs without any object? What blooms without
any flower? She answers, Stones grow without a root; water runs
without any object; the fern blooms without any flower. These answers
seem satisfactory, as riddles go, but the ballad concludes (with an
injustice due to corruption?), "The girl did not guess the riddles: the
rusalka tickled her to death." (Wojcicki, Pie['s]ni, I, 205.) A rakshas
(ogre) says he will spare a man's life if he can answer four questions,
and shall devour him if he cannot. What is cruel? What is most to
the advantage of a householder? What is love? What best accomplishes
difficult things? These questions the man answers, and confirms his
answers by tales, and gains the rakshas' good will. (Jacob, Hindoo
Tales, or the Adventures of Ten Princes, a translation of the Sanskrit
Dasakumaracharitam, p. 260 ff.)

The auld man in #J# is simply the "unco knicht" of #1 C#, #D#, over
again. He has clearly displaced the elf-knight, for the elf's attributes
of hill-haunting and magical music remain, only they have been
transferred to the lady. That the devil should supplant the knight, unco
or familiar, is natural enough. He may come in as the substitute of the
elfin knight because the devil is the regular successor to any heathen
sprite, or as the embodiment of craft and duplicity, and to give us the
pleasure of seeing him outwitted. We find the devil giving riddles, as
they are called (tasks), in the Grimms' K. u. H. m[:a]rchen, No 125 (see
also the note in vol. III); Pr[:o]hle's K. u. V. m[:a]rchen, No 19;
Vernaleken, Oesterreichische K. u. H. m[:a]rchen, No 37. He also appears as
a riddle-monger in one of the best stories in the Golden Legend. A
bishop, who was especially devoted to St Andrew, was tempted by Satan
under the semblance of a beautiful woman, and was all but lost, when a
loud knocking was heard at the door. A pilgrim demanded admittance. The
lady, being asked her pleasure about this, recommended that three
questions should be put to the stranger, to show whether he were fit to
appear in such presence. Two questions having been answered
unexceptionably, the fiend proposed a third, which was meant to be a
clincher: How far is it from earth to heaven? "Go back to him that sent
you," said the pilgrim (none other than St Andrew) to the messenger,
"and say that he himself knows best, for he measured the distance when
he fell." _Antiquus hostis de medio evanuit._ Much the same is related
in the legend of St Bartholomew, and, in a Slovenian ballad, of St
Ulrich, who interposes to save the Pope from espousing Satan in
disguise.[22]

    There stands a knicht at the tap o yon hill,
      Oure the hills and far awa
    He has blawn his horn loud and shall.
      The cauld wind's blawn my plaid awa

    2
    'If I had the horn that I hear blawn,
    And the knicht that blaws that horn!'

    3
    She had na sooner thae words said,
    Than the elfin knicht cam to her side.

    4
    'Are na ye oure young a may
    Wi onie young man doun to lie?'

    5
    'I have a sister younger than I,
    And she was married yesterday.'

    6
    'Married wi me ye sall neer be nane
    Till ye mak to me a sark but a seam.

    7
    'And ye maun shape it knife-, sheer-less,
    And ye maun sew it needle-, threed-less.

    8
    'And ye maun wash it in yon cistran,
    Whare water never stood nor ran.

    9
    'And ye maun dry it on yon hawthorn,
    Whare the sun neer shon sin man was born.'

    10
    'Gin that courtesie I do for thee,
    Ye maun do this for me.

    11
    'Ye'll get an acre o gude red-land
    Atween the saut sea and the sand.

    12
    'I want that land for to be corn,
    And ye maun aer it wi your horn.

    13
    'And ye maun saw it without a seed,
    And ye maun harrow it wi a threed.

    14
    'And ye maun shear it wi your knife,
    And na tyne a pickle o't for your life.

    15
    'And ye maun moue it in yon mouse-hole
    And ye maun thrash it in your shoe-sole.

    16
    'And ye maun fan it wi your luves,
    And ye maun sack it in your gloves.

    17
    'And ye maun bring it oure the sea,
    Fair and clean and dry to me.

    18
    'And whan that your wark is weill deen,
    Yese get your sark without a seam.'

    The Elfin knight stands on yon hill,
      Blaw, blaw, blaw winds, blaw
    Blawing his horn loud and shrill.
      And the wind has blawin my plaid awa

    2
    'If I had yon horn in my kist,
    And the bonny laddie here that I luve best!

    3
    'I hae a sister eleven years auld,
    And she to the young men's bed has made bauld.

    And oh! sae fain, luve, as I woud be thine.'

    'Ye maun make me a fine Holland sark,
    Without ony stitching or needle wark.

    6
    'And ye maun wash it in yonder well,
    Where the dew never wat, nor the rain ever fell.

    7
    'And ye maun dry it upon a thorn
    That never budded sin Adam was born.'

    8
    'Now sin ye've askd some things o me,
    It's right I ask as mony o thee.

    9
    'My father he askd me an acre o land,
    Between the saut sea and the strand.

    10
    'And ye maun plow 't wi your blawing horn,
    And ye maun saw 't wi pepper corn.

    11
    'And ye maun harrow 't wi a single tyne,
    And ye maun shear 't wi a sheep's shank bane.

    12
    'And ye maun big it in the sea,
    And bring the stathle dry to me.

    13
    'And ye maun barn 't in yon mouse hole,
    And ye maun thrash 't in your shee sole.

    14
    'And ye maun sack it in your gluve,
    And ye maun winno 't in your leuve.

    15
    'And ye maun dry 't without candle or coal,
    And grind it without quirn or mill.

    16
    'Ye'll big a cart o stane and lime,

[13] All that was required of the burden, Mr Chappell kindly writes me,
was to support the voice by harmonious notes under the melody; it was
not sung _after_ each half of the stanza, or after the stanza, and it
was heard separately only when the voices singing the air stopped. Even
the Danish ballads exhibit but a few cases of these "burden-stems," as
Grundwig calls them: see Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser, II, 221, B 1; 295,
B 1; 393, A 1: III, 197, D; 470, A. Such burden-stems are, however,
very common in Icelandic ballads. They are, for the most part, of a
different metre from the ballad, and very often not of the same number
of lines as the ballad stanza. A _part_ of the burden stem would seem
to be taken for the refrain; as ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, I, 30, of
four verses, 1, 2, 4; 129, of two, the last half of the first and all
the second; 194, of four, the last; 225, of five, the last two; II, 52,
of five, the second and last two.

In later times the Danish stev-stamme was made to conform to the metre
of the ballad, and sung as the first stanza, the last line perhaps
forming the burden. Compare the stev-stamme, Grundwig, III, 470, with
the first stanza of the ballad at p. 475. If not so changed, says
Grundtvig, it dropped away. Lyngbye, at the end of his F[ae]r[:o]iske
Qv[ae]der, gives the music of a ballad which he had heard sung. The
whole stem is sung first, and then repeated as a burden at the end
of every verse. The modern way, judging by Berggreen, Folke-Sange og
Melodier, 3d ed., I, 352, 358, is simply to sing the whole stem after
each verse, and so says Grundtvig, III, 200, D. The whole stem is
appended to the last stanza (where, as usual, the burden, which had
been omitted after stanza 1, is again expressed) in the F[ae]r[:o]e
ballad in Grundtvig, III, 199, exactly as in our broadside, or in
Motherwell's Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. iii. I must avow myself to be
very much in the dark as to the exact relation of stem and burden.

[14] Grundtvig has noticed the resemblance of G.R. 64 and the
ballad.--Much of what follows is derived from the admirable Benfey's
papers, 'Die kluge Dirne, Die indischen M[:a]rchen von den klugen
R[:a]thsell[:o]sern, und ihre Verbreitung [:u]ber Asien und Europa,'
Ausland, 1859, p. 457, 486, 511, 567, 589, in Nos 20, 21, 22, 24, 25.

[15] Ragnar Lo[dh]br['o]k (Saga, c. 4, Rafn, Fornaldar S[:o]gur, I,
245), as pointed out by the Grimms, notes to No 94, requires Kraka
(Aslaug) to come to him clothed and not clothed, fasting and not
fasting, alone and not without a companion. She puts on a fishing net,
bites a leek, and takes her dog with her. References for the very
frequent occurrence of this feature may be found in Oesterley's note to
Gesta Romanorum, No 124, at p. 732.

are: Shukasaptati (Seventy Tales of a Parrot), 47th and 48th night;

VII, 289 ff, Cabinet des F['e]es, XXV, 9-406 (from the Turkish?). In
the opinion of Benfey, it is in the highest degree likely, though
not demonstrable, that the Indian tale antedates our era by several
centuries. Ausland, p. 511; see also pp. 487, 459.

[17] Ingenuity is one of the six transcendental virtues of
Mah[=a]y[=a]na Buddhism. Schlagintweit, Buddhism in T['i]bet, p. 36.

[18] The resemblance to the Siberian tale is here especially striking.

[19] The Shukasaptati, in the form in which we have them, are supposed
to date from about the 6th century, and are regarded as abridgments of
longer tales. The Vinaya probably took a permanent shape as early as the
beginning of the Christian era. As already remarked, there is scarcely a
doubt that the Indian story is some centuries older still.

[20] Amasis in return (8) puts some of the questions which we are apt to
think of as peculiarly medi[ae]val: What is oldest? What is most beautiful,
biggest, wisest, strongest? etc. Two of these we have had in Zingerle's
story. They are answered in a commonplace way by the [AE]thiop, with more
refinement by Thales. Seven similar questions were propounded by David
to his sons, to determine who was worthiest to succeed him, and answered
by Solomon, according to an Arabian writer of the 14th century: Rosen[:o]l,
I, 167. Amasis also sent a victim to Bias (2), and asked him to cut out
the best and worst of the flesh. Bias cut out the tongue. Here the two
anticipate the Anglo-Saxon Salomon and Saturn: "Tell me what is best and
worst among men." "I tell thee word is best and worst:" Kemble, p. 188,
No 37; Adrian and Ritheus, p. 204, No 43; and Bed[ae] Collectanea, p. 326.
This is made into a very long story in the Life of [AE]sop, 11. See other
examples in Knust, Mittheilungen aus dem Eskurial, p. 326 f, note b, and
Nachtrag, p. 647; Oesterley's Kirchhof, V, 94, note to 3, 129; and
Landsberger, Die Fabeln des Sophos, CX, ff. We may add that Plutarch's
question, Which was first, the bird or the egg? (Qu[ae]st. Conviv. l. 2, q.
3), comes up again in The Demaundes Joyous, No 41, Kemble's Salomon and
Saturn, p. 290.

question and answer are in all the same. St Serf also has the credit
of having baffled the devil by answering occult questions in divinity:

THE FAUSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD

        #A.# 'The Fause Knight upon the Road,' Motherwell's
        Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxxiv.

        #B.# 'The False Knight,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
        Appendix, Musick, p. xxiv.


This singular ballad is known only through Motherwell. The opening
stanza of a second version is given by the editor of the music, Mr.
Blaikie, in the Appendix to the Minstrelsy. The idea at the bottom of
the piece is that the devil will carry off the wee boy if he can nonplus
him. So, in certain humorous stories, a fool wins a princess by
dumfounding her: e.g., Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery-Tales, p.
32; Von der Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, No 63, iii, 179; Asbj[/o]rnsen og
Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 4. But here the boy always gets the last
word. (See further on, under 'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship.')

An extremely curious Swedish ballad of the same description, from the
Lappfiord, Finland, with the substitution of an old crone, possibly
a witch, and clearly no better than one of the wicked, for the false
knight, is given by Oskar Rancken in N[oa]gra Prof af Folks[oa]ng och
Saga i det svenska [:O]sterbotten, p. 25, No 10. It is a point in both
that the replicant is a wee boy (gossen, som liten var).

    'Why are you driving over my field?' said the carlin:
    'Because the way lies over it,' answered the boy, who was a little
                                                                    fellow.

    'Yes, you in, and I outside.'

    'Yes, you in the sea, and I in a boat.'

Chambers, in his Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 66 of the new edition,
gives, without a word of explanation, a piece, 'Harpkin,' which
seems to have been of the same character, but now sounds only like a
"flyting."[23] The first stanza would lead us to expect that Harpkin
is to be a form of the Elfin Knight of the preceding ballad, but Fin
is seen to be the uncanny one of the two by the light of the other
ballads. Finn (Fin) is an ancestor of Woden, a dwarf in V[:o]lusp['a]
16 (19), and also a trold (otherwise a giant), who is induced by a
saint to build a church: Thiele, Danske Folkesagn, I, 45, Grimm,
Mythologie, p. 455. The name is therefore diabolic by many antecedents.

    Harpkin gaed up to the hill,
    And blew his horn loud and shrill,
      And by came Fin.

    'Spying the weather,' quo Harpkin.

    'To haud the cauld frae me,' quo Harpkin.

    4
    'Little cauld will that haud frae you,' quo Fin:
    'As little will it win through me,' quo Harpkin.

    5
    'I came by your door,' quo Fin:
    'It lay in your road,' quo Harpkin.

    6
    'Your dog barkit at me,' quo Fin:
    'It's his use and custom,' quo Harpkin.

    7
    'I flang a stane at him,' quo Fin:
    'I'd rather it had been a bane,' quo Harpkin.

    8
    'Your wife's lichter,' quo Fin:
    'She'll clim the brae the brichter,' quo Harpkin.

    9
    'Of a braw lad bairn,' quo Fin:
    'There'll be the mair men for the king's wars,' quo Harpkin.

    10
    'There's a strae at your beard,' quo Fin:
    'I'd rather it had been a thrave,' quo Harpkin.

    11
    'The ox is eating at it,' quo Fin:
    'If the ox were i the water,' quo Harpkin.

    12
    'And the water were frozen,' quo Fin:
    'And the smith and his fore-hammer at it,' quo Harpkin.

    13
    'And the smith were dead,' quo Fin:
    'And another in his stead,' quo Harpkin.

    14
    'Giff, gaff,' quo Fin:
    'Your mou's fou o draff,' quo Harpkin.

[23] At the last moment I come upon this: "The only safeguard against
the malice of witches is 'to flight wi dem,' that is, draw them into a
controversy and scold them roundly:" (Mrs Saxby, in an interesting
contribution of folk-lore from Unst, Shetland, in The Leisure Hour, for
March 27, 1880, p. 199.) This view, which has apparently affected
'Harpkin,' is clearly a modern misunderstanding. Let no one trust to
scolding for foiling a witch, unless he "knows more words."

Of all ballads this has perhaps obtained the widest circulation. It is
nearly as well known to the southern as to the northern nations of
Europe. It has an extraordinary currency in Poland. The Germans, Low and
High, and the Scandinavians, preserve it, in a full and evidently
ancient form, even in the tradition of this generation. Among the Latin
nations it has, indeed, shrunk to very meagre proportions, and though
the best English forms are not without ancient and distinctive marks,
most of these have been eliminated, and the better ballads are very
brief.

#A# has but thirteen two-line stanzas. An elf-knight, by blowing his
horn, inspires Lady Isabel with love-longing. He appears on her first
breathing a wish for him, and induces her to ride with him to the
greenwood.[24] Arrived at the wood, he bids her alight, for she is come
to the place where she is to die. He had slain seven kings' daughters
there, and she should be the eighth. She persuades him to sit down, with
his head on her knee, lulls him asleep with a charm, binds him with his
own sword-belt, and stabs him with his own dagger, saying, If seven
kings' daughters you have slain, lie here a husband to them all.

#B#, in fourteen four-line stanzas, begins unintelligibly with a bird
coming out of a bush for water, and a king's daughter sighing, "Wae 's
this heart o mine." A personage not characterized, but evidently of the
same nature as the elf-knight in #A#, lulls everybody but this king's
daughter asleep with his harp,[25] then mounts her behind him, and rides
to a piece of water called Wearie's Well. He makes her wade in up to her
chin; then tells her that he has drowned seven kings' daughters here,
and she is to be the eighth. She asks him for one kiss before she dies,
and, as he bends over to give it, pitches him from his saddle into the
water, with the words, Since ye have drowned seven here, I'll make you
bridegroom to them all.[26]

#C# was first published by David Herd, in the second edition of his
Scottish Songs, 1776, and afterwards by Motherwell, "collated" with a
copy obtained from recitation. #D#,[27] #E#, #F# are all broadside or
stall copies, and in broadside style. #C#, #D#, #E#, #F# have nearly the
same story. False Sir John, a knight from the south country [west
country, north lands], entices May Colven, #C#, #D# [a king's daughter,
#C# 16, #E# 16; a knight's daughter, Polly, #F# 4, 9], to ride off with
him, employing, in #D#, a charm which he has stuck in her sleeve. At the
knight's suggestion, #E#, #F#, she takes a good sum of money with her,
#D#, #E#, #F#. They come to a lonely rocky place by the sea [river-side,
#F#], and the knight bids her alight: he has drowned seven ladies here
[eight #D#, six #E#, #F#], and she shall be the next. But first she is
to strip off her rich clothes, as being too good to rot in the sea. She
begs him to avert his eyes, for decency's sake, and, getting behind him,
throws him into the water. In #F# he is absurdly sent for a sickle, to
crop the nettles on the river brim, and is pushed in while thus
occupied. He cries for help, and makes fair promises, #C#, #E#, but the
maid rides away, with a bitter jest [on his steed, #D#, leading his
steed, #E#, #F#], and reaches her father's house before daybreak. The
groom inquires in #D# about the strange horse, and is told that it is a
found one. The parrot asks what she has been doing, and is silenced with
a bribe; and when the father demands why he was chatting so early, says
he was calling to his mistress to take away the cat. Here #C#, #E#, #F#
stop, but #D# goes on to relate that the maid at once tells her parents
what has happened, and that the father rides off at dawn, under her
conduct, to find Sir John. They carry off the corpse, which lay on the
sands below the rocks, and bury it, for fear of discovery.

There is in Hone's Table Book, III, 130, ed. 1841, a _rifacimento_ by
Dixon of the common English broadside in what passes for old-ballad
style. This has been repeated in Richardson's Borderer's Table Book, VI,
367; in Dixon's Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p.
101; and, with alterations, additions, and omissions, in Sheldon's
Minstrelsy of the English Border, p. 194.

Jamieson (1814) had never met with this ballad in Scotland, at least in
anything like a perfect state; but he says that a tale to the same
effect, intermixed with scraps of verse, was familiar to him when a boy,
and that he afterwards found it, "in much the same state, in the
Highlands, in Lochaber and Ardnamurchan." According to the tradition
reported by Jamieson, the murderer had seduced the younger sister of his
wife, and was seeking to prevent discovery, a difference in the story
which might lead us to doubt the accuracy of Jamieson's recollection.
(Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 348.)

Stories like that of this ballad will inevitably be attached, and
perhaps more or less adapted, to localities where they become known. May
Collean, says Chambers, Scottish Ballads, p. 232, note, "finds locality
in that wild portion of the coast of Carrick (Ayrshire) which intervenes
betwixt Girvan and Ballantrae. Carlton Castle, about two miles to the
south of Girvan (a tall old ruin, situated on the brink of a bank which
overhangs the sea, and which gives title to Sir John Cathcart, Bart, of
Carlton), is affirmed by the country people, who still remember the
story with great freshness, to have been the residence of 'the fause Sir
John;' while a tall rocky eminence called Gamesloup, overhanging the sea
about two miles still further south, and over which the road passes in a
style terrible to all travellers, is pointed out as the place where he
was in the habit of drowning his wives, and where he was finally drowned
himself. The people, who look upon the ballad as a regular and proper
record of an unquestionable fact, farther affirm that May Collean was a
daughter of the family of Kennedy of Colzean," etc. Binyan's (Bunion)
Bay, in #D#, is, according to Buchan, the old name of the mouth of the
river Ugie.

Far better preserved than the English, and marked with very ancient and
impressive traits, is the Dutch ballad 'Halewijn,' which, not many years
ago, was extensively sung in Brabant and Flanders, and is still popular
as a broadside, both oral tradition and printed copies exhibiting
manifold variations. A version of this ballad (#A#) was communicated by
Willems to Mone's Anzeiger in 1836, col. 448 ff, thirty-eight two-line
stanzas, and afterwards appeared in Willems's Oude vlaemsche Liederen
(1848), No 49, p. 116, with some changes in the text and some various
readings. Uhland, I, 153, 74 D, gave the Anzeiger text, with one
correction. So Hoffmann, Niederl[:a]ndische Volkslieder, 2d ed., No 9, p.
39, but substituting for stanzas 19, 20 four stanzas from the margin of
O.v.L., and making other slighter changes. Baecker, Chants historiques
de la Flandre, No 9, p. 61, repeats Willems's second text, with one
careless omission and one transposition. Coussemaker, Chants populaires
des Flamands de France, No 45, p. 142, professes to give the text of
Oude vlaemsche Liederen, and does so nearly. Snellaert, Oude en nieuwe
Liedjes, 3d ed., 1864, No 55, p. 58, inserts seven stanzas in the place
of 33, 34 of O.v.L., and two after 35, making forty-five two- (or
three-) line stanzas instead of thirty-eight. These additions are also
found in an excessively corrupt form of the ballad (#B#), Hoffmann, No
10, p. 43, in which the stanzas have been uniformly extended to three
verses, to suit the air, which required the repetition of the second
line of the original stanza.

Heer Halewijn (#A#), like the English elf-knight, sang such a song that
those who heard it longed to be with him. A king's daughter asked her
father if she might go to Halewijn. No, he said; those who go that way
never come back [sixteen have lost their lives, #B#]. So said mother and
sister, but her brother's answer was, I care not where you go, so long
as you keep your honor. She dressed herself splendidly, took the best
horse from her father's stable, and rode to the wood, where she found
Halewijn waiting for her.[28] They then rode on further, till they came
to a gallows, on which many women were hanging. Halewijn says, Since you
are the fairest maid, choose your death [#B# 20 offers the choice
between hanging and the sword]. She calmly chooses the sword. "Only take
off your coat first, for a maid's blood spirts a great way, and it would
be a pity to spatter you." His head was off before his coat, but the
tongue still spake. This dialogue ensues:

    'Go yonder into the corn,
    And blow upon my horn,
    That all my friends you may warn.'

    'Into the corn I will not go,
    And on your horn I will not blow:
    A murderer's bidding I will not do.'

    'Go yonder under the gallows-tree,
    And fetch a pot of salve for me,
    And rub my red neck lustily.'

    'Under the gallows I will not go,
    Nor will I rub your red neck, no,
    A murderer's bidding I will not do.'

She takes the head by the hair and washes it in a spring, and rides back
through the wood. Half-way through she meets Halewijn's mother, who asks
after her son; and she tells her that he is gone hunting, that he will
never be seen again, that he is dead, and she has his head in her lap.
When she came to her father's gate, she blew the horn like any man.

    And when the father heard the strain,
    He was glad she had come back again.

    Thereupon they held a feast,
    The head was on the table placed.

Snellaert's copy and the modern three-line ballad have a meeting with
father, brother, sister, and mother successively. The maid's answer to
each of the first three is that Halewijn is amusing himself with sixteen
maids, or to that effect, but to the mother that he is dead, and she has
his head in her lap. The mother angrily replies, in #B#, that if she had
given this information earlier she would not have got so far on her way
home. The maid retorts, Wicked woman, you are lucky not to have been
served as your son; then rides, "like Judith wise," straight to her
father's palace, where she blows the horn blithely, and is received with
honor and love by the whole court.[29]

Another Flemish version (#C#) has been lately published under the title,
'Roland,' by which only, we are informed, is this particular form known
in Bruges and many parts of Flanders:[30] Chants populaires recueillis
[a'] Bruges par Adolphe Lootens et J. M. E. Feys, No 37, p. 60, 183 vv, in
sixty-three stanzas, of two, three, four, or five lines. This text dates
from the last century, and is given with the most exact fidelity to
tradition. It agrees with #A# as to some main points, but differs not a
little as to others. The story sets out thus:

    It was a bold Roland,
    He loved a lass from England;
    He wist not how to get her,
    With reading or with writing,
    With brawling or with fighting.


Roland has lost Halewyn's art of singing. Louise asks her father if she
may go to Roland, to the fair, as all her friends do. Her father
refuses: Roland is "een stoute kalant," a bad fellow that betrays pretty
maids; he stands with a drawn sword in his hand, and all his soldiers in
armor. The daughter says she has seen Roland more than once, and that
the tale about the drawn sword and soldiers is not true. This scene is
exactly repeated with mother and brother. Louise then tries her
shrift-father. He is easier, and does not care where she goes, provided
she keeps her honor and does not shame her parents. She tells father,
mother, and brother that she has leave from her confessor, makes her
toilet as in #A#, takes the finest horse in the stable, and rides to the
wood. There she successively meets Roland's father, mother, and brother,
each of whom asks her where she is going, and whether she has any right
to the crown she wears. To all she replies, Whether I have or not, be
off; I know you not. She does not encounter Roland in the wood, they do
not ride together, and there is no gallows-field. She enters Roland's
house, where he is lying abed. He bids her gather three rose-wreaths "at
his hands" and three at his feet; but when she approaches the foot of
the bed he rises, and offers her the choice to lose her honor or kneel
before the sword. She chooses the sword, advises him to spare his coat,
and, while he is taking it off, strikes off his head, all as in #A#. The
head speaks: Go under the gallows (of which we have heard nothing
hitherto), fetch a pot of salve, rub it on my wounds, and they shall
straight be well. She declines to follow a murderer's rede, or to learn
magic. The head bids her go under the blue stone and fetch a pot of
maidens-grease, which also will heal the wounds. This again she refuses
to do, in the same terms; then seizes the head by the hair, washes it in
a spring, and rides off with it through the wood, duly meeting Roland's
father, mother, and brother once more, all of whom challenge her, and to
all of whom she answers,

    Roland your son is long ago dead;
    God has his soul and I his head;
    For in my lap here I have his head,
    And with the blood my apron is red.

When she came back to the city the drums and the trumpets struck up.[31]
She stuck the head out of the window, and cried, "Now I am Roland's
bride!" She drew it in, and cried, "Now I am a heroine!"

#Danish.# Eleven versions of this ballad are known in Danish, seven of
which are given in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, No 183, 'Kvindemorderen,'
#A-G#. Four more, #H-L#, are furnished by Kristensen, Jydske Folkeviser,
I, Nos 46, 47, 91; II, No 85. #A#, in forty-one two-line stanzas
(previously printed in Grundtvig's Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p.
233), is from a 16th century MS.; #B#, thirty stanzas, #C#,
twenty-four, #D#, thirty-seven, from MSS of the 17th century; #E#,
fifty-seven, from a broadside of the end of the 18th; #F#, thirty, from
one of the beginning of the 19th; and #G-L#, thirty-five, twenty-three,
thirty-one, twenty-six, thirty-eight stanzas, from recent oral
tradition.

The four older versions, and also #E#, open with some lines that occur
at the beginning of other ballads.[32] In #A# and #E#, and, we may add,
#G#, the maid is allured by the promise of being taken to a paradise
exempt from death and sorrow; #C#, #D#, #F# promise a train of handmaids
and splendid presents. All the versions agree very well as to the kernel
of the story. A false knight prevails upon a lady to elope with him, and
they ride to a wood [they simply meet in a wood, #H#, #K#]. He sets to
work digging a grave, which she says is too long for his [her] dog and
too narrow for his [her] horse [all but #F#, #H#]. She is told that the
grave is for her. He has taken away the life [and honor, #B#, #C#, #I#]
of eight maids, and she shall be the ninth. The eight maids become nine
kings' daughters in #E#, ten in #F#, nineteen in #G#, and in #E# and #F#
the hard choice is offered of death by sword, tree, or stream. In #A#,
#E#, #I#, #L# the knight bids the lady get her gold together before she
sets out with him, and in #D#, #H#, #K#, #L# he points out a little
knoll under which he keeps the gold of his previous victims. The maid
now induces the knight to lie down with his head in her lap, professing
a fond desire to render him the most homely of services[33] [not in #C#,
#G#, #I#, #K#]. He makes an express condition in #E#, #F#, #G#, #H#, #L#
that she shall not betray him in his sleep, and she calls Heaven to
witness that she will not. In #G# she sings him to sleep. He slept a
sleep that was not sweet. She binds him hand and foot, then cries, Wake
up! I will not betray you in sleep.[34] Eight you have killed; yourself
shall be the ninth. Entreaties and fair promises and pretences that he
had been in jest, and desire for shrift, are in vain. Woman-fashion she
drew his sword, but man-fashion she cut him down. She went home a maid.

#E#, #F#, #G#, however, do not end so simply. On her way home through
the wood [#E#], she comes upon a maid who is working gold, and who says,
The last time I saw that horse my brother rode it. She answers, Your
brother is dead, and will do no more murdering for gold; then turns her
horse, and sets the sister's bower on fire. Next she encounters seven
robbers on the heath, who recognize the horse as their master's, and are
informed of his death and of the end of his crimes. They ask about the
fire. She says it is an old pig-sty. She rides on, and they call to her
that she is losing her horse's gold shoe. But nothing can stop her; she
bids them pick it up and drink it in wine; and so comes home to her
father's. #F# has nothing of the sister; in place of seven robbers there
are nine of the robber's brothers, and the maid sets their house on
fire. #G# indulges in absurd extravagances: the heroine meets the
robber's sister with twelve fierce dogs, and then his twelve swains, and
cuts down both dogs and swains.

The names in the Danish ballads are, #A#, Ulver and V[ae]nelil; #B#, Olmor,
or Oldemor, and Vindelraad; #C#, Hollemen and Vendelraad; #D#, Romor,
Reimord, or Reimvord, and the maid unnamed; #F#, Herr Peder and Liden
Kirsten; #H-L#, Ribold, Rigbold [#I#, Rimmelil] and Guldborg.

Four #Swedish# versions are known, all from tradition of this century.
#A#, 'Den Falske Riddaren,' twenty-three two-line stanzas, Arwidsson, 44
B, I, 301. #B#, 'R[:o]fvaren Brun,' fifteen stanzas, Afzelius, 83, III, 97.
#C#, twenty-seven stanzas, Arwidsson, 44 A, I, 298. #D#, 'R[:o]fvaren
Rymer,' sixteen stanzas, Afzelius, 82, III, 94. #A#, #B#, #D# have
resemblances, at the beginning, to the Ribold ballads, like the Danish
#A#, #B#, #E#, #G#, while the beginning of #C# is like the Danish #C#,
#D#, #F#. #A# has the grave-digging; there have been eight maids before;
the knight lays his head in the lady's lap for the same reason as in
most of the Danish ballads, and under the same assurance that he shall
not be betrayed in sleep; he is bound, and conscientiously waked before
his head is struck off; and the lady rides home to her father's. There
have been eight previous victims in #C#, and they king's daughters; in
#B#, eleven (maids); #D# says not how many, but, according to an
explanation of the woman that sang it, there were seven princesses. #C#,
#D#, like Danish #E#, #F#, #G#, make the maid encounter some of the
robber's family on the way home. By a misconception, as we perceive by
the Dutch ballad, she is represented as blowing the robber's horn. Seven
sisters come at the familiar sound to bury the murdered girl and share
the booty, but find that they have their brother to bury.

The woman has no name in any of the Swedish ballads. #A# calls the
robber "an outlandish man" (en man ifr[oa]n fremmande land), #B#, simple
Brun, #C#, a knight, and #D#, Riddaren Rymer, or Herr Rymer.

Of #Norwegian# versions, but two have been printed: #A#, 'Svein
Nor[dh]mann,' twenty two-line stanzas, Landstad, 69, p. 567; #B#,
'Rullemann og Hildeborg,' thirty stanzas, Landstad, 70, p. 571, both
from recent recitation. Bugge has communicated eight others to
Grundtvig. Both #A# and #B# have the paradise at the beginning, which is
found in Danish #A#, #E#, #G#, and Swedish #D#. In both the lady gets
her gold together while the swain is saddling his horse. They come to a
grave already dug, which in #B# is said to be made so very wide because
Rulleman has already laid nine maidens in it. The stanza in #A# which
should give the number is lost, but the reciter or singer put it at
seven or nine. The maid gets the robber into her power by the usual
artifice, with a slight variation in #B#. According to #A#, she rides
straight home to her father. #B#, like Danish #F#, has an encounter with
her false lover's [five] brothers. They ask, Where is Rullemann, thy
truelove? She answers, He is lying down, in the green mead, and bloody
is his bridal bed.

Of the unprinted versions obtained by Professor Bugge, two indicate that
the murderer's sleep was induced by a spell, as in English #A#. #F# 9
has,

    Long time stood Gullbj[:o]r; to herself she thought,
    May none of my _runes_ avail me ought?

And #H# 18, as also a variant to #B# 20, says it was a rune-slumber that
came over him. Only #G#, #H#, #I#, #K# give the number of the murdered
women: in #G#, #H#, eight, in #I#, nine, in #K#, five.

The names are, in #A#, Svein Nor[dh]mann and Gu[dh]bj[:o]rg; #B#,
Rulleman and Hildeborg [or Signe]; #C#, #D#, #E#, #F#, Svein N['o]rmann
and Gullbj[:o]r [Gunnbj[:o]r]; #G#, Rullemann and Kjersti; #H#,
Rullball and Signelill; #I#, Alemarken and Valer['o]s; #K#, Rulemann
and a fair maid.

Such information as has transpired concerning #Icelandic# versions of
this ballad is furnished by Grundtvig, IV, 4. The Icelandic form, though
curtailed and much injured, has shown tenacity enough to preserve itself
in a series of closely agreeing copies from the 17th century down. The
eldest, from a manuscript of 1665, runs thus:

    1
    ['A]sa went along the street, she heard a sweet sound.

    2
    ['A]sa went into the house, she saw the villain bound.

    3
    'Little ['A]sa, loose me! I will not beguile thee.'

    4
    'I dare not loose thee, I know not whether thou'lt beguile me.'

    5
    'God almighty take note who deceives the other!'

    6
    She loosed the bands from his hand, the fetter from his foot.

    7
    'Nine lands have I visited, ten women I've beguiled;

    8
    'Thou art now the eleventh, I'll not let thee slip.'

A copy, from the beginning of the 18th century, has, in stanza 2, "['A]sa
went into the _wood_," a recent copy, "over the fields;" and stanza 3,
in the former, with but slight differences in all the modern copies,
reads,

    'Welcome art thou, ['A]sa maid! thou wilt mean to loose me.'

Some recent copies (there is one in Berggreen, Danske Folkesange, 2d
ed., I, 162) allow the maid to escape, adding,

    9
    'Wait for me a little space, whilst I go into the green wood.'

    10
    He waited for her a long time, but she never came back to him.

    11
    ['A]sa took her white steed, of all women she rode most.

    12
    ['A]sa went into a holy cell, never did she harm to man.

This is certainly one of the most important of the #German# ballads,
and additions are constantly making to a large number of known
versions. Excepting two broadsides of about 1560, and two copies from
recitation printed in 1778, all these, twenty-six in number, have
been obtained from tradition since 1800.[35] They are as follows: #A

The German ballads, as Grundtvig has pointed out, divide into three
well-marked classes. The first class, embracing the versions #A-F# (6),
and coming nearest to English and Dutch tradition, has been found along
the lower half of the Rhine and in Westphalia, or in Northwest Germany;
the second, including #G-S# (13), is met with in Swabia, Switzerland,
Bohemia, Moravia, Styria, Carniola, or in South Germany; the third,
#T-Z# (7), in East Prussia, the eastern part of Brandenburg and of
Saxony, Silesia, and, again, Moravia, or, roughly speaking, in North and
East Germany; but, besides the Moravian, there is also of this third
class one version, in two copies, from the Rhine.

(I.) #A# runs thus. She that would ride out with Gert Olbert must dress
in silk and gold. When fair Helena had so attired herself, she called
from her window, Gert Olbert, come and fetch the bride. He took her by
her silken gown and swung her on behind him, and they rode three days
and nights. Helena then said, We must eat and drink; but Gert Olbert
said, We must go on further. They rode over the green heath, and Helena
once more tenderly asked for refreshment. Under yon fir [linden], said
Gert Olbert, and kept on till they came to a green spot, where nine
maids were hanging. Then it was, Wilt thou choose the fir-tree, the
running stream, or the naked sword? She chose the sword, but begged him
to take off his silken coat, "for a maid's blood spirts far, and I
should be sorry to spatter it." While he was engaged in drawing off his
coat, she cut off his head. But still the false tongue spoke. It bade
her blow in his horn; then she would have company enough. She was not so
simple as to do this. She rode three days and nights, and blew the horn
when she reached her father's castle. Then all the murderers came
running, like hounds after a hare. Frau Clara [Jutte] called out, Where
is my son? Under the fir-tree, sporting with nine maids; he meant me to
be the tenth, said Helena.

#B# is the same story told of a margrave and Fair Annie, but some
important early stanzas are lost, and the final ones have suffered
injury; for the ballad ends with this conceit, "She put the horn to her
mouth, and blew the margrave quite out of her heart." Here, by a
transference exceedingly common in tradition, it is the man, and not the
maid, that "would ride in velvet and silk and red gold."

#C a# has the names Odilia and Hilsinger, a trooper (reiter). Odilia was
early left an orphan, and as she grew up "she grew into the trooper's
bosom." He offered her seven pounds of gold to be his, and "she thought
seven pounds of gold a good thing." We now fall into the track of #A#.
Odilia dresses herself like a bride, and calls to the trooper to come
and get her. They ride first to a high hill, where she asks to eat and
drink, and then go on to a linden-tree, on which seven maids are
hanging. The choice of three deaths is offered, the sword chosen, he is
entreated to spare his coat, she seizes his sword and hews off his head.
The false tongue suggests blowing the horn. Odilia thinks "much biding
or blowing is not good." She rides away, and presently meets the
trooper's "little foot-page" (bot), who fancies she has Hilsinger's
horse and sword. "He sleeps," she says, "with seven maids, and thought I
was to be the eighth." This copy concludes with a manifestly spurious
stanza. #C b# agrees with #C a# for ten stanzas, as to the matter, and
so far seems to be #C a# improved by Zuccalmaglio, with such
substitutions as a princely castle for "seven pounds of gold." The last
stanza (11),

    Und als die Sternlein am Himmel klar,
    Ottilia die achte der Todten war,

was, no doubt, suggested by the last of #F#, another of Zuccalmaglio's
versions, and, if genuine, would belong to a ballad of the third class.

#D# has the name Odilia for the maid, but the knight, or trooper, has
become expressly a robber (ritter, reiter, r[:a]uber). They ride to a green
heath, where there is a cool spring. Odilia asks for and gets a draught
of water, and is told that at the linden-tree there will be eating and
drinking for them. And when they come to the linden, there hang six,
seven maids! All proceeds as before. The talking head is lost. Odilia
meets the robber's mother, and makes the usual reply.[37]

#E# resembles #C# closely. Odilia becomes Schondilg (Sch[:o]n Odilie),
R[:a]uber returns to Ritter, or Reiter, and the servant-maid bribe of seven
pounds of gold rises to ten tons.[38] Schondilg's toilet, preparatory to
going off (6-8), is described with a minuteness that we find only in the
Dutch ballad (12-16). After this, there is no important variation. She
meets the trooper's three brothers, and makes the same replies to them
as to the mother in #D#.

#F.# The personages here are Linnich (i.e., Nellie) and a knight from
England. The first twelve stanzas do not diverge from #C#, #D#, #E#. In
stanza 13 we find the knight directing the lady to strip off her silk
gown and gold necklace, as in the English #C#, #D#, #E#; but certainly
this inversion of the procedure which obtains in German #C#, #D#, #E# is
an accident arising from confused recollection. The 14th and last stanza
similarly misunderstands the maid's feigned anxiety about the knight's
fine coat, and brings the ballad to a false close, resembling the
termination of those of the third class, still more those of certain
mixed forms to be spoken of presently.

(II.) The second series, #G-S#, has three or four traits that are not
found in the foregoing ballads. #G#, which, as well as #H#, was in print
more than two hundred years before any other copy is known to have been
taken down, begins, like the Dutch Halewijn, with a knight (Ulinger)
singing so sweetly that a maid (Fridburg) is filled with desire to go
off with him. He promises to teach her his art. This magical song is
wanting only in #R#, of class II, and the promise to teach it only in
#Q#, #R#. She attires herself splendidly; he swings her on to his horse
behind him, and they ride to a wood. When they came to the wood there
was no one there but a white dove on a hazel-bush, that sang, Listen,
Fridburg: Ulinger has hanged eleven[39] maids; the twelfth is in his
clutches. Fridburg asked what the dove was saying. Ulinger replied, It
takes me for another; it lies in its red bill; and rode on till it
suited him to alight. He spread his cloak on the grass, and asked her to
sit down:

    Er sprach sie solt ihm lausen,
    Sein gelbes Haar zerzausen.[40]

Looking up into her eyes, he saw tears, and asked why she was weeping.
Was it for her sorry husband? Not for her sorry husband, she said. But
here some stanzas, which belong to another ballad,[41] have crept in,
and she is, with no reason, made to ride further on. She comes to a
lofty fir, and eleven maids hanging on it. She wrings her hands and
tears her hair, and implores Ulinger to let her be hanged in her clothes
as she is.

    'Ask me not that, Fridburg,' he said;
    'Ask me not that, thou good young maid;
    Thy scarlet mantle and kirtle black
    Will well become my young sister's back.'

Then she begs to be allowed three cries.

    'So much I may allow thee well,
    Thou art so deep within the dell;
    So deep within the dell we lie,
    No man can ever hear thy cry.'

She cries, "Help, Jesu!" "Help, Mary!" "Help, dear brother!"

    'For if thou come not straight,
    For my life 't will be too late!'

Her brother seems to hear his sister's voice "in every sense."

    He let his falcon fly,
    Rode off with hounds in full cry;
    With all the haste he could
    He sped to the dusky wood.

    'What dost thou here, my Ulinger?
    What dost thou here, my master dear?'
    'Twisting a withe, and that is all,
    To make a halter for my foal.'

    'Twisting a withe, and that is all,
    To make a halter for thy foal!
    I swear by my troth thus shall it be,
    Thyself shalt be the foal for me.'

    'Then this I beg, my Fridburger,
    Then this I beg, my master dear,
    That thou wilt let me hang
    In my clothes as now I stand.'

    'Ask me not that, thou Ulinger,
    Ask me not that, false perjurer;
    Thy scarlet mantle and jerkin black
    Will well become my scullion's back.'

    His shield before his breast he slung,
    Behind him his fair sister swung,
    And so he hied away
    Where his father's kingdom lay.

#H#, the nearly contemporaneous Augsburg broadside, differs from #G# in
only one important particular. The "reuter" is Adelger, the lady
unnamed. A stanza is lost between 6 and 7, which should contain the
warning of the dove, and so is Adelger's version of what the bird had
said. The important feature in #H#, not present in #G#, is that the halt
is made near a spring, about which blood is streaming, "der war mit blut
umbrunnenn." This adds a horror to this powerful scene which well suits
with it. When the maid begins to weep, Adelger asks whether her tears
are for her father's land, or because she dislikes him so much. It is
for neither reason, but because on yon fir she sees eleven maids
hanging. He confirms her fears:

    'Ah, thou fair young lady fine,
    O palsgravine, O empress mine,
    Adelger 's killed his eleven before,
    Thou 'lt be the twelfth, of that be sure.'[42]

The last two lines seem, by their form, to be the dove's warning that
has dropped out between stanzas 6 and 7. The maid's clothes in #H# are
destined to be the perquisite of Adelger's mother, and the brother says
that Adelger's are to go to his shield-bearer. The unhappy maid cries
but twice, to the Virgin and to her brother. When surprised by the
brother, Adelger feigns to be twisting a withe for his falcon.

#I# begins, like #G#, #H#, with the knight's seductive song. Instead of
the dove directly warning the maid, it upbraids the man: "Whither now,
thou Ollegehr?[43] Eight hast thou murdered already; and now for the
ninth!" The maid asks what the dove means, and is told to ride on, and
not mind the dove, who takes him for another man. There are eight maids
in the fir. The cries are to Jesus, Mary, and her brothers, one of whom
hastens to the rescue. He is struck with the beauty of his sister's
attire,--her velvet dress, her virginal crown, "which you shall wear
many a year yet." So saying, he draws his sword, and whips off his
"brother-in-law's" head, with this epicedium:

    'Lie there, thou head, and bleed,
    Thou never didst good deed.

    'Lie there, thou head, and rot,
    No man shall mourn thy lot.

    'No one shall ever be sorry for thee
    But the small birds on the greenwood tree.'[44]

In #J#, again, the knight comes riding through the reeds, and sings such
a song that Brown Annele, lying under the casement, exclaims, "Could I
but sing like him, I would give my troth and my honor!" There are, by
mistake, two[45] doves in stanza 4, that warn Annele not to be beguiled,
but this error is set right in the next stanza. When she asks what the
dove is cooing, the answer is, "It is cooing about its red foot; it went
barefoot all winter." We have here again, as in #H#, the spring in the
wood, "mit Blute umrunnen," and the lady asks again the meaning of the
bloody spring. The knight replies, in a stanza which seems both
corrupted and out of place, "This is where the eleven pure virgins
perished." Then follow the same incidents as in #G-I#. He says she must
hang with the eleven in the fir, and be queen over all. Her cries are
for her father, for Our Lady, and for her brother, who is a hunter in
the forest. The hunter makes all haste to his sister, twists a withe,
and hangs the knight without a word between them, then takes his sister
by the hand and conducts her home, with the advice never more to trust a
knight: for all which she returns her devout thanks.[46]

#K# and #L# are of the same length and the same tenor as #J#. There are
no names in #L#; in #K# both Annele and Ulrich, but the latter is very
likely to have been inserted by the editor. #K#, #L# have only one dove,
and in neither does the lady ask the meaning of the dove's song. The
knight simply says, "Be still; thou liest in thy throat!" Both have the
bloody spring, but out of place, for it is very improperly spoken of by
the knight as the spot he is making for:

    'Wir wollen ein wenig weiter vorw[:a]rts faren,
    Bis zu einem k[:u]hlen Waldbrunnen,
    Der ist mit Blut [:u]berronnen.'[47]

                              L 26-28, 17-19.

The three cries are for father, mother, brother. In #K# the brother
fights with "Ulrich" two hours and a half before he can master him, then
despatches him with his two-edged sword, and hangs him in a withe. He
fires his rifle in #L#, to announce his coming, and hears his sister's
laugh; then stabs the knight through the heart. The moral of #J# is
repeated in both: Stay at home, and trust no knight.

#M# smacks decidedly of the b[:a]nkels[:a]nger, and has an appropriate
moral at the tail: _animi index cauda!_ The characters are a cavalier
and a girl, both nameless, and a brother. The girl, hearing the knight
sing "ein Liedchen von dreierlei Stimmen," which should seem to
signify a three-part song, says, "Ah, could I sing like him, I would
straightway give him my honor." They ride to the wood, and come upon a
hazel-bush with _three_ doves, one of which informs the maid that she
will be betrayed, the second that she will die that day, and the third
that she will be buried in the wood. The second and third doves, as
being false prophets, and for other reasons, may safely be pronounced
intruders. All is now lost till we come to the cries, which are
addressed to father, mother, and brother. The brother stabs the traitor
to the heart.[48]

#N# is as short as #M#, and, like it, has no names, but has all the
principal points: the fascinating song, the dove on the bush, eleven
maids in the fir, the three cries, and the rescue by the
huntsman-brother, who cocks his gun and shoots the knight. The reciter
of this ballad gave the editor to understand that if the robber had
succeeded in his twelfth murder, he would have attained such powers that
nobody after that could harm him.[49]

#O# is a fairly well-preserved ballad, resembling #G-J# as to the course
of the story. Anneli, lying under the casement, hears the knight singing
as he rides through the reeds. The elaborate toilet is omitted, as in
#I#, #J#. The knight makes haste to the dark wood. They come to a cold
spring, "mit Bluot war er [:u]berrunnen;" then to a hazel, behind which a
dove coos ominously. Anneli says, Listen. The dove coos you are a false
man, that will not spare my life. No, says the knight, that is not it;
the dove is cooing about its blue foot, for its fate is to freeze in
winter. The cloak is thrown on the grass, the eleven maids in the fir
are descried, and Anneli is told she must hang highest, and be empress
over all. He concedes her as many cries as she likes, for only the
wood-birds will hear. She calls on God, the Virgin, and her brother. The
brother thinks he hears his sister's voice, calls to his groom to
saddle, comes upon the knight while he is twisting a withe for his
horse, as he says, ties him to the end of the withe, and makes him pay
for all he has perpetrated in the wood. He then swings Anneli behind
him, and rides home with her.

#P#, the other Swiss ballad, has been retouched, and more than
retouched in places, by a modern pen. Still the substance of the story,
and, on the whole, the popular tone, is preserved. Fair Anneli, in the
miller's house, hears the knight singing as he rides through the rushes,
and runs down-stairs and calls to him: she would go off with him if she
could sing like that, and her clothes are fit for any young lady. The
knight promises that he will teach her his song if she will go with him,
and bids her put these fine clothes on. They ride to the wood. A dove
calls from the hazel, "He will betray thee." Anneli asks what the dove
is saying, and is answered much as in #J# and #O#, that it is talking
about its frost-bitten feet and claws. The knight tears through the
wood, to the great peril of Anneli's gown and limbs, and when he has
come to the right place, spreads his cloak on the grass, and makes the
usual request. She weeps when she sees eleven maids in the fir-tree, and
receives the customary consolation:

    'Weep not too sore, my Anneli,
    'Tis true thou art doomed the twelfth to be;
    Up to the highest tip must thou go,
    And a margravine be to all below;
    Must be an empress over the rest,
    And hang the highest of all as the best.'

The request to be allowed three cries is lost. The knight tells her to
cry as much as she pleases, he knows no one will come; the wild birds
will not hear, and the doves are hushed. She cries to father, mother,
and brother. The brother, who is sitting over his wine at the inn,
hears, saddles his best horse, rides furiously, and comes first to a
spring filled with locks of maid's hair and red with maid's blood; then
to a bush, where the knight (R[:u]deli, Rudolph) is twisting his withe. He
bids his sister be silent, for the withe is not for her; the villain is
twisting it for his own neck, and shall be dragged at the tail of his
horse.

#Q# resembles the Swabian ballads, and presents only these variations
from the regular story. The dove adds to the warning, "Fair maid, be not
beguiled," what we find nowhere else, "Yonder I see a cool spring,
around which blood is running." The knight, to remove the maid's
anxiety, says, "Let it talk; it does not know me; I am no such
murderer." The end is excessively feeble. When the brother, a hunter as
before, reaches his sister, "a robber runs away," and then the brother
takes her by the hand, conducts her to her father's land, and enjoins
her to stay at home and spin silk. There are no names.

There is one feature entirely peculiar to #R#. The knight carries off
the maid, as before, but when they come to the hazel bush there are
eleven doves that sing this "new song:"

    'Be not beguiled, maiden,
    The knight is beguiling thee:

    'We are eleven already,
    Thou shalt be the twelfth.'

The eleven doves are of course the spirits of the eleven preceding
victims. The maid's inquiry as to what they mean is lost. The knight's
evasion is not ingenious, but more likely to allay suspicion than simply
saying, "I am no such murderer." He says, "Fear not: the doves are
singing a song that is common in these parts." When they come to the
spring "where blood and water are running," and the maid asks what
strange spring is this, the knight answers in the same way, and perhaps
could not do better: "Fear not: _there is_ in these parts a spring that
runs blood and water." This spring is misplaced, for it occurs before
they enter the wood. The last scene in the ballad is incomplete, and
goes no further than the brother's exclamation when he comes in upon the
knight: "Stop, young knight! Spare my sister's life." The parties in #R#
are nameless.

So again in #S#, which also has neither the knight's enchanting song nor
the bloody spring. There are two doves, as in #J#, stanza 4. The cries
are addressed to mother, father, brother, as in #N#, and, as in #N#,
again, the brother cocks his gun, and shoots the knight down;[50] then
calmly leads his sister home, with the warning against knights.

(III.) #T#, the first of the third series, has marked signs of
deterioration. Ulrich does not enchant [:A]nnchen by his song, and promise
to teach it to her; he offers to teach her "bird-song." They _walk_ out
together, apparently, and come to a hazel, with no dove; neither is
there any spring. Annie sits down on the grass; Ulrich lays his head in
her lap; she weeps, and he asks why. It is for eleven maids in the
fir-tree, as so often before. Ulrich's style has become much tamer:

    'Ah, Annie, Annie, dear to me,
    How soon shalt thou the twelfth one be!'

She begs for three cries, and calls to her father, to God, to her
youngest brother. The last is sitting over the wine and hears. He
demands of Ulrich where she is, and is told, Upon yon linden, spinning
silk. Then ensues this dialogue: Why are your shoes blood-red? Why not?
I have shot a dove. That dove my mother bare under her breast. Annie is
laid in the grave, and angels sing over her; Ulrich is broken on the
wheel, and round him the ravens cry.

There is no remnant or reminiscence of the magical singing in #U#. Sch[:o]n
Ulrich and Roth [:A]nnchen go on a walk, and come first to a fir-tree, then
a green mead. The next scene is exactly as in #T#. Ulrich says the
eleven maids were his wives, and that he had thrust his sword through
their hearts. Annie asks for three _sighs_, and directs them to God, to
Jesus, and to her youngest brother. He is sitting over his wine, when
the sigh comes into the window, and Ulrich simultaneously in at the
door. The remainder is very much as in #T#.

#V# differs from #U# only in the names, which are Sch[:o]n-Heinrich
and Sch[:o]n-[:A]nnelein, and in the "sighs" returning to cries, which
invoke God, father, and brother.

#W# begins with a rivalry between Ulrich and Hanselein[51] for the hand
of Rautendelein (Rautendchen). Ulrich is successful. She packs up her
jewels, and he takes her to a wood, where she sees eleven maids hanging.
He assures her she shall presently be the twelfth. It is then they sit
down, and she leans her head on his breast and weeps, "because," as she
says, "I must die." His remark upon this, if there was any, is lost.
Hoffmann inserts a stanza from another Silesian copy, in which Ulrich
says, Rather than spare thy life, I will run an iron stake through thee.
She asks for three cries, and he says, Four, if you want. She prefers
four, and calls to her father, mother, sister, brother. The brother, as
he sits over the wine, hears the cry, and almost instantly Ulrich comes
in at the door. He pretends to have killed a dove; the brother knows
what dove, and hews off Ulrich's head, with a speech like that in #I#.
Still, as Rautendchen is brought to the grave, with toll of bells, so
Ulrich is mounted on the wheel, where ravens shriek over him.

#X.# Albrecht and H[:a]nselein woo Alalein. She is promised to Albrecht,
but H[:a]nsel gets her. He takes her to a green mead, spreads his mantle on
the grass, and she sits down. His lying in her lap and her discovery of
the awful tree are lost. She weeps, and he tells her she shall be "his
eleventh." Her cries are condensed into one stanza:

    'Gott Vater, Sohn, Herr Jesu Christ,
    Mein j[:u]ngster Bruder, wo Du bist!'

Her brother rides in the direction of the voice, and meets H[:a]nselein in
the wood, who says Alalein is sitting with princes and counts. The
conclusion is as in #T#, #U#, #V#.

#Y# has Ansar Uleraich wooing a king's daughter, Annle, to the eighth
year. He takes her to a fir-wood, then to a fir, a stump of a tree, a
spring; in each case bidding her sit down. At the spring he asks her if
she wishes to be drowned, and, upon her saying no, cuts off her head.
He has not walked half a mile before he meets her brother. The brother
inquires where Ulrich has left his sister, and the reply is, "By the
green Rhine." The conclusion is as in #W#. Ulrich loses his head, and
the brother pronounces the imprecation which is found there and in
I.[52]

#Z#, which takes us back from Eastern Germany to the Rhine, combines
features from all the three groups. Ulrich fascinates a king's daughter
by his song. She collects her gold and jewels, as in #W#, and goes to a
wood, where a dove warns her that she will be betrayed. Ulrich
appropriates her valuables, and they wander about till they come to the
Rhine. There he takes her into a wood, and gives her a choice between
hanging and drowning, and, she declining both, says she shall die by his
sword. But first she is allowed three cries,--to God, her parents, her
youngest brother. The youngest brother demands of Ulrich where he has
left his sister. "Look in my pocket, and you shall find fourteen
tongues, and the last cut [reddest] of all is your sister's." The words
were scarcely out of his mouth before Ulrich's sword had taken off his
head.

The three classes of the German ballad, it will be observed, have for
their principal distinction that in I the maid saves her own life by an
artifice, and takes the life of her treacherous suitor; in II, she is
rescued by her brother, who also kills the traitor; in III, she dies by
the villain's hand, and he by her brother's, or by a public execution.
There are certain subordinate traits which are constant, or nearly so,
in each class. In I, #A-F#, a choice of deaths is invariably offered;
the maid gets the advantage of the murderer by persuading him to take
off his coat [distorted in #F#, which has lost its conclusion]; and, on
her way home, she falls in with one or more of the robber's family,
mother, brothers, servant, who interrogate her [except #F#, which, as
just said, is a fragment]. Class II has several marks of its own. All
the thirteen ballads [#G-S#], except the last, represent the knight as
fascinating the maid by his singing; in all but #Q# she is warned of her
danger by a dove,[53] or more than one; in all but the much-abridged
#M#, #N#, the knight spreads his cloak on the grass, they sit down, and,
excepting #M#, #N#, #R#, the unromantic service is repeated which she
undertakes in Danish #A#, #B#, #D#, #E#, #F#, #H#, #L#, Swedish #A#,
Norwegian #A#, #B#. The bloody spring occurs in some form, though often
not quite intelligible, in #H#, #J#, #K#, #L#, #O#, #P#, #Q#, #R# (also
in #D#, #Y#). All but the much-abridged #M#, #N# have the question, What
are you weeping for? your father's land, humbled pride, lost honor?
etc.; but this question recurs in #T#, #U#, #V#, #W#. The cries for help
are a feature of both the second and the third class, and are wanting
only in #Y#. Class III differs from I, and resembles II, in having the
cries for help, and, in the less impaired forms, #T-W#, the knight
spreads his cloak, lies down with his head in the lady's lap, and asks
the cause of her tears. Beyond this, and the changed catastrophe, the
ballads of Class III are distinguished by what they have lost.

Forms in which the story of this is mixed with that of some other German
ballad remain to be noticed.

#A.# A ballad first published in Nicolai's Almanach, II, 100, No 21
(1778), and since reprinted, under the titles, 'Liebe ohne Stand,' 'Der
Ritter und die K[:o]nigstochter,' etc., but never with absolute fidelity,
in Wunderhorn (1819), I, 37 (==Erlach, II, 120), Kretzschmer, No 72, I,
129; Mittler, No 89; Erk, Neue Sammlung, iii, 18, No 14; also, with a
few changes, by Zuccalmaglio, No. 95, p. 199, as 'aus Schwaben;' by Erk,
Liederhort, No 28, p. 90, as "corrected from oral tradition;" and as
"from oral tradition," in Erk's Wunderhorn (1857), I, 39. Independent
versions are given by Mittler, No 90, p. 83, from Oberhessen; Pr[:o]hle,
Weltliche u. geistliche Volkslieder, No 5, p. 10, from the Harz;
Reifferscheid, No 18, p. 36, from B[:o]kendorf. Erk refers to still another
copy, five stanzas longer than Nicolai's, from Hesse-Darmstadt, Neue
Sammlung, iii, 19, note.

What other ballad is here combined with Ulinger, it is impossible to
make out. The substance of the narrative is that a knight rides singing
through the reeds, and is heard by a king's daughter, who forthwith
desires to go with him. They ride till the horse is hungry [tired]; he
spreads his cloak on the grass, and makes, _sans fa[c,]on_, his usual
request. The king's daughter sheds many tears, and he asks why. "Had I
followed my father's counsel, I might have been empress." The knight
cuts off her head at the word, and says, Had you held your tongue, you
would have kept your head. He throws the body behind a tree, with Lie
there and rot; my young heart must mourn [no knight, a knight, shall
mourn over thee]. Another stanza or two, found in some versions, need
not be particularly noticed.

'Stolz Sieburg,' Simrock, No 8, p. 21, from the Rhine, Mittler, No 88,
is another and somewhat more rational form of the same story. To the
question whether she is weeping for Gut, Muth, Ehre, the king's daughter
answers:

    'Ich wein um meine Ehre,
    Ich wollt gern wieder umkehren.'

For this Stolz Sieburg strikes off her head, with a speech like that
which we have just had, and throws it into a spring; then resolves to
hang himself.[54]

A #Dutch# version of this ballad, Le Jeune, No 92, p. 292; Willems, No
72, p. 186; Hoffmann, No 29, p. 92, has less of the Halewyn in it, and
more motive than the German, though less romance. "If you might have
been an empress," says the knight, "I, a margrave's son, will marry you
to-morrow." "I would rather lose my head than be your wife," replies the
lady; upon which he cuts off her head and throws it into a fountain,
saying, Lie there, smiling mouth! Many a thousand pound have you cost
me, and many pence of red gold. Your head is clean cut off.

#B.# The Ulinger story is also found combined with that of the
beautiful ballad, 'Wassermanns Braut.'[55] (1.) In a Transylvanian
ballad, 'Brautm[:o]rder,' Schuster, Siebenb[:u]rgisch-s[:a]chsische
Volkslieder, p. 57, No 54 #A#, 38 vv, with variations, and p. 59, #B#,
a fragment of 10 vv; (#A# in a translation, B[:o]hme, No 14, p. 61.) A
king from the Rhine sues seven years for a king's daughter, and does
not prevail till the eighth. She begs her mother not to consent, for
she has seen it in the sun that she shall not long be her daughter, in
the moon that she shall drown before the year is out, in the bright
stars that her blood shall be dispersed far and wide. He takes her by
the hand, and leads her through a green wood, at the end of which a
grave is already made. He pushes her into the grave, and drives a stake
through her heart. The princess' brother asks what has become of his
sister. "I left her on the Rhine, drinking mead and wine." "Why are
your skirts so bloody?" "I have shot a turtle-dove." "That turtle-dove
was, mayhap, my sister." They spit him on a red-hot stake, and roast
him like a fish. Lines 1-4 of this ballad correspond to 1-4 of #Y#
(which last agree with 1-4 of Meinert's 'Wassermanns Braut'); 17, 18,
to #Y# 5, 6; 25-34 to 21-30; and we find in verse 22 the stake through
the heart which Hoffmann has interpolated in #W#, stanza 12.

(2.) A Silesian copy of 'Wassermanns Braut,' co[llecte]d by [Ho]ffman
contributed to Deutsches Museum, 1852, II, 164, represents the bride,
after she has fallen into the water and has been recovered by the nix,
as asking for three cries, and goes on from this point like the Ulrich
ballad #W#, the conclusion being that the sister is drowned before the
brother comes to her aid.[56]

'Nun sch[:u]rz dich, Gredlein,' "Forster's Frische Liedlein, No 66,"
B[:o]hme, No 53, Uhland, No 256 A, which is of the date 1549, and
therefore older than the Nuremberg and Augsburg broadsides, has derived
stanzas 7-9 from an Ulinger ballad, unless this passage is to be
regarded as common property. Some copies of the ballad commonly called
'M[:u]llert[:u]cke' have also adopted verses from Ulinger, especially
that in Meier's Schw[:a]bische Volkslieder, No 233, p. 403.

A form of ballad resembling English #C-F#, but with some important
differences, is extraordinarily diffused in #Poland#. There is also a
single version of the general type of English #A#, or, better, of the
first class of the German ballads. This version, #A#, Pauli,
Pie['s]['n]i ludu Polskiego w Galicyi, p. 90, No 5, and Kolberg,
Pie['s]ni ludu Polskiego, No 5, #bbb#, p. 70, runs thus. There was a man
who went about the world wiling away young girls from father and mother.
He had already done this with eight; he was now carrying off the ninth.
He took her to a frightful wood; then bade her look in the direction of
her house. She asked, "What is that white thing that I see on yon fir?"
"There are already eight of them," he said, "and you shall be the ninth;
never shall you go back to your father and mother. Take off that gown,
Maria." Maria was looking at his sword. "Don't touch, Maria, for you
will wound your pretty little hands." "Don't mind my hands, John," she
replied, "but rather see what a bold heart I have;" and instantly John's
head flew off. Then follows a single stanza, which seems to be addressed
to John's mother, after the manner of the German #A#, etc.: "See, dear
mother! I am thy daughter-in-law, who have just put that traitor out of
the world." There is a moral for conclusion, which is certainly a later
addition.

The other ballads may be arranged as follows, having regard chiefly to
the catastrophe. #B#, Kolberg, No 5, #oo#: #C#, #rr#: #D#, #ccc#: #E#,
#dd#: #F#, #uu#: #G#, #ww#: #H#, #t#: #I#, #u#: #J#, #gg#: #K#, #mm#:
#L#, Wac[/l]aw z Oleska, p. 483, 2, Kolberg, #p#: #L*#, Koz[/l]owski,
Lud, p. 33, No IV: #M#, Wojcicki, I, 234, Kolberg, #r#: #N#, Wojcicki,
I, 82, Kolberg, #s#: #O#, Kolberg, #d#: #P#, _ib._ #f#: #Q#, #pp#: #R#,
Wojcicki, I, 78, Kolberg, #e#: #S#, Kolberg, #l#: #T#, _ib._ #n#: #U#,
Pauli, Pje['s]['n]i ludu Polskiego w Galicyi, p. 92, No 6, Kolberg, #q#:
#V#, Kolberg, #y#: #W#, Wojcicki, II, 298, "J. Lipi['n]ski, Pie['s]ni
ludu Wielkopolskiego, p. 34," Kolberg, #ee#; #X#, Kolberg, #a#: #Y#,
_ib._ #z#: #Z#, #aa#: #AA#, #qq#: #BB#, #w#; #CC#, #ddd#: #DD#, #m#:
#EE#, #c#: #FF#, #o#: #GG#, [/l][/l]: #HH#, #ss#: #II#, #ii#: #JJ#,
#ff#: #KK#, #tt#: #LL#, #i#: #MM#, #g*#. In #B-K# the woman comes off
alive from her adventure: in #O-CC#, she loses her life: in #L-N# there
is a jumble of both conclusions: #DD-MM# are incomplete.[57]

The story of the larger part of these ballads, conveyed as briefly as
possible, is this: John, who is watering horses, urges Catherine,[58]
who is drawing water, to elope with him. He bids her take silver and
gold enough, that the horse may have something to carry. Catherine says
her mother will not allow her to enter the new chamber. Tell her that
you have a headache, says John, and she will consent. Catherine feigns a
headache, is put into the new chamber, and absconds with John while her
mother is asleep.[59] At a certain stage, more commonly at successive
stages,--on the high road, #K#, #P#, #S#, #DD#, #II#, #LL#, in a dark
wood, #D#, #P#, #T#, #X#, #Z#, #DD#, #EE#, at a spring, #D#, #K#, #S#,
#T#, #V#, #W#, #X#, #Y#, #Z#, #EE#, #II#, #LL#, etc.,--he bids her take
off, or himself takes from her, her "rich attire," #D#, #P#, #T#, #V#,
#W#, #X#, #Y#, #Z#, #DD#, #EE#, her satin gown, #D#, #T#, #X#, #DD#,
#EE#, her French or Turkish costume, #K#, #P#, #II#, robes of silver,
#K#, shoes, #Z#, #CC#, #FF#, silk stockings, #T#, corals, #D#, #X#,
#CC#, #EE#, pearls, #T#, rings, #K#, #O-T#, #X#, #Z#, #CC-FF#, #II#,
#LL#. In many of the ballads he tells her to go back to her mother,
#B-G#, #K#, #L*#, #M#, #N#, #Q#, #S#, #U#, #X#, #Y#, #EE#, #HH-LL#,
sometimes after pillaging her, sometimes without mention of this.
Catherine generally replies that she did not come away to have to go
back, #B#, #C#, #D#, #G#, #L*#, #M#, #S#, #U#, #X#, #Y#, #EE#, #HH#,
#JJ#, #KK#, #LL#. John seizes her by the hands and sides and throws her
into a deep river [pool, water, sea]. Her apron [tress, #AA#, #II#, both
apron and tress, #O#, petticoat, #KK#] is caught on a stake or stump of
a tree, #B#, #C#, #G#, #H#, #I#, #O#, #P#, #R#, #T#, #U#, #V#, #W#, #Y#,
#BB#, #DD#, #EE#, #II#, #JJ#, #KK# [in a bush #D#]. John cuts it away
with axe or sword, #G#, #I#, #O#, #R#, #T#, #BB#, #II#, #JJ#. She cries
to him for help. He replies, "I did not throw you in to help you
out,"[60] #B#, #C#, #F#, #P#, #U#, #V#, #W#, #X#, #Z#, #EE#, #II#.
Catherine is drawn ashore in a fisherman's net [swims ashore #I#, #J#,
#GG#].

Catherine comes out from the water alive in #B-N#. The brother who plays
so important a part in the second class of German ballads, appears also
in a few of the Polish versions, #B#, #C#, #D#, and #L*#, #O#, #P#, #Q#,
#X#, but is a mere shadow. In #B# 21, 22, and #C# 16, 17, the brother,
who is "on the mountain," and may be supposed to hear the girl's cry,
slides down a silken cord, which proves too short, and the girl "adds
her tress"! He asks the fishermen to throw their nets for her. She is
rescued, goes to church, takes an humble place behind the door, and,
when her eyes fall on the young girls, melts into tears. Her apron
catches in a bush in #D#: she plucks a leaf, and sends it down the
stream to her mother's house. The mother says to the father, "Do you not
see how Catherine is perishing?" The leaf is next sent down stream to
her sister's house, who says to her brother, "Do you not see how
Catherine is perishing?" He rides up a high mountain, and slides down
his silken cord. Though one or two stanzas are lost, or not given, the
termination was probably the same as in #B#, #C#. In #L*# 15, #O# 12,
the brother, on a high mountain, hears the cry for help, and slides down
to his sister on a silken cord, but does nothing. #X# does not account
for the brother's appearance: he informs the fishermen of what has
happened, and they draw Catherine out, evidently dead. The brother hears
the cry from the top of a wall in #P# 21, 22; slides down his cord; the
sister adds her tress; he directs the fishermen to draw her out; she is
dead. Instead of the brother on the wall, we have a mason in #Q# 27
[perhaps "the brother on the wall" in #P# _is_ a mason]. It is simply
said that "he added" a silken cord: the fishermen drew out Catherine
dead. The conclusion is equally, or more, impotent in all the versions
in which the girl escapes from drowning. In #G#, #I#, #J#, she seats
herself on a stone, and apostrophizes her hair, saying [in #G#, #I#],
"Dry, my locks, dry, for you have had much pleasure in the river!" She
goes to church, takes an humble place, and weeps, in #E#, #F#, #G#, as
in #B#, #C#, #D#. John goes scot-free in all these.[61] Not so in the
more vigorous ballads of tragic termination. Fierce pursuit is made for
him. He is cut to pieces, or torn to pieces, #O#, #P#, #S#, #T#, #Y#;
broken on the wheel, #L#, #U#, #V#, #W#; cleft in two, #BB#; broken
small as barley-corns, or quartered, by horses, #L*#, #Z#; committed to
a dungeon, to await, as we may hope, one of these penalties, #Q#, #R#.
The bells toll for Catherine [the organs play for her], and she is laid
in the grave, #O-W#, #Y#, #Z#, #L#, #L*#.

There are, besides, in various ballads of this second class, special
resemblances to other European forms. The man (to whom rank of any sort
is assigned only in #N#[62]) comes from a distant country, or from over
the border, in #O#, #Q#, #R#, #T#, #DD#, #GG#, as in English #D#, #E#.
The maid is at a window in #M#, #W#, as in German #G#, #J#, #M#, #O#,
#P#, #Q#, etc. In #Q# 2, John, who has come from over the border,
persuades the maid to go with him by telling her that in his country
"the mountains are golden, the mountains are of gold, the ways of silk,"
reminding us of the wonderland in Danish #A#, #E#, etc. After the pair
have stolen away, they go one hundred and thirty miles, #O#, #DD#, #FF#;
thrice nine miles, #Q#; nine and a half miles, #T#; cross one field and
another, #M#, #R#; travel all night, #GG#; and neither says a word to
the other. We shall find this trait further on in French #B#, #D#,
Italian #B#, #C#, #D#, #F#, #G#. The choice of deaths which we find in
German #A-F# appears in #J#. Here, after passing through a silent wood,
they arrive at the border of the (red) _sea_. She sits down on a stone,
he on a rotten tree. He asks, By which death will you die: by my right
hand, or by drowning in this _river_? They come to a dark wood in #AA#;
he seats himself on a beech-trunk, she near a stream. He asks, Will you
throw yourself into the river, or go home to your mother? So #H#, and
#R# nearly.[63] She prefers death to returning. Previous victims are
mentioned in #T#, #DD#, #HH#. When she calls from the river for help, he
answers, #T# 22, You fancy you are the only one there; six have gone
before, and you are the seventh: #HH# 16, Swim the river; go down to the
bottom; six maids are there already, and you shall be the seventh [four,
fifth]: #DD# 13, Swim, swim away, to the other side; there you will see
my seventh wife.[64]

Other Slavic forms of this ballad resemble more or less the third German
class. A #Wendish# version from Upper Lusatia, Haupt and Schmaler, Part
I, No I, p. 27, makes Hil[vz]i[vc]ka (Lizzie) go out before dawn to cut
grass. Ho[/l]dra[vs]k suddenly appears, and says she must pay him some
forfeit for trespassing in his wood. She has nothing but her sickle, her
silver finger-ring, and, when these are rejected, her wreath, and that,
she says, he shall not have if she dies for it. Ho[/l]dra[vs]k, who
avows that he has had a fancy for her seven years (cf. German #Y#, and
the Transylvanian mixed form #B#), gives her her choice, to be cut to
pieces by his sword, or trampled to death by his horse. Which way
pleases him, she says, only she begs for three cries. All three are for
her brothers. They ride round the wood twice, seeing nobody; the third
time Ho[/l]drak comes up to them. Then follows the dialogue about the
bloody sword and the dove. When asked where he has left
Hi[/l][vz]i[vc]ka, Ho[/l]dra[vs]k is silent. The elder brother seizes
him, the younger dispatches him with his sword.

Very similar is a #Bohemian# ballad, translated in Waldau's B[:o]hmische
Granaten, II, 25.[65] While Katie is cutting grass, early in the
morning, Indriasch presents himself, and demands some for his horse. She
says, You must dismount, if your horse is to have grass. "If I do, I
will take away your wreath." "Then God will not grant you his blessing."
He springs from his horse, and while he gives it grass with one hand
snatches at the wreath with the other. "Will you die, or surrender your
wreath?" Take my life, she says, but allow me three cries. Two cries
reached no human ear, but the third cry her mother heard, and called to
her sons to saddle, for Katie was calling in the wood, and was in
trouble. They rode over stock and stone, and came to a brook where
Indriasch was washing his hands. The same dialogue ensues as in the
Wendish ballad. The brothers hewed the murderer into fragments.

A #Servian# ballad has fainter but unmistakable traces of the same
tradition: Vuk, Srpske Narodne Pjesme, I, 282, No 385, ed. 1841;
translated by Goetze, Serbische V. L., p. 99, by Talvj, V. L. der
Serben, 2d ed., II, 172, by Kapper, Ges[:a]nge der Serben, II, 318. Mara is
warned by her mother not to dance with Thomas. She disobeys. Thomas,
while dancing, gives a sign to his servants to bring horses. The two
ride off, and when they come to the end of a field Thomas says, Seest
thou yon withered maple? There thou shalt hang, ravens eat out thine
eyes, eagles beat thee with their wings. Mara shrieks, Ah me! so be it
with every girl that does not take her mother's advice.[66]

#French.# This ballad is well known in France, and is generally found in
a form resembling the English; that is to say, the scene of the
attempted murder is the sea or a river (as in no other but the Polish),
and the lady delivers herself by an artifice. One French version nearly
approaches Polish #O-CC#.

#A.# 'Renauld et ses quatorze Femmes,' 44 vv, Paymaigre, Chants
populaires recueillis dans le pays messin, No 31, I, 140. Renauld
carried off the king's daughter. When they were gone half-way, she
called to him that she was dying of hunger (cf. German #A-F#). Eat your
hand, he answered, for you will never eat bread again. When they had
come to the middle of the wood, she called out that she was dying of
thirst. Drink your blood, he said, for you will never drink wine again.
When they came to the edge of the wood, he said, Do you see that river?
Fourteen dames have been drowned there, and you shall be the fifteenth.
When they came to the river-bank, he bade her put off her cloak, her
shift. It is not for knights, she said, to see ladies in such plight;
they should bandage their eyes with a handkerchief. This Renauld did,
and the fair one threw him into the river. He laid hold of a branch; she
cut it off with his sword (cf. the Polish ballad, where the catastrophe,
and consequently this act, is reversed). "What will they say if you go
back without your lover?" "I will tell them that I did for you what you
meant to do for me."[67] "Reach me your hand; I will marry you Sunday."

    "Marry, marry a fish, Renauld,
    The fourteen women down below."

#B.# 'De Dion et de la Fille du Roi,' from Auvergne, Amp[e']re,
Instructions, etc., 40 vv, p. 40, stanzas 15-24, the first fourteen
constituting another ballad.[68] The pair went five or six leagues
without exchanging a word; only the fair one said, I am so hungry I
could eat my fist. Eat it, replied Dion, for you never again will eat
bread. Then they went five or six leagues in silence, save that she
said, I am so thirsty I could drink my blood. "Drink it, for you never
will drink wine. Over there is a pond in which fifteen ladies have had a
bath, have drowned themselves, and you will make sixteen." Arrived at
the pond, he orders her to take off her clothes. She tells him to put
his sword under his feet, his cloak before his face, and turn to the
pond; and, when he has done so, pushes him in. Here are my keys! he
cries. "I don't want them; I will find locksmiths." "What will your
friends say?" "I will tell them I did by you as you would have done by
me."

#C.# 'Veux-tu venir, bell' Jeanneton,' 32 vv, from Poitou and Aun['i]s,
Bujeaud, II, 232. When they reach the water, the fair one asks for a
drink. The man says, incoherently enough, Before drinking of this white
wine I mean to drink your blood. The stanza that should tell how many
have been drowned before is lost. Jeanneton, having been ordered to
strip, pushes the "beau galant" into the sea, while, at her request, he
is pulling off her stockings. He catches at a branch; she cuts it off,
and will not hear to his entreaties.

#D.# 'En revenant de la jolie Rochelle,' twelve two-line stanzas,
Gagnon, Chansons populaires du Canada, p. 155. A cavalier meets three
fair maids, mounts the fairest behind him, and rides a hundred leagues
without speaking to her, at the end of which she asks to drink. He takes
her to a spring, but when there she does not care to drink. The rest of
the ballad is pointless, and shows that the original story has been
completely forgotten.

#E.# 'Belle, allons nous ['e]promener,' from the Lyonnais, 28 vv,
Champfleury, Chansons des Provinces, p. 172, is like #C#, but still more
defective. The pair go to walk by "la mer courante." There is no order
for the lady to strip: on the contrary, she cries, D['e]shabillez-moi,
d['e]chaussez-moi! and, while the man is drawing off her shoe, "la belle
avance un coup de pied, le beau galant tombe dans l'eau."

#F.# 'Allons, mie, nous promener,' 32 vv, Po['e]sies populaires de la
France, MS., III, fol. 84, No 16, is like #C#. The lady asks the man to
pull off her shoes before he kills her. The man clutches a branch; the
woman cuts it away.

#G.# 'Le Tra[^i]tre Noy['e],' Chants pop. du Velay et du Forez, Romania, X,
199, is like #E#, #F#.

#H.# 'La Fillette et le Chevalier,' Victor Smith, Chants pop. du Velay
et du Forez, Romania, X, 198, resembles the common Polish ballad. Pierre
rouses his love early in the morning, to take a ride with him. He mounts
her on his horse, and when they come to a lonesome wood bids her alight,
for it is the last of her days. He plunges his sword into her heart, and
throws her into a river. Her father and mother come searching for her,
and are informed of her fate by a shepherdess, who had witnessed the
murder. The youngest of her three brothers plunges into the water,
exclaiming, Who threw you in? An angel descends, and tells him it was
her lover. A less romantic version, described in a note, treats of a
valet who is tired of an amour with a servant-girl. He is judicially
condemned to be hanged _or_ burned.

'La Fille de Saint-Martin de l'Ile,' Bujeaud, II, 226, has the
conclusion of the third class of German ballads. A mother incites her
son to make away with his wife. He carries her off on his horse to a
wheat-field [wood], and kills her with sword and dagger. Returning, he
meets his wife's brother, who asks why his shoes are covered with blood.
He says he has been killing rabbits. The brother replies, I see by your
paleness that you have been killing my sister. So G['e]rard de Nerval, Les
Filles du Feu, [OE]uvres Com., V, 134, and La Boh[e']me galante (1866), p.
79: 'Rosine,' Chants pop. du Velay, etc., Romania, X, 197.

The ballad is known over all #North Italy#, and always nearly in one
shape.

#A.# 'Monchisa,' sixty-four short verses, Bernoni, Canti popolari
veneziani, Puntata v, No 2. A count's son asks Monchesa, a knight's
daughter, in marriage in the evening, espouses her in the morning, and
immediately carries her off. When they are "half-way," she heaves a
sigh, which she says is for father and mother, whom she shall no more
see. The count points out his castle; he has taken thirty-six maids
there, robbed them of their honor, and cut off their heads. "So will I
do with you when we are there." The lady says no word till she is asked
why she is silent; then requests the count to lend her his sword; she
wishes to cut a branch to shade her horse. The moment she gets the sword
in her hand, she plunges it into his heart; then throws the body into a
ditch. On her way back, she meets her brother, whom she tells that she
is looking after the assassins who have killed her husband. He fears it
was she; this she denies, but afterwards says she must go to Rome to
confess a great sin. There she obtains prompt absolution.

#B.# 'La Figlia del Conte,' Adolf Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, No 73,
#a#, 34 vv, #b#, 48 vv. Here it is the daughter of a count that marries
Malpreso, the son of a knight. He takes her to France immediately. She
goes sixty miles (#b#) without speaking. She confesses to her brother
what she has done.

#C.# Righi, Canti popolari veronesi, 58 vv, No 94*, p. 30. The count's
son marries Mampresa, a knight's daughter. For thirty-six miles she does
not speak; after five more she sighs. She denies to her brother having
killed her husband, but still says she must go to the pope to confess an
old sin; then owns what she has done.

#D.# 'La Monferrina,' 48 vv, Nigra, Canzoni popolari del Piemonte, in
Rivista Contemporanea, XXIV, 76. The lady is a Monferrina, daughter of a
knight. After the marriage they travel fifty miles without speaking to
one another. Fifty-two Monferrine have lost their heads; the bridegroom
does not say why. She goes to the Pope to confess.

#E.# 'La Vendicatrice,' an incomplete copy from Alexandria, 18 vv only,
Marcoaldi, Canti popolari, No 12, p. 166, like #D#, as far as it goes.
Thirty-three have been beheaded before.

#F.# 'La Inglese,' 40 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari di Ferrara, Cento e
Pontelagoscuro, No 2, p. 14. The count's son marries an English girl,
daughter of a knight. She never speaks for more than three hundred
miles; after two hundred more she sighs. She denies having killed her
husband; has not a heart of that kind.

#G.# 'La Liberatrice,' 24 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, No 3,
p. 4. Gianfleisa is the lady's name. When invited to go off, she says,
If you wish me to go, lend me a horse. Not a word is spoken for five
hundred miles. The man (Gilardu) points out his castle, and says that no
one he has taken there has ever come back. Gianfleisa goes home without
meeting anybody.

'Laura,' Ferraro, C. p. di Pontelagoscuro, Rivista di Filologia romanza,
II, 197, and C. p. di Ferrara, etc., p. 86, is a mixture of this ballad
with another. Cf. 'La Maledetta,' Ferraro, C. p. monferrini, No 27, p.
35.

Several other French and Italian ballads have common points with
Renauld, Monchisa, etc., and for this have sometimes been improperly
grouped with them: e.g., 'La Fille des Sables,' Bujeaud, II, 177 ff. A
girl sitting by the water-side hears a sailor sing, and asks him to
teach her the song. He says, Come aboard, and I will. He pushes off, and
by and by she begins to weep.[69] She says, My father is calling me to
supper. "You will sup with me." "My mother is calling me to bed." "You
will sleep with me." They go a hundred leagues, and not a word said, and
at last reach his father's castle. When she is undressing, her lace gets
into a knot. He suggests that his sword would cut it. She plunges the
sword into her heart. So 'Du Beau Marinier,' Beaurepaire, p. 57 f, and
Po['e]sies populaires de la France, MS., III, fol. 59, No 4; 'L'['E]p['e]e
Lib['e]ratrice,' V. Smith, Chansons du Velay, etc., Romania, VII, 69,
nearly; also 'Il Corsaro,' Nigra, Rivista Coutemporanea, XXIV, p. 86 ff.
In 'La Monferrina Incontaminata,' Ferraro, C. p. m., No 2, p. 3, a
French knight invites a girl to go off with him, and mounts her behind
him. They ride five hundred miles without speaking, then reach an inn,
after which the story is the same. So Bernoni, Puntata IX, No 2. 'La
Fille du Patissier,' Paymaigre, No 30, p. 93, has the same conclusion.
All these, except 'La Fille des Sables,' make the girl ask for the sword
herself, and in all it is herself that she kills.

The #Spanish# preserves this ballad in a single form, the earliest
printed in any language, preceding, by a few years, even the German
broadsides #G#, #H#.

'Romance de Rico Franco,' 36 vv, "Cancionero de Romances, s. a., fol.
191: Canc. de Rom., ed. de 1550, fol. 202: ed. de 1555, fol. 296;" Wolf
and Hofmann, Primavera, No 119, II, 22: Duran, No 296, I, 160: Grimm, p.
252: Depping and Galiano, 1844, II, 167: Ochoa, p. 7. The king's
huntsmen got no game, and lost the falcons. They betook themselves to
the castle of Maynes, where was a beautiful damsel, sought by seven
counts and three kings. Rico Franco of Aragon carried her off by force.
Nothing is said of a rest in a wood, or elsewhere; but that something
has dropped out here is shown by the corresponding Portuguese ballad.
The lady wept. Rico Franco comforted her thus: If you are weeping for
father and mother, you shall never see them more; and if for your
brothers, I have killed them all three. I am not weeping for them, she
said, but because I know not what my fate is to be. Lend me your knife
to cut the fringes from my mantle, for they are no longer fit to wear.
This Rico Franco did, and the damsel thrust the knife into his breast.
Thus she avenged father, mother, and brothers.

A #Portuguese# ballad has recently been obtained from tradition in the
island of St. George, Azores, which resembles the Spanish closely, but
is even curter: #A#, 'Romance de Dom Franco,' 30 vv; #B#, 'Dona Inez,' a
fragment of 18 vv; Braga, Cantos populares do Archipelago a[c,]oriano, No
48, p. 316, No 49, p. 317: Hartung's Romanceiro, II, 61, 63. Dona Inez
was so precious in the eyes of her parents that they gave her neither to
duke nor marquis. A knight who was passing [the Duke of Turkey, #B#]
took a fancy to her, and stole her away. When they came to the middle of
the mountain ridge on which Dona Inez lived, the knight stopped to rest,
and she began to weep. From this point Portuguese #A#, and #B# so far as
it is preserved, agree very nearly with the Spanish.[70]

Certain Breton ballads have points of contact with the Halewyn-Ulinger
class, but, like the French and Italian ballads mentioned on the
preceding page, have more important divergences, and especially the
characteristic distinction that the woman kills herself to preserve her
honor. 1. 'Jeanne Le Roux,' Luzel, I, 324 ff, in two versions; Po['e]sies
pop. de la France, MS., III, fol. 182. The sieur La Tremblaie attempts
the abduction of Jeanne from the church immediately after her marriage
ceremony. As he is about to compel her to get up on the crupper of his
horse, she asks for a knife to cut her bridal girdle, which had been
drawn too tight. He gives her the choice of three, and she stabs herself
in the heart. La Tremblaie _remarks_, I have carried off eighteen young
brides, and Jeanne is the nineteenth, words evidently taken from the
mouth of a Halewyn, and not belonging here. 2. Le Marquis de Coatredrez,
Luzel, I, 336 ff, meets a young girl on the road, going to the pardon of
Gu['e]odet, and forces her on to his horse. On the way and at his house she
vainly implores help. He takes her to the garden to gather flowers. She
asks for his knife to shorten the stems, and kills herself. Early in the
morning the door of the ch[^a]teau is broken in by Kerninon, foster-brother
of the victim, who forces Coatredrez to fight, and runs him through. 3.
'Rozmelchon,' Luzel, I, 308 ff, in three versions, and, 4, 'La Filleule
de du Guesclin,' Villemarqu['e], Barzaz-Breiz, 6th ed., 212 ff, are very
like 2. The wicked Rozmelchon is burned in his ch[^a]teau in Luzel's first
copy; the other two do not bring him to punishment. Villemarqu['e]'s
villain is an Englishman, and has his head cloven by du Guesclin. 5.
'Marivonnic,' Luzel, I, 350 ff, a pretty young girl, is carried off by
an English vessel, the captain of which shows himself not a whit behind
the feudal seigneurs in ferocity. The young girl throws herself into the
water.

#Magyar.# Five versions from recent traditions, all of them interesting,
are given in Arany and Gyulai's collection of Hungarian popular poetry,
'Moln['a]r Anna,' I, 137 ff, Nos 1-5.[71]--#A#, p. 141, No 3. A man,
nameless here, but called in the other versions Martin Ajg['o], or Martin
Sajg['o], invites Anna Miller to go off with him. She refuses; she has a
young child and a kind husband. "Come," he says; "I have six palaces,
and will put you in the seventh," and persists so long that he prevails
at last. They went a long way, till they came to the middle of a green
wood. He asked her to sit down in the shade of a branchy tree (so all);
he would lie in her lap, and she was to look into his head (a point
found in all the copies). But look not up into the tree, he said. He
went to sleep (so #B#, #D#); she looked up into the tree, and saw six
fair maids hanging there (so all but #E#). She thought to herself, He
will make me the seventh! (also #B#, #D#). A tear fell on the face of
the "brave sir," and waked him. You have looked up into the tree, he
said. "No, but three orphans passed, and I thought of my child." He bade
her go up into the tree. She was not used to go first, she said. He led
the way. She seized the opportunity, tore his sword from its sheath (so
=C#), and hewed off his head. She then wrapped herself in his cloak,
sprang upon his horse, and returned home, where (in all the copies, as
in this) she effected a reconcilement with her husband. #B#, p. 138, No
2, agrees closely with the foregoing. Martin Ajg['o] calls to Anna Miller
to come with him a long way into the wilderness (so #D#, #E#). He boasts
of no palaces in this version. He calls Anna a long time, tempts her a
long time, drags her on to his horse, and carries her off. The scene
under the tree is repeated. Anna pretends (so #D#, #E#) that the tear
which drops on Martin's face is dew from the tree, and he retorts, How
can it be dew from the tree, when the time is high noon? His sword falls
out of its sheath as he is mounting the tree, and he asks her to hand it
to him. She throws it up (so #E#), and it cuts his throat in two.
Rightly served, Martin Ajg['o], she says: why did you lure me from home?
#C#, p. 144, No 4. Martin Sajg['o] tells Anna Miller that he has six stone
castles, and is building a seventh. It is not said that he goes to
sleep. As in #A#, Anna pulls his sword from the scabbard. #D#, p. 146,
No 5. Here reappears the very important feature of the wonderland:
"Come, let us go, Anna Miller, a long journey into the wilderness, to a
place that flows with milk and honey." Anna insists, as before, that
Martin shall go up the tree first. He puts down his sword; she seizes
it, and strikes off his head with one blow. #E#, p. 137, No 1, is
somewhat defective, but agrees essentially with the others. Martin Ajg['o]
calls Anna; she will not come; he carries her off. He lets his sword
fall as he is climbing, and asks Anna to hand it up to him. She throws
it up, as in #B#, and it cuts his back in two.

Neus, in his Ehstnische Volkslieder, maintains the affinity of
'Kallewisohnes Tod,' No 2, p. 5, with the Ulinger ballads, and even of
his Holepi with the Dutch Halewyn. The resemblance is of the most
distant, and what there is must be regarded as casual. The same of the
Finnish 'Kojoins Sohn,' Schr[:o]ter, Finnische Runen, p. 114, 115; 'Kojosen
Poika,' L[:o]nnrot, Kanteletar, p. 279.

In places where a ballad has once been known, the story will often be
remembered after the verses have been wholly or partly forgotten, and
the ballad will be resolved into a prose tale, retaining, perhaps, some
scraps of verse, and not infrequently taking up new matter, or blending
with other traditions. Naturally enough, a ballad and an equivalent tale
sometimes exist side by side. It has already been mentioned that
Jamieson, who had not found this ballad in Scotland, had often come upon
the story in the form of a tale interspersed with verse. Birlinger at
one time (1860) had not been able to obtain the ballad in the Swabian
Oberland (where it has since been found in several forms), but only a
story agreeing essentially with the second class of German ballads.
According to this tradition, a robber, who was at the same time a
portentous magician, enticed the twelve daughters of a miller, one after
another, into a wood, and hanged eleven of them on a tree, but was
arrested by a hunter, the brother of the twelve, before he could
dispatch the last, and was handed over to justice. The object of the
murders was to obtain blood for magical purposes. This story had, so to
speak, naturalized itself in the locality, and the place where the
robber's house had been and that where the tree had stood were pointed
out. The hunter-brother was by some conceived of as the Wild Huntsman,
and came to the rescue through the air with a fearful baying of dogs.
(Birlinger in Volksth[:u]mliches aus Schwaben, I, 368, No 592, and
Germania, 1st Ser., V, 372.)

The story of the German ballad #P# has attached itself to localities in
the neighborhood of Weissenbach, Aargau, and is told with modifications
that connect it with the history of the Guggi-, or Schongauer-, bad. A
rich man by lewd living had become a leper. The devil put it into his
head that he could be cured by bathing in the blood of twelve [seven]
pure maidens. He seized eleven at a swoop, while they were on their way
to church, and hanged them, and the next day enticed away a miller's
daughter, who was delivered from death as in the ballad. A medicinal
spring rose near the fatal tree. (Rochholz, I, 22.) No pure version of
this ballad has been obtained in the Harz region, though a mixed form
has already been spoken of; but 'Der Reiter in Seiden,' Pr[:o]hle,
M[:a]rchen f[:u]r die Jugend, No 32, p. 136, which comes from the
western Harz, or from some place further north, on the line between
Kyffha[:u]ser and Hamburg, is, roughly speaking, only 'Gert Olbert'
turned into prose, with a verse or two remaining. 'Der betrogene
Betr[:u]ger,' from M[:u]hlbach, M[:u]ller's Siebenb[:u]rgische Sagen,
No 418, p. 309, has for its hero a handsome young man, addicted to
women, who obtains from the devil the power of making them follow his
piping, on the terms that every twelfth soul is to be the devil's
share. He had taken eleven to a wood, and hanged them on a tree after
he had satisfied his desire. The brother of a twelfth substituted
himself for his sister, dressed in her clothes, snatched the rope
from the miscreant, and ran him up on the nearest bough; upon which
a voice was heard in the wind, that cried The twelfth soul is mine.
Grundtvig, in his Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p. 249, gives his
recollections of a story that he had heard in his youth which has a
catastrophe resembling that of English #C-F#. A charcoal burner had a
way of taking up women beside him on his wagon, and driving them into a
wood, where he forced them to take off their clothes, then killed them,
and sunk them with heavy stones in a deep moss. At last a girl whom he
had carried off in this way got the advantage of him by inducing him
to turn away while she was undressing, and then pushing him into the
moss. Something similar is found in the conclusion of a robber story in
Grundtvig's Danske Folkeminder, 1861, No 30, p. 108, and in a modern
Danish ballad cited in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, IV, 24, note.**

Another Transylvanian tale, Schuster, p. 433, has a fountain, a thirsty
bride, and doves (two or three) that sing to her, traits which have
perhaps been derived from some Ulinger ballad; but the fountain is
of an entirely different character, and the doves serve a different
purpose. The tale is a variety of 'Fitchers Vogel,' Grimms, No 46,
and belongs to the class of stories to which 'Bluebeard,' from its
extensive popularity, has given name. The magician of 'Fitcher's
Vogel' and of 'Bluebeard' becomes, or remains, a preternatural being
(a hill-man) further north, as in Grundtvig's Gamle danske Minder,
1857, No 312, p. 182. There is a manifest affinity between these three
species of tales and our ballad (also between the German and Danish
tales and the Scandinavian ballad of 'Rosmer'), but the precise nature
of this affinity it is impossible to expound. 'Bluebeard,' 'La Barbe
Bleue,' Perrault, Histoires ou Contes du temps pass['e], 1697, p. 57
(Lef[e']vre), has a special resemblance to the German ballads of the
second class in the four calls to sister Anne, which represent the
cries to father, mother, and brother, and agrees with these ballads as
to the means by which the death of the malefactor is brought about.

Looking back now over the whole field covered by this ballad, we observe
that the framework of the story is essentially the same in English,
Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian; in the first class of the German
ballads; in Polish #A#; in French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Magyar. The woman delivers herself from death by some artifice,[72] and
retaliates upon the man the destruction he had intended for her. The
second form of the German ballad attributes the deliverance of the woman
to her brother, and also the punishment of the murderer. The third form
of the German ballad makes the woman lose her life, and her murderer,
for the most part, to suffer the penalty of the law, though in some
cases the brother takes immediate vengeance. Polish #B-K# may be ranked
with the second German class, and #O-CC# still better with the third;
but the brother appears in only a few of these, and, when he appears,
counts for nothing. The Wendish and the Bohemian ballad have the
incident of fraternal vengeance, though otherwise less like the German.
The Servian ballad, a slight thing at best, is still less like, but
ranks with the third German class. The oldest Icelandic copy is
altogether anomalous, and also incomplete, but seems to imply the death
of the woman: later copies suffer the woman to escape, without vengeance
upon the murderer.

It is quite beyond question that the third class of German ballad is a
derivation from the second.[73] Of the versions #T-Z#, #Z# alone has
preserved clear traits of the marvellous. A king's daughter is enticed
from home by Ulrich's singing, and is warned of her impending fate by
the dove, as in Class II. The other ballads have the usual marks of
degeneracy, a dropping or obscuring of marvellous and romantic
incidents, and a declension in the rank and style of the characters.
#T#, to be sure, has a hazel, and #Y# a tree-stump and a spring, and in
#T# Ulrich offers to teach [:A]nnchen bird-song, but these traits have lost
all significance. Knight and lady sink to ordinary man and maid; for
though in #Y# the woman is called a king's daughter, the opening stanzas
of #Y# are borrowed from a different ballad. Ulrich retains so much of
the knight that he rides to [:A]nnchen's house, in the first stanza of #T#,
but he apparently goes on foot with her to the wood, and this is the
rule in all the other ballads of this class. As Ulrich has lost his
horse, so the brother, in #T#, #U#, #V#, #X#, has lost his sword, or the
use of it, and in all these (also, superfluously, in #W#) Ulrich, like a
common felon as he was, is broken on the wheel.

That the woman should save her life by her own craft and courage is
certainly a more primitive conception than that she should depend upon
her brother, and the priority of this arrangement of the plot is
supported, if not independently proved, by the concurrence, as to this
point, of so many copies among so many nations, as also by the
accordance of various popular tales. The second German form must
therefore, so far forth, be regarded as a modification of the first.
Among the several devices, again, which the woman employs in order to
get the murderer into her power, the original would seem to be her
inducing him to lay his head in her lap, which gives her the opportunity
(by the use of charms or runes, in English #A#, Danish #G#, Norwegian
#F#, #H#, and one form of #B#) to put him into a deep sleep. The success
of this trick no doubt implies considerable simplicity on the part of
the victim of it; not more, however, than is elsewhere witnessed in
preternatural beings, whose wits are frequently represented as no match
for human shrewdness. Some of the Scandinavian ballads are not liable to
the full force of this objection, whatever that may be, for they make
the knight express a suspicion of treachery, and the lady solemnly
asseverate that she will not kill [fool, beguile] him in his sleep. And
so, when he is fast bound, she cries out, Wake up, for I will not kill
thee _in thy sleep_! This last circumstance is wanting in hardly any of
the Scandinavian ballads, whereas the previous compact is found only in
Danish #E#, #F#, #G#, #H#, #L#, Swedish #A#, Norwegian #A#, and the
Icelandic ballad. Not occurring in any of the older Danish copies, it
may be that the compact is an after-thought, and was inserted to
qualify the improbability. But the lady's equivocation is quite of a
piece with Memering's oath in 'Ravengaard and Memering,' Grundtvig, No
13, and King Dietrich's in the Dietrichsaga, Unger, c. 222, p. 206.[74]

English #A# and all the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian ballads employ
the stratagem of lulling the man to sleep, but these are not the only
ballads in which the man lays his head in the woman's lap. This trait is
observed in nearly all German ballads of the second and third class, in
_all_ the well-preserved ones, and also in the Magyar ballad. With
regard to the German ballads, however, it is purposeless (for it does
not advance the action of the drama in the least), and must be regarded
as a relic of an earlier form.[75] English #B-F# and all the French
ballads dispose of the traitor by a watery death. The scene is shifted
from a wood to a sea-coast, pool, or river bank, perhaps to suit the
locality to which the ballad had wandered. In English #B#, where,
apparently under the influence of other ballads,[76] the lady is forced
to wade into water up to her chin, the knight is pushed off his horse
when bending over to give a last kiss for which he had been asked; in
English #C-F# and French #A#, #B#, the man is induced to turn his face
to save the woman's modesty; in French #C-E# he is made to pull off her
stockings or shoes, and then, while off his guard, pitched into a sea or
river. This expedient is sufficiently trivial; but still more so, and
grazing on the farcical, is that which is made use of in the Dutch
ballad and those of the German first class, the woman's persuading the
man to take off his fine coat lest it should be spattered with her
blood, and cutting off his head with his own sword while he is thus
occupied. The Spanish and Portuguese ballads make the lady borrow the
knight's knife to remove some of the trimming of her dress, and in the
Italian she borrows his sword to cut a bough to shade her horse; for in
Italian the halt in the wood is completely forgotten, and the last half
of the action takes place on horseback. All these contrivances plainly
have less claim to be regarded as primary than that of binding the
murderer after he has been put to sleep.

The knight in English #A# is called an Elf, and as such is furnished
with an enchanting horn, which is replaced by a harp of similar
properties in #B#, where, however, the male personage has neither name
nor any kind of designation. The elf-horn of English #A# is again
represented by the seductive song of the Dutch ballad and of German
#G-R# and #Z#. Though the lady is not lured away in the Scandinavian
ballads by irresistible music,[77] Danish #A#, #E#, Norwegian #A#, #B#,
and Swedish #D# present to her the prospect of being taken to an
elf-land, or elysium, and there are traces of this in Danish #G# and #D#
also, and in Polish #Q#. The tongue that talks after the head is off, in
the Dutch ballad and in German #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, is another mark of an
unearthly being. Halewyn, Ulver, Gert Olbert, like the English knight,
are clearly supernatural, though of a nondescript type. The elf in
English #A# is not to be interpreted too strictly, for the specific elf
is not of a sanguinary turn, as these so conspicuously are. He is
comparatively innocuous, like the hill-man Young Akin, in another
English ballad, who likewise entices away a woman by magical music, but
only to make her his wife. But the elf-knight and the rest seem to
delight in bloodshed for its own sake; for, as Grundtvig has pointed
out, there is no other apparent motive for murder in English #A#, #B#,
the Norwegian ballads, Danish #A#, Swedish #A#, #B#, or German
#A-E#.[78] This is true again, for one reason or another, of others of
the German ballads, of the French, of most of the Italian, and of the
Hungarian ballads.

The nearest approach to the Elf-knight, Halewyn, etc., is perhaps
Quintalin, in the saga of Samson the Fair. He was son of the miller
Galin. Nobody knew who his mother was, but many were of the mind that
Galin might have had him of a "goddess," an elf or troll woman, who
lived under the mill force. He was a thief, and lay in the woods; was
versed in many knave's tricks, and had also acquired agreeable arts. He
was a great master of the harp, and would decoy women into the woods
with his playing, keep them as long as he liked, and send them home
pregnant to their fathers or husbands. A king's daughter, Valentina, is
drawn on by his music deep into the woods, but is rescued by a friendly
power. Some parts of her dress and ornaments, which she had laid off in
her rapid following up of the harping, are afterwards found, with a
great quantity of precious things, in the subaqueous cave of Quintalin's
mother, who is a complete counterpart to Grendel's, and was probably
borrowed from Be['o]wulf.[79] This demi-elf Quintalin is a tame personage
by the side of Grendel or of Halewyn. Halewyn does not devour his
victims, like Grendel: Quintalin does not even murder his. He allures
women with his music to make them serve his lust. We may infer that he
would plunder them, for he is a notorious thief. Even two of the oldest
Danish ballads, #B#, #C#, and again Danish #I# and Swedish #C#, make the
treacherous knight as lecherous as bloody, and so with German #J#, #K#,
#L#, #O#, #P#, #Q#, #R#, #S#, and Italian #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, #F#. This
trait is wanting in Danish #D#, where, though traces of the originally
demonic nature of the knight remain, the muckle gold of the maids
already appears as the motive for the murders. In the later Danish
#E-H#, #K#, #L#, and Swedish #C#, #D#, the original elf or demon has
sunk to a remorseless robber, generally with brothers, sisters, or
underlings for accomplices.[80] This is pre[:e]minently his character in
English #C-F#, in nearly all the forty Polish ballads, and in the two
principal ballads of the German second class, #G#, #H#, though English
#D#, German #H#, and Polish #Q# retain a trace of the supernatural: the
first in the charm by means of which the knight compels the maid to quit
her parents, the second in the bloody spring, and the last in the golden
mountains. There is nothing that unequivocally marks the robber in the
other German ballads of the second class and in those of the third. The
question 'Weinst du um deines Vaters Gut?' in #I-L#, #O-S#, #T-W#, is
hardly decisive, and only in #W# and #Z# is it expressly said that the
maid had taken valuable things with her (as in Swedish #D#, Norwegian
#A#, #B#, English #D-F#). #J-L#, #O-S#, give us to understand that the
lady had lost her honor,[81] but in all the rest, except the anomalous
#Z#, the motive for murder is insufficient.[82]

The woman in these ballads is for the most part nameless, or bears a
stock name to which no importance can be attached. Not so with the names
of the knight. Most of these are peculiar, and the Northern ones,
though superficially of some variety, have yet likeness enough to tempt
one to seek for a common original. Grundtvig, with considerable
diffidence, suggests Oldemor as a possible ground-form. He conceives
that the #R# of some of the Scandinavian names may be a relic of a
foregoing Herr. The initial #H# would easily come or go. Given such a
name as Hollemen (Danish #C#), we might expect it to give place to
Halewyn, which is both a family and a local name in Flanders, if the
ballad should pass into the Low Countries from Denmark, a derivation
that Grundtvig is far from asserting. So Ulinger, a local appellation,
might be substituted for the Ulver of Danish #A#. Grundtvig, it must be
borne in mind, declines to be responsible for the historical correctness
of this genealogy, and would be still less willing to undertake an
explanation of the name Oldemor.

In place of Oldemor, Professor Sophus Bugge, in a recent article, marked
by his characteristic sharp-sightedness and ingenuity, has proposed
Hollevern, Holevern, or Olevern as the base-form of all the Northern
names for the bloody knight, and he finds in this name a main support
for the entirely novel and somewhat startling hypothesis that the ballad
we are dealing with is a wild shoot from the story of Judith and
Holofernes.[83] His argument, given as briefly as possible, is as
follows.

That the Bible story was generally known in the Middle Ages no one would
question. It was treated in a literary way by an Anglo-Saxon poet, who
was acquainted with the scriptural narrative, and in a popular way by
poets who had no direct acquaintance with the original.[84] The source
of the story in the ballad must in any case be a tradition many times
removed from the biblical story; that much should be changed, much
dropped, and much added is only what would be expected.

Beginning the comparison with 'Judith' with this caution, it is first
submitted that Holofernes can be recognized in most of the Scandinavian
and German names of the knight. The v of the proposed base-form is
preserved in Ulver, Halewyn, and probably in the English Elf-knight. It
is easy to explain a v's passing over to g, as in Ulinger, Adelger, and
especially under the influence of the very common names in -ger. Again,
v might easily become b, as in Olbert, or m, as in Hollemen, Olmor; and
the initial R of Rulleman, Romor, etc., may have been carried over from
a prefixed Herr.[85]

The original name of the heroine has been lost, and yet it is to be
noticed that Gert Olbert's mother, in German #A#, is called Fru Jutte.

The heroine in this same ballad is named Helena (Linnich in #F#); in
others (German #C#, #D#, #E#), Odilia. These are names of saints, and
this circumstance may tend to show that the woman in the ballad was
originally conceived of as rather a saint than a secular character,
though in the course of time the story has so changed that the devout
widow who sought out her country's enemy in his own camp has been
transformed into a young maid who is enticed from home by a treacherous
suitor.

It is an original trait in the ballad that the murderer, as is expressly
said in many copies, is from a foreign land. According to an English
version (#E#), he comes from the north, as Holofernes does, "venit Assur
ex montibus ab aquilone" (Jud. xvi, 5).

The germ of this outlandish knight's bloodthirstiness is found in the
truculent part that Holofernes plays in the Bible, his threats and
devastations. That the false suitor appears without companions is in
keeping with the ballad style of representation; yet we might find
suggestions of the Assyrian's army in the swains, the brothers, the
stable-boy, whom the maid falls in with on her way home.

The splendid promises made in many of the ballads might have been
developed from the passage where Holofernes, whose bed is described as
wrought with purple, gold, and precious stones, says to Judith, Thou
shalt be great in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, and thy name shall be
named in all the earth (xi, 21).

In many forms of the ballad, especially the Dutch and the German, the
maid adorns herself splendidly, as Judith does: she even wears some sort
of crown in Dutch #A# 16, German #D# 8, as Judith does in x, 3, xvi, 10
(mitram).

In the English #D#, #E#, #F#, the oldest Danish, #A#, and the Polish
versions, the maid, like Judith, leaves her home in the night.

The Piedmontese cast['e], Italian #E# 1 [there is a castle in nearly all
the Italian ballads, and also in Dutch #B#], may remind us of
Holofernes' castra.

The knight's carrying off the maid, lifting her on to his horse in many
copies, may well come from a misunderstanding of elevaverunt in Judith
x, 20: Et cum in faciem ejus intendisset, adoravit eum, prosternens se
super terram. Et elevaverunt eam servi Holofernis, jubente domino
suo.[86]

In German #A# Gert Olbert and Helena are said to ride three days and
nights, and in Danish #D# the ride is for three days; and we may
remember that Judith killed Holofernes the fourth day after her arrival
in his camp.

The place in which the pair alight is, according to German #G# 20, a
deep dale, and this agrees with the site of Holofernes' camp in the
valley of Bethulia. There is a spring or stream in many of the ballads,
and also a spring in the camp, in which Judith bathes (xii, 7).

Most forms of the ballad make the knight, after the halt, inform the
maid that she is to die, as many maids have before her in the same
place; e.g., German #G# 7:

    'Der Ulinger hat eylff Jungfrawen gehangen,
    Die zw[:o]lfft hat er gefangen.'[87]

This corresponds with the passage in Judith's song (xvi, 6), $Dixit se$
... infantes meos $dare$ in pr[ae]dam et $virgenes in captivitatem$: but it
is reasonable to suppose that the ballad follows some version of the
Bible words that varied much from the original.

The incident of the maid's lousing and tousing her betrayer's hair,
while he lies with his head in her lap, may have come from Judith
seizing Holofernes by the hair before she kills him, but the story of
Samson and Delilah may have had influence here.

According to many German versions, the murderer grants the maid three
cries before she dies. She invokes Jesus, Mary, and her brother. Or she
utters three sighs, the first to God the Father, the second to Jesus,
the third to her brother. These cries or sighs seem to take the place of
Judith's prayer, Confirma me, Domine Deus Israel (xiii, 7), and it may
also be well to remember that Holofernes granted Judith, on her request,
permission to go out in the night to pray.

The Dutch, Low-German, Scandinavian, and other versions agree in making
the woman kill the knight with his own sword, as in Judith. The Dutch
and Low-German [also Danish #F#, Swedish #A#] have preserved an original
trait in making the maid hew off the murderer's head. English and French
versions dispose of the knight differently: the maid pushes him into sea
or river. Perhaps, in some older form of the story, after the head was
cut off, the _trunk_ was pushed into the water: cf. Judith xiii, 10:
Abscidit caput ejus et ... evolvit corpus ejus truncum. The words
apprehendit comam capitis ejus (xiii, 9) have their parallel in Dutch
#A#, 33: "Zy nam het hoofd al by het haer." The Dutch ballad makes the
maid carry the head with her.

"Singing and ringing" she rode through the wood: Judith sings a song of
praise to the Lord after her return home.

In English #C-F#, May Colven comes home before dawn, as Judith does. The
Dutch #A# says, When to her father's gate she came, she blew the horn
like a man. Compare Judith xiii, 13: Et dixit Judith a longe custodibus
murorum, Aperite portas!

The Dutch text goes on to say that when the father heard the horn he was
delighted at his daughter's return: and Judith v, 14, Et factum est, cum
audissent viri vocem ejus, vocaverunt presbyteros civitatis.

The conclusion of Dutch #A# is that there was a banquet held, and the
head was set on the table. So Judith causes Holofernes' head to be hung
up on the city wall, and after the enemy have been driven off, the Jews
hold a feast.

The Icelandic version, though elsewhere much mutilated, has a concluding
stanza which certainly belongs to the ballad:

    ['A]sa went into a holy cell,
    Never did she harm to man.

This agrees with the view taken of the heroine of the ballad as a saint,
and with the Bible account that Judith lived a chaste widow after her
husband's demise.

Danish #D# is unique in one point. The robber has shown the maid a
little knoll, in which the "much gold" of the women he has murdered
lies. When she has killed him, the maid says, "_I_ shall have the much
gold," and takes as much as she can carry off. Compare with this
Holofernes putting Judith into his treasury (xii, 1),[88] her carrying
off the conop[oe]um (xiii, 10), and her receiving from the people all
Holofernes' gold, silver, clothes, jewels, and furniture, as her share
of the plunder of the Assyrian camp (xv, 14). It is, perhaps, a
perversion of this circumstance that the robber in German #G#, #H#, is
refused permission to keep his costly clothes.

English #D# seems also to have preserved a portion of the primitive
story, when it makes the maid tell her parents in the morning all that
has happened, whereupon they go with her to the sea-shore to find the
robber's body. The foundation for this is surely the Bible account that
Judith makes known her act to the elders of the city, and that the Jews
go out in the morning and fall on the enemy's camp, in which Holofernes'
body is lying. In Swedish #C# the robber's sisters mourn over his body,
and in Judith xiv, 18 the Assyrians break out into loud cries when they
learn of Holofernes' death.

In all this it is simply contended that the story of Judith is the
remote source of the ballad, and it is conceded that many of the
correspondences which have been cited may be accidental. Neither the
Latin text of Judith nor any other written treatment of the story of
Judith is supposed to have been known to the author of the ballad. The
knowledge of its biblical origin being lost, the story would develop
itself in its own way, according to the fashion of oral tradition. And
so the pious widow into whose hands God gave over his enemies is
converted into a fair maid who is enticed by a false knight into a wood,
and who kills him in defence of her own life.

A similar transformation can be shown elsewhere in popular poetry. The
little Katie of certain northern ballads (see Grundtvig, No 101) is a
maid among other maids who prefers death to dishonor; but was originally
Saint Catherine, daughter of the king of Egypt, who suffered martyrdom
for the faith under the Emperor Maxentius. All the versions of the
Halewyn ballad which we possess, even the purest, may be far removed
from the primitive, both as to story and as to metrical form. New
features would be taken up, and old ones would disappear. One copy has
preserved genuine particulars, which another has lost, but Dutch
tradition has kept the capital features best of all.[89]

Professor Bugge's argument has been given with an approach to fulness
out of a desire to do entire justice to the distinguished author's case,
though most of the correspondences adduced by him fail to produce any
effect upon my mind.

The case is materially strengthened by the Dutch text #C# ('Roland'),
which was not accessible at the time Bugge's paper was written. The name
Roland is not so close to Holofern as Halewyn, but is still within the
range of conceivable metamorphosis. The points of coincidence between
Dutch #C# and the story of Judith are these: The woman, first making an
elaborate toilet,[90] goes out to seek the man, who is spoken of as
surrounded with soldiers; she is challenged on the way; finds Roland
lying on his bed, which he proposes she shall share (or lose her
life);[91] she cuts off his head, which, after her return home, she
exposes from her window.[92]

If this was the original form of the Dutch ballad, and the Dutch ballad
is the source from which all the other ballads have come, by processes
of dropping, taking up, and transforming, then we may feel compelled to
admit that this ballad might be a wild shoot from the story of Judith.
Any one who bears in mind the strange changes which stories undergo will
hesitate to pronounce this impossible. What poor Ophelia says of us
human creatures is even truer of ballads: "We know what we are, but know
not what we may be."

But when we consider how much would have to be dropped, how much to be
taken up, and how much to be transformed, before the Hebrew "gest" could
be converted into the European ballad, we naturally look for a less
difficult hypothesis. It is a supposition attended with less difficulty
that an independent European tradition existed of a half-human,
half-demonic being, who possessed an irresistible power of decoying away
young maids, and was wont to kill them after he got them into his hands,
but who at last found one who was more than his match, and lost his own
life through her craft and courage. A modification of this story is
afforded by the large class of Bluebeard tales. The Quintalin story
seems to be another variety, with a substitution of lust for
bloodthirst. The Dutch ballad may have been _affected_ by some lost
ballad of Holofern, and may have taken up some of its features, at least
that of carrying home Halewyn's [Roland's] head, which is found in no
other version.[93]

    Fair lady Isabel sits in her bower sewing,
      Aye as the gowans grow gay
    There she heard an elf-knight blawing his horn.
      The first morning in May

    2
    'If I had yon horn that I hear blawing,
    And yon elf-knight to sleep in my bosom.'

    3
    This maiden had scarcely these words spoken,
    Till in at her window the elf-knight has luppen.

    4
    'It's a very strange matter, fair maiden,' said he,
    'I canna blaw my horn but ye call on me.

    5
    'But will ye go to yon greenwood side?
    If ye canna gang, I will cause you to ride.'

    6
    He leapt on a horse, and she on another,
    And they rode on to the greenwood together.

    7
    'Light down, light down, lady Isabel,' said he,
    'We are come to the place where ye are to die.'

    8
    'Hae mercy, hae mercy, kind sir, on me,
    Till ance my dear father and mother I see.'

    9
    'Seven king's-daughters here hae I slain,
    And ye shall be the eight o them.'

    10
    'O sit down a while, lay your head on my knee,
    That we may hae some rest before that I die.'

    11
    She stroakd him sae fast, the nearer he did creep,
    Wi a sma charm she lulld him fast asleep.

    12
    Wi his ain sword-belt sae fast as she ban him,
    Wi his ain dag-durk sae sair as she dang him.

    13
    'If seven king's-daughters here ye hae slain,
    Lye ye here, a husband to them a'.'

    There came a bird out o a bush,
      On water for to dine,
    An sighing sair, says the king's daughter,
      'O wae 's this heart o mine!'

    2
    He 's taen a harp into his hand,
      He 's harped them all asleep,
    Except it was the king's daughter,
      Who one wink couldna get.

    3
    He 's luppen on his berry-brown steed,
      Taen 'er on behind himsell,
    Then baith rede down to that water
      That they ca Wearie's Well.

    4
    'Wide in, wide in, my lady fair,
      No harm shall thee befall;
    Oft times I've watered my steed
      Wi the waters o Wearie's Well.'

    5
    The first step that she stepped in,
      She stepped to the knee;
    And sighend says this lady fair,
      'This water 's nae for me.'

    6
    'Wide in, wide in, my lady fair,
      No harm shall thee befall;
    Oft times I've watered my steed
      Wi the water o Wearie's Well.'

    7
    The next step that she stepped in,
      She stepped to the middle;
    'O,' sighend says this lady fair,
      I 've wat my gowden girdle.'

    8
    'Wide in, wide in, my lady fair,
      No harm shall thee befall;
    Oft times have I watered my steed
      Wi the water o Wearie's Well.'

    9
    The next step that she stepped in,
      She stepped to the chin;
    'O,' sighend says this lady fair,
      'They sud gar twa loves twin.'

    10
    'Seven king's-daughters I 've drownd there,
      In the water o Wearie's Well,
    And I'll make you the eight o them,
      And ring the common bell.'

    11
    'Since I am standing here,' she says,
      'This dowie death to die,
    One kiss o your comely mouth
      I'm sure wad comfort me.'

    12
    He louted him oer his saddle bow,
      To kiss her cheek and chin;
    She 's taen him in her arms twa,
      An thrown him headlong in.

    13
    'Since seven king's daughters ye 've drowned there,
      In the water o Wearie's Well,
    I'll make you bridegroom to them a',
      An ring the bell mysell.'

    14
    And aye she warsled, and aye she swam,
      And she swam to dry lan;
    She thanked God most cheerfully
      The dangers she oercame.

    False Sir John a wooing came
      To a maid of beauty fair;
    May Colven was this lady's name,
      Her father's only heir.

    2
    He wood her butt, he wood her ben,
      He wood her in the ha,
    Until he got this lady's consent
      To mount and ride awa.

    3
    He went down to her father's bower,
      Where all the steeds did stand,
    And he 's taken one of the best steeds
      That was in her father's land.

    4
    He 's got on and she 's got on,
      And fast as they could flee,
    Until they came to a lonesome part,
      A rock by the side of the sea.

    5
    'Loup off the steed,' says false Sir John,
      'Your bridal bed you see;
    For I have drowned seven young ladies,
      The eight one you shall be.

    6
    'Cast off, cast off, my May Colven,
      All and your silken gown,
    For it 's oer good and oer costly
      To rot in the salt sea foam.

    7
    'Cast off, cast off, my May Colven,
      All and your embroiderd shoen,
    For they 're oer good and oer costly
      To rot in the salt sea foam.'

    8
    'O turn you about, O false Sir John,
      And look to the leaf of the tree,
    For it never became a gentleman
      A naked woman to see.'

    9
    He turnd himself straight round about,
      To look to the leaf of the tree;
    So swift as May Colven was
      To throw him in the sea.

    10
    'O help, O help, my May Colven,
      O help, or else I'll drown;
    I'll take you home to your father's bower,
      And set you down safe and sound.'

    11
    'No help, no help, O false Sir John,
      No help, nor pity thee;
    Tho seven king's-daughters you have drownd,
      But the eight shall not be me.'

    12
    So she went on her father's steed,
      As swift as she could flee,
    And she came home to her father's bower
      Before it was break of day.

    13
    Up then and spoke the pretty parrot:
      'May Colven, where have you been?
    What has become of false Sir John,
      That woo'd you so late the streen?

    14
    'He woo'd you butt, he woo'd you ben,
      He woo'd you in the ha,
    Until he got your own consent
      For to mount and gang awa.'

    15
    'O hold your tongue, my pretty parrot,
      Lay not the blame upon me;
    Your cup shall be of the flowered gold,
      Your cage of the root of the tree.'

    16
    Up then spake the king himself,
      In the bed-chamber where he lay:
    'What ails the pretty parrot,
      That prattles so long or day?'

    17
    'There came a cat to my cage door,
      It almost a worried me,
    And I was calling on May Colven
      To take the cat from me.'

    1
    O heard ye of a bloody knight,
      Lived in the south country?
    For he has betrayed eight ladies fair
      And drowned them in the sea.

    2
    Then next he went to May Collin,
      She was her father's heir,
    The greatest beauty in the land,
      I solemnly declare.

    3
    'I am a knight of wealth and might,
      Of townlands twenty-three;
    And you'll be lady of them all,
      If you will go with me.'

    4
    'Excuse me, then, Sir John,' she says;
      'To wed I am too young;
    Without I have my parents' leave,
      With you I darena gang.'

    5
    'Your parents' leave you soon shall have,
      In that they will agree;
    For I have made a solemn vow
      This night you'll go with me.'

    6
    From below his arm he pulled a charm,
      And stuck it in her sleeve,
    And he has made her go with him,
      Without her parents' leave.

    7
    Of gold and silver she has got
      With her twelve hundred pound,
    And the swiftest steed her father had
      She has taen to ride upon.

    8
    So privily they went along,
      They made no stop or stay,
    Till they came to the fatal place
      That they call Bunion Bay.

    9
    It being in a lonely place,
      And no house there was nigh,
    The fatal rocks were long and steep,
      And none could hear her cry.

    10
    'Light down,' he said, 'fair May Collin,
      Light down and speak with me,
    For here I've drowned eight ladies fair,
      And the ninth one you shall be.'

    11
    'Is this your bowers and lofty towers,
      So beautiful and gay?
    Or is it for my gold,' she said,
      'You take my life away?'

    12
    'Strip off,' he says, 'thy jewels fine,
      So costly and so brave,
    For they are too costly and too fine
      To throw in the sea wave.'

    13
    'Take all I have my life to save,
      O good Sir John, I pray;
    Let it neer be said you killed a maid
      Upon her wedding day.'

    14
    'Strip off,' he says, 'thy Holland smock,
      That's bordered with the lawn,
    For it's too costly and too fine
      To rot in the sea sand.'

    15
    'O turn about, Sir John,' she said,
      'Your back about to me,
    For it never was comely for a man
      A naked woman to see.'

    16
    But as he turned him round about,
      She threw him in the sea,
    Saying, 'Lie you there, you false Sir John,
      Where you thought to lay me.

    17
    'O lie you there, you traitor false,
      Where you thought to lay me,
    For though you stripped me to the skin,
      Your clothes you've got with thee.'

    18
    Her jewels fine she did put on,
      So costly, rich and brave,
    And then with speed she mounts his steed,
      So well she did behave.

    19
    That lady fair being void of fear,
      Her steed being swift and free,
    And she has reached her father's gate
      Before the clock struck three.

    20
    Then first she called the stable groom,
      He was her waiting man;
    Soon as he heard his lady's voice
      He stood with cap in hand.

    21
    'Where have you been, fair May Collin?
      Who owns this dapple grey?'
    'It is a found one,' she replied,
      'That I got on the way.'

    22
    Then out bespoke the wily parrot
      Unto fair May Collin:
    'What have you done with false Sir John,
      That went with you yestreen?'

    23
    'O hold your tongue, my pretty parrot,
      And talk no more to me,
    And where you had a meal a day
      O now you shall have three.'

    24
    Then up bespoke her father dear,
      From his chamber where he lay:
    'What aileth thee, my pretty Poll,
      That you chat so long or day?'

    25
    'The cat she came to my cage-door,
      The thief I could not see,
    And I called to fair May Collin,
      To take the cat from me.'

    26
    Then first she told her father dear
      The deed that she had done,
    And next she told her mother dear
      Concerning false Sir John.

    27
    'If this be true, fair May Collin,
      That you have told to me,
    Before I either eat or drink
      This false Sir John I'll see.'

    28
    Away they went with one consent,
      At dawning of the day,
    Until they came to Carline Sands,
      And there his body lay.

    29
    His body tall, by that great fall,
      By the waves tossed to and fro,
    The diamond ring that he had on
      Was broke in pieces two.

    30
    And they have taken up his corpse
      To yonder pleasant green,
    And there they have buried false Sir John,
      For fear he should be seen.

    An outlandish knight came from the north lands,
      And he came a-wooing to me;
    He told me he'd take me unto the north lands,
      And there he would marry me.

    2
    'Come, fetch me some of your father's gold,
      And some of your mother's fee,
    And two of the best nags out of the stable,
      Where they stand thirty and three.'

    3
    She fetched him some of her father's gold,
      And some of her mother's fee,
    And two of the best nags out of the stable,
      Where they stood thirty and three.

    4
    She mounted her on her milk-white steed,
      He on the dapple grey;
    They rode till they came unto the sea-side,
      Three hours before it was day.

    5
    'Light off, light off thy milk-white steed,
      And deliver it unto me;
    Six pretty maids have I drowned here,
      And thou the seventh shalt be.

    6
    'Pull off, pull off thy silken gown,
      And deliver it unto me;
    Methinks it looks too rich and too gay
      To rot in the salt sea.

    7
    'Pull off, pull off thy silken stays,
      And deliver them unto me;
    Methinks they are too fine and gay
      To rot in the salt sea.

    8
    'Pull off, pull off thy Holland smock,
      And deliver it unto me;
    Methinks it looks too rich and gay
      To rot in the salt sea.'

    9
    'If I must pull off my Holland smock,
      Pray turn thy back unto me;
    For it is not fitting that such a ruffian
      A naked woman should see.'

    10
    He turned his back towards her
      And viewed the leaves so green;
    She catched him round the middle so small,
      And tumbled him into the stream.

    11
    He dropped high and he dropped low,
      Until he came to the side;
    'Catch hold of my hand, my pretty maiden,
      And I will make you my bride.'

    12
    'Lie there, lie there, you false-hearted man,
      Lie there instead of me;
    Six pretty maids have you drowned here,
      And the seventh has drowned thee.'

    13
    She mounted on her milk-white steed,
      And led the dapple grey;
    She rode till she came to her own father's hall,
      Three hours before it was day.

    14
    The parrot being in the window so high,
      Hearing the lady, did say,
    'I'm afraid that some ruffian has led you astray,
      That you have tarried so long away.'

    15
    'Don't prittle nor prattle, my pretty parrot,
      Nor tell no tales of me;
    Thy cage shall be made of the glittering gold,
      Although it is made of a tree.'

    16
    The king being in the chamber so high,
      And hearing the parrot, did say,
    'What ails you, what ails you, my pretty parrot,
      That you prattle so long before day?'

    17
    'It's no laughing matter,' the parrot did say,
      'That so loudly I call unto thee,
    For the cats have got into the window so high,
      And I'm afraid they will have me.'

    18
    'Well turned, well turned, my pretty parrot,
      Well turned, well turned for me;
    Thy cage shall be made of the glittering gold,
      And the door of the best ivory.'

    'Go fetch me some of your father's gold,
      And some of your mother's fee,
    And I'll carry you into the north land,
      And there I'll marry thee.'

    2
    She fetchd him some of her father's gold,
      And some of her mother's fee;
    She carried him into the stable,
      Where horses stood thirty and three.

    3
    She leapd on a milk-white steed,
      And he on a dapple-grey;
    They rode til they came to a fair river's side,
      Three hours before it was day.

    4
    'O light, O light, you lady gay,
      O light with speed, I say,
    For six knight's daughters have I drowned here,
      And you the seventh must be.'

    5
    'Go fetch the sickle, to crop the nettle
      That grows so near the brim,
    For fear it should tangle my golden locks,
      Or freckle my milk-white skin.'

    6
    He fetchd the sickle, to crop the nettle
      That grows so near the brim,
    And with all the strength that pretty Polly had
      She pushd the false knight in.

    7
    'Swim on, swim on, thou false knight,
      And there bewail thy doom,
    For I don't think thy cloathing too good
      To lie in a watry tomb.'

    8
    She leaped on her milk-white steed,
      She led the dapple grey;
    She rid till she came to her father's house,
      Three hours before it was day.

    9
    'Who knocked so loudly at the ring?'
      The parrot he did say;
    'O where have you been, my pretty Polly,
      All this long summer's day?'

    10
    'O hold your tongue, parrot,
      Tell you no tales of me;
    Your cage shall be made of beaten gold,
      Which is now made of a tree.'

    11
    O then bespoke her father dear,
      As he on his bed did lay:
    'O what is the matter, my parrot,
      That you speak before it is day?'

    12
    'The cat's at my cage, master,
      And sorely frighted me,
    And I calld down my Polly
      To take the cat away.'

        _Motherwell's one stanza is:_

          O heard ye eer o a bloody knight
            That livd in the west countrie?
          For he has stown seven ladies fair,
            And drownd them a' in the sea.

#E.#

        3^2. of the.

        17^2. But so.


[24] 'The Elfin Knight' begins very much like #A#, but perhaps has
borrowed its opening stanzas from this ballad. See page 13.

[25] The second stanza, which describes the harping, occurs again in
'Glenkindie' (st. 6).

[26] Perhaps the change from wood, #A#, to water, #B-F#, was made under
the influence of some Merman ballad, or by admixture with such a ballad;
e.g., 'N[/o]kkens Svig,' Grundtvig, No 39. In this (#A#) the nix entices a
king's daughter away from a dance, sets her on his horse, and rides with
her over the heath to a wild water, into which she sinks. It is also
quite among possibilities that there was originally an English nix
ballad, in which the king's daughter saved herself by some artifice,
not, of course, such as is employed in #B-F#, but like that in #A#, or
otherwise. Maid Heiemo, in Landstad, No 39, kills a nix with "one of her
small knives." Had she put him to sleep with a charm, and killed him
with _his own_ knife, as Lady Isabel does, there would have been nothing
to shock credibility in the story.

Aytoun, Ballads of Scotland, I, 219, 2d ed., hastily pronounces Buchan's
ballad not authentic, "being made up of stanzas borrowed from versions
of 'Burd Helen' ['Child Waters']." There are, indeed, three successive
steps into the water in both ballads, but Aytoun should have bethought
himself how natural and how common it is for a passage to slip from one
ballad into another, when the circumstances of the story are the same;
and in some such cases no one can say where the verses that are common
originally belonged. Here, indeed, as Grundtvig remarks, IV, 7, note*,
it may well be that the verses in question belonged originally to 'Burd
Helen,' and were adopted (but in the processes of tradition) into 'The
Water of Wearie's Well;' for it must be admitted that the transaction in
the water is not a happy conception in the latter, since it shocks
probability that the woman should be able to swim ashore, and the man
not.

[27] "This ballad appears modern, from a great many expressions, but yet
I am certain that it is old: the present copy came from the housekeeper
at Methven." Note by Sharpe, in Laing's ed. of the Ballad Book, 1880, p.
130, xvii. Motherwell, in his Minstrelsy, p. lxx, n. 24, says that he
had seen a stall ballad as early as 1749, entitled 'The Western
Tragedy,' which perfectly agreed with Sharpe's copy. But in his
Note-Book, p. 5 (about 1826-7), Motherwell says, "The best copy of May
Colean with which I have met occurs in a stall copy printed about thirty
years ago [should we then read 1799 instead of 1749?], under the title
of 'The Western Tragedy.' I have subsequently seen a posterior reprint
of this stall copy under this title, 'The Historical Ballad of May
Collean.' In Mr. Sharpe's Ballad Book, the same copy, wanting only one
stanza, is given."

[28] According to the variation given by Willems, and adopted by
Hoffmann, Halewijn's _son_ came to meet her, tied her horse to a tree,
and bade her to sit down by him and loose her hair. For every hair she
undid she dropped a tear. But it will presently be seen not only that
the time has not come for them to sit down, but that Halewijn's bidding
her undo her hair (to no purpose) is a perversion of her offering to
"red" _his_, to get him into her power, an offer which she makes in the
German and Scandinavian ballads, where also there is good reason for her
tears, but none as yet here.

[29] J. W. Wolf, Deutsche M[:a]rchen u. Sagen, No 29, p. 143, gives the
story according to #B#, apparently from a ballad like Snellaert's. So
Luise v. Ploennies, Reiseerinnerungen aus Belgien, p. 38.

Halewyn makes his appearance again in the Flemish ballad, 'Halewyn en
het kleyne Kind,' Coussemaker, No 46, p. 149; Po['e]sies populaires de la
France, vol. I. A boy of seven years has shot one of Halewyn's rabbits,
and is for this condemned to be hanged on the highest tree in the park.
The father makes great offers for his ransom, but in vain. On the first
step of the ladder the child looks back for his mother, on the second
for his father, on the third for his brother, on the fourth for his
sister, each of whom successively arrives and is told that delay would
have cost him his life. It will presently be seen that there is a
resemblance here to German ballads (#G-X#, #Z#).

[30] "La chanson de Halewyn, telle [a'] peu pr[e']s que la donnent
Willems, Snellaert et de Coussemaker, se vend encore sur le march['e]
de Bruges. Quoiqu'elle porte pour titre _Halewyn_, jamais notre
pi[e']ce n'a ['e]t['e] connue ici sous ce nom. Le nom de Halewijn,
Alewijn ou Alwin ... est r['e]serv['e] au h['e]ros de la pi[e']ce
suivante" [Mi Adel en Hir Alewijn]. Lootens et Feys, p. 66. "Il est
a regretter que Willems et de Coussemaker n'aient pas jug['e] [a']
propos de donner cette pi[e']ce telle que le peuple l'a conserv['e]e;
on serait sans aucun doute en possession de variantes remarquables, et
les lacunes qui existent dans notre version n'eussent pas manqu['e]
d'[^e]tre com bl['e]es. Il est bon d'insister sur la remarque faite
[a'] la suite de la chanson, qu'[a'] Bruges et dans beaucoup de
localit['e]s de la Flandre, elle n'est connue que sous le titre de
_Roland_. Ajoutons que notre texte appartient au dernier si[e']cle." L.
et F., 295.

[31] So in 'Liebe ohne Stand,' one of the mixed forms of the German
ballad, Wunderhorn, Erk I, 41, Crecelius, I, 36,

    Und als es nun kam an den dritten Tag,
    Da gingen die Pfeiffen und Trommeln an.

[32] E.g., the wonderland in #A# 2-6, and the strict watch kept over the
lady in 7-10 are repeated in 'Ribold og Guldborg,' Grundtvig, 82, #B#
2-7, 8-11, and in 'Den trofaste Jomfru,' ib. 249, #A# 3-6, 7-10. The
watching in #A#, #B#, #C# and the proffered gifts of #C#, #D#, #F# are
found in 'N[/o]kkens Svig,' Grundtvig, 39, #A#, #B#, 12-18. The disguise in
#A# 11-14, the rest in the wood with the knight's head in the lady's
lap, #A# 16, 27, #B# 11, 21, #D# 14, 24, #E# 11, 21, etc., recur in
Ribold, #B# 12-14, #L# 9, 10, #M# 19, 20, #N# 11, 13, #P# 12, 13. These
resemblances, naturally, are not limited to the Danish copies.

[33] So the princess in Asbj[:o]rnsen og Moe, N. Folkeeventyr, p. 153. Cf.
Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands, III, 209; IV, 282, 283.

[34] The binding and waking, with these words, are found also in a
made-up text of 'Fr[ae]ndeh[ae]vn,' Grundtvig, No 4, #C# 51-53, but
certainly borrowed from some copy of 'Kvindemorderen.'

[35] All the German versions appear to have been _originally_ in the
two-line stanza.

[36] The copies with this title in Simrock, No 6, p. 15, and in
Scherer's Jungbrunnen, No 5 A, and his Deutsche V. L., 1851, p. 349, are
compounded from various texts.

[37] Both #D# and #E# have attached to them this final stanza:

    'Odilia, why are thy shoes so red?'
    'It is three doves that I shot dead.'

This is a well-known commonplace in tragic ballads; and Grundtvig
suggests that this stanza was the occasion of the story taking the turn
which we find in ballads of the third class.

[38] One scarcely knows whether this bribe is an imperfect reminiscence
of splendid promises which the knight makes, e.g., in the Danish
ballads, or a shifting from the maid to the knight of the gold which the
elsewhere opulent or well-to-do maid gets together while the knight is
preparing to set forth; or simply one of those extravagances which so
often make their appearance in later versions of ballads.

[39] The number eleven is remarkably constant in the German ballads,
being found in #G#, #H#, #J-L#, #N-W#; it is also the number in Swedish
#B#. Eight is the favorite number in the North, and occurs in Danish
#A-D#, #H-L#, Swedish #A#, #C#, Norwegian #G#, #H#; again in German #I#.
German #M#, #X#, Danish #F#, have ten; German #A#, #B#, Danish #E#,
Norwegian #I#, have nine; German #C#, #D#, seven; Danish #G# has
nineteen. French #A#, #B# have fourteen, fifteen, Italian ballads still
higher numbers: #A#, #B#, #C#, thirty-six, #D#, fifty-two, #E#,
thirty-three, #F#, three hundred and three.

[40] This stroke of realism fails only in #M#, #N#, #R#, of this second
class.

[41] Apparently to a Ribold ballad, of which no other trace has been
found in German. See further on in this volume.

[42]

    13
    'Ach du sch[:o]ne junkfraw fein,
    Du pfalzgr[:a]vin, du kaiserin!
    Der Adelger hat sich vor ailf get[:o]dt,
    Du wirst die zw[:o]lft, das sei dir gsait.

    15
    'So bitt mich nit, du junkfraw fein,
    So bitt mich nit, du herzigs ein!'

The _liebkosung_ of this murder-reeking Adelger, o'ersized with
coagulate gore, is admirably horrible.

[43] Nimmersatt (All-begehrend) as interpreted by Meinert, not Adelger.

[44] Verses which recur, nearly, not only in #Y# 17-19, #W# 27, 28, but
elsewhere, as in a copy of 'Graf Friedrich,' Erk's Liederhort, p. 41, No
15, st. 19.

[45] There is no sense in _two_ doves. The single dove one may suppose
to be the spirit of the last victim. We shall find the _eleven_
appearing as doves in #Q#. There is no occasion to regard the dove here
as a Waldminne (Vilmar, Handb[:u]chlein f[:u]r Freunde des deutschen
Volkslieds, p. 57). Cf. the nightingale (and two nightingales) in the
Danish 'Redselille og Medelvold:' see 'Leesome Brand,' further on in
this volume.

[46] This ballad has become, in T[:u]bingen, a children's game, called
'Bertha im Wald.' The three cries are preserved in verse, and very
nearly as in #J#, #M#. The game concludes by the robber smothering
Bertha. Meier, Deutsche Kinder-Reime, No 439.

[47] #K#, or the editor, seeks to avoid the difficulty by taking the
last line from the knight, and reading, "Mit Blut war er umronnen," an
emendation not according with the simplicity of ballads. Another Swabian
copy, Meier, p. 301, note, strophe 6, has:

    'Wir m[:u]ssen zu selbigem Bronnen
    Wo Wasser und Blut heraus ronnen.'

[48] The last verses are these, and not very much worse than the rest:

    Mein Bruder ist ein J[:a]gersmann,
    Der alle Thierlein schiessen kann;
    Er hatt' ein zweischneidiges Schwerte,
    Und stach es dem Falschen ins Herze.

    Ihr M[:a]dchen alle insgemein,
    Lasst euch doch diess zur Warnung sein,
    Und geht doch mit keinem so falschen
    In einen so finsteren Walde.

    My brother is a hunting man,
    And all the small game shoot he can;
    He had a sword with edges two,
    And ran the heart of the false man through

    Ye maidens now in general,
    Let this be warning to you all;
    With man so false you never should
    Go to _so very_ dark a wood.

[49] So in Rochholz, Schweizer Sagen, No 14, I, 23, a man who had killed
eleven maids would, if he could have made up the number twelve, have
been able to pass through walls and mouseholes. Again, a certain robber
in Jutland, who had devoured eight children's hearts, would have
acquired the power of flying could he but have secured one more.
Grundtvig, D. g. F. IV, 16, note.

[50] What will those who are so troubled about cork-heeled shoon in 'Sir
Patrick Spens' say to the fire-arms in #L#, #N#, #S#?

[51] A variety of #W#, cited in Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 26, has,

    'Ach Ulbrich, Ulbrich, Halsemann, Halsemann,
    Lass du mich nur drei Gale schrei'n!'

Grundtvig, assuming that the name is Ulbrich Halsemann, would account
for the second and superfluous character here [found also in #W#] by a
divarication of Ulrich Halsemann into Ulrich _and_ Halsemann (Hanslein).
Ansar, "bisher unverst[:a]ndlicher Vorname des Ritters Uleraich" in #Y#
(Meinert), would equally well yield Hanslein. Might not Halsemann
possibly be an equivalent of Halsherr?

[52] And in 'Der Mutter Fluch,' Meinert, p. 246, a ballad with which #Y#
agrees in the first two and last four stanzas.

[53] There is a dove in #Z#, but #Z#, as has been said, presents traits
of all three classes.

[54]

    'Da lyge, feyns Lybchen, unndt fawle,
    Meyn jungk Herze muss trawren.'

                              Nicolai, vv 35, 36,

    'Da liege, du H[:a]uptchen, und faule,
    Kein Reuter wird dir nachtrauern.'

                              Simrock, vv 35, 36,

are evidently derived from the apostrophe to the murderer's head in #I#,
#W#, #Y#.

Stolz Syburg is the hero of a very different ballad, from the M[:u]nster
region, Reifferscheid, No 16, p. 32 (also No 17, and Simrock, No 9, p.
23, 'Stolz Heinrich'). And from this the name, in consequence of a
remote resemblance in the story, may have been taken up by the Rhine
ballad, though it has contributed nothing more. Margaret, a king's
daughter, is wiled away by a splendid description of Stolz Syburg's
opulence. When they have gone a long way, he tells her that he has
nothing but a barren heath. She stabs herself at his feet.

[55] 'Wassermans Braut,' Meinert, p. 77; 'Die ungl[:u]ckliche Braut,'
Hoffmann u. Richter, Schlesische V. L., p. 6, No. 2; 'K[:o]nigs
T[:o]chterlein,' Erk u. Irmer, vi, 6, No 4; 'Der Wassermann,' Erk's
Liederhort, p. 50, No 17. ('Die Nixenbraut,' "Norddeutschland,"
Zuccalmaglio, p. 192, No 92, seems to be Meinert's copy written over.)

[56] The remarkable Norwegian ballad of the 'Wassermanns Brant' group,
The Nix and Heiemo, Landstad, No 39, p. 350, has not been unaffected by
the one we are now occupied with. There is even a verbal contact between
stanza 19,

    'Heiemo tenkte me[dh] sjave seg:
    Tru mine sm['a] _knivar_ 'ki hjelper meg?'

and Norwegian #F#, stanza 9, cited by Grundtvig, IV, 4,

    Lengji st['o] Gullbj[:o]r, h['o] tenkte m[ae] seg:
    'Kann inkje m['i]' _r['u]ninne_ hjelpe meg?'

[57] Kolberg's #b#, #h#, #k#, #v#, #x#, #bb#, #cc#, #hh#, #kk#, #ll#,
#nn#, #xx#, #yy#, #zz#, consist of only one or two initial stanzas,
containing no important variation. His #aaa#, a fragment of six stanzas,
Pauli, p. 147, No 6, Wojcicki, II, 169, though it begins like the rest,
sounds like a different ballad.

The ballad in Wojcicki, I, 38, is allied with the one we are engaged
with, and the two fragments on p. 36, p. 37 with both this and that.

[58] Anne in #R#, #LL#, and Kolberg's #h#: Mary in #I#, #U#, #II#:
Ursula, #N#: both Catherine and Alice, #AA#. John is found in all but
#N#, where there is a nameless seigneur.

[59] They are expressly said to go off in a carriage in #I#, #O#, #Q#,
#T#, #BB#, #DD#, #FF#. Still, in #I#, John says, "Let the black horse
have something to carry under us." In #O#, #T#, #FF#, the horses have a
presentiment of evil to their mistress, and refuse to stir.

[60] One version of 'The Two Sisters,' #Q#, has the same answer:

    'I did not put you in with the design
    Just for to pull you out again.'

                              st. 9.

This might be called a formula in Polish ballads: something of the kind
occurs three times in #X#, four times in #B#, five times in #P#; in
other ballads also. In #Q# 25, Catherine clutches the river bank, and
John pushes away her hands. Compare 'The Two Sisters,' #F# 9, further on
in this volume.

[61] #L#, #L*#, #M#, #N#, as already said, confuse the two catastrophes.
John says, in #N#, "Do you see that broad river? I will measure its
depth by throwing you in." We may assume that he was as good as his
word. But Ursula made her way home through woods and forests, weeping
her eyes out on the way. Kind souls dug a grave for her. The conclusion
of #M# is absurd, but need not be particularized. #G# has a passage of
the sternest theology. While Catherine is struggling in the water, her
father comes by. She cries to him to save her. He says, "My dear
Catherine, you have loved pleasure too much. Lord Jesus grant you
drown!" Her mother appears, and makes the same reply to her daughter's
appeal. There are stall-copy terminal morals to many of the ballads.

[62] #N# 1, "A lord came riding from his estate to a neighbor."

[63] The place is high above the water in #R# 10, 11, as in English #D#
9, 29, #C# 4.

[64] #BB# 6, "My mother said that I had seen you; she will _watch me
closely_," may be an accidental coincidence with Danish #A# 7-9, #B#
6-8, etc.

[65] The second, and more valuable, volume of Waldau's B. G. I have
found it impossible to obtain. Reifferscheid cites the ballad at p. 166.

[66] A few silly verses follow in the original, in which Thomas treats
what he had said as a jest. These are properly rejected by Talvj as a
spurious appendage.

[67]

    'De achte de soll Helena sin,
    De achte de most he s[:o]lwer sin.'

                              German #A b# 13.

[68] Another version of this double ballad, but much corrupted in the
second part, was known to G['e]rard de Nerval. See Les Filles du Feu,
[OE]uvres compl[e']tes, V, 132.

[69] So far there is agreement in 'La Fille du Prince,' Paymaigre, No
32, p. 106; Po['e]sies pop. de la France, MS., III, fol. 133.

[70] The Asturian romance communicated in two copies by Amador de los
Rios to Jahrbuch f[:u]r rom. u. eng. Literatur, III, 285, No 2, and the
Portuguese 'Romance de Romeirinha,' Braga, Romanceiro, No 9, p. 24, 'A
Romeira,' Almeida-Garrett, III, 11, are not parallels, though they have
been cited as such.

Collection of Magyar Popular Poetry, New Series, Pest, 1872, 2 vols.
Aigner, has blended Nos 4 and 3 (#C#, #A#) in 'Martin und Aennchen,'
Ungarische Volksdichtungen, p. 170, and has translated No 1 (#E#), at
p. 120, 'Moln['a]r Anna,' in each case obscuring or omitting one or two
traits which are important for a comparative view.

[72] Very little remains of the artifice in Polish #A#. The idea seems
to be that the girl pretends to be curious about the sword in order to
get it into her hands. But the whole story is told in ten stanzas.

[73] I accept and repeat Grundtvig's views as to the relation of the
three forms of the story. And with regard to the history of the ballad
generally, this is but one of many cases in which much or most of the
work had been done to my hand in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser.

[74] Memering was required by his adversary to swear that he knew not of
the sword Adelring, and took his oath that he knew of nothing but the
hilt being above ground, which was accepted as satisfactory. Presently
he pulls Adelring out of the ground, into which he had thrust the blade,
and, being accused of perjury, triumphantly rejoins that he had sworn
that he knew of nothing but the hilt _being above ground_. Dietrich does
the same in his duel with Sigurd Swain.

[75] Magyar #A# is entirely peculiar. Apparently the man lays his head
in the woman's lap that he may know, by the falling of her tears, when
she has disobeyed his command not to look into the tree. This is like
'Bluebeard,' and rather subtle for a ballad.

[76] 'Child Waters,' 'The Fair Flower of Northumberland.'

[77] The murderer has a horn in Swedish #C#, #D#, as also in the Dutch
Halewyn and the German #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, and the horn may be of
magical power, but it is not distinctly described as such.

[78] The scenery of the halting-place in the wood--the bloody streams in
Danish #A#, #B#, #D#, #H#, #L#, #K#, the blood-girt spring in German
#H#, #J#, #K#, #L#, #O#, #P#, #Q#--is also, to say the least, suggestive
of something horribly uncanny. These are undoubtedly ancient features,
though the spring, as the Danish editor observes, has no longer any
significancy in the German ballads, because in all of them the previous
victims are said to have been _hanged_.

[79] The saga in Bj[:o]rner's Nordiska K[:a]mpadater, c. 5-7.

[80] Danish #E#, #I#, #L#, and even #A#, make the knight suggest to the
lady that she should get her gold together while he is saddling his
horse; but this is a commonplace found in other cases of elopement, and
_by itself_ warrants no conclusion as to the knight's rapacity. See
'Samson,' Grundtvig, No 6, #C# 5; 'Ribold og Guldborg,' No 82, #C# 13,
#E# 14, etc.; 'Redselille og Medelvold,' No 271, #A# 21, #B# 20; 272,
Bilag 3, st. 8; 270, 18, etc.

[81] So perhaps a Polish ballad in Wojcicki, I, 38, akin to the other
John and Katie ballads.

[82] It is well known that in the Middle Ages the blood of children or
of virgins was reputed a specific for leprosy (see, e.g., Cassel in the
Weimar Jahrb[:u]cher, I, 408.) Some have thought to find in this fact an
explanation of the murders in these ballads and in the Bluebeard
stories, and, according to Rochholz, this theory has been adopted into
popular tradition in the Aargau. So far as this cycle of ballads is
concerned, there is as much ground for holding that the blood was wanted
to cure leprosy as for believing that the gold was wanted for _aurum
potabile_.

femogtyveaarige Virksomhed, 1854-79, Bidrag til den nordiske
Balladedigtnings Historie, p. 75 ff.

[84] Bugge cites the Old German Judith, M[:u]llenhoff u. Scherer,
Denkm[:a]ler, 2d ed., No 37, p. 105, to show how the Bible story became
modified under a popular treatment.

[85] Holefern might doubtless pass into Halewyn, but there is not the
slightest need of Holefern to _account_ for Halewyn. Halewyn, besides
being a well-known local and family appellation, is found in two other
Dutch ballads, one of which (Lootens and Feys, p. 66, No 38; Hoffmann,
p. 46, No 11) has no kind of connection with the present, and is no more
likely to have derived the name from this than this from that. It shall
not be denied that Adelger, Hilsinger, Rullemann, Reimvord might have
sprung from or have been suggested by Holofern, under the influence of
familiar terminations, but it may be remarked that Hildebrand,
Ravengaard, Valdemar, Rosmer, if they had occurred in any version, would
have occasioned no greater difficulty.

[86] The Old German poem makes Holofernes kindle with desire for Judith
the moment he sees her, and he bids his men bring her to his tent. They
lift her up and bring her in.

[87] It should be observed that these words are from the dove's warning.

[88] Simply because he had no other apartment at his disposition. Shall
we add, the Polish mother putting her daughter into the "new room," in
which she kept her valuables?

[89] Bugge holds that the ballad was derived by the Scandinavians from
the Germans, more precisely by the Danes from a Low German form. This,
he says, would follow from what he has maintained above, and he finds
support for his view in many particular traits of Norse copies. Thus,
one of the Norwegian names for the murderer is Alemarken. The first
three syllables are very near to the Danish Oldemor; but -ken seems to
be the German diminutive suffix, and can only be explained by the ballad
having come from Germany.

[90] This toilet derives importance solely from the agreement with
Judith x, 3: for the rest it is entirely in the ballad style. Compare
the toilets in 'Hafsfrun,' Afzelius, No 92, III, 148, Arwidsson, No 150,
II, 320, Wigstr[:o]m, Folkdiktning, No 2, p. 11, Landstad, No 55, p. 494:
'Guldsmedens Datter,' Grundtvig, No. 245, IV, 481 ff, Wigstr[:o]m, ib., No
18, p. 37, Landstad, No 43, p. 437: Torkilds Riim, Lyngbye, F[ae]r[/o]iske
Qv[ae]der, 534, 535, Afzelius, III, 202: 'Stolts Karin,' Arwidsson, No 63,
I, 388: 'Liti Kerstis hevn,' Landstad, No 67, p. 559 == 'Lord Thomas and
Fair Annet': in many of which there is a gold crown. There is a man's
toilet in Grundtvig, No 207, IV, 201.

[91] Bugge would naturally have seen the Assyrian scouts that Judith
falls in with (x, 11) in Roland's father, mother, and brother, all of
whom hail the maid as she is making for Roland's quarters (#C# 30-38);
still more "Holofernes jacebat in lecto" (xiii, 4), in "Roland die op
zijn bedde lag," #C# 39.

[92] Judith xiv, 1: "Suspendite caput hoc super muros nostros." The
cutting off and bringing home of the head, as need hardly be said, is
not of itself remarkable, being found everywhere from David to Be['o]wulf,
and from Be['o]wulf to 'Sir Andrew Barton.'

[93] Dutch #B#, which, as before said, has been completely rewritten,
makes the comparison with Holofernes:

    34
    'Ik heb van't leven hem beroofd,
    in mynen schoot heb ik zyn hoofd,
    hy is als Holofernes gelooft.'

    37
    Zy reed dan voort als Judith wys,
    zoo regt nae haer vaders paleis,
    daer zy wierd ingehaeld met eer en prys.

Eight copies of this ballad are extant, four of them hitherto
unpublished. #A a#, No 16 in the Jamieson-Brown MS., is one of twenty
ballads written down from the recitation of Mrs. Brown of Falkland, by
her nephew, Robert Scott, in 1783, or shortly before. From these twenty
thirteen were selected, and, having first been revised by Mrs. Brown,
were sent, with two others, to William Tytler in the year just
mentioned. William Tytler's MS. has disappeared, but a list of the
ballads which it contained, with the first stanza of each, is given by
Dr Anderson, in Nichols's Illustrations of the Literary History of the
Eighteenth Century, VII, 176. #B# is the 'Cospatrick' of the Border
Minstrelsy, described by Scott as taken down from the recitation of a
lady (known to be Miss Christian Rutherford, his mother's sister) "with
some stanzas transferred from Herd's copy, and some readings adopted
from a copy in Mrs Brown's manuscript under the title of Child Brenton,"
that is, from #A b#. #C# purports to be one of a considerable number of
pieces, "copied from the recital of a peasant-woman of Galloway, upwards
of ninety years of age." Though overlaid with verses of Cunningham's
making (of which forty or fifty may be excided in one mass) and though
retouched almost everywhere, both the groundwork of the story and some
genuine lines remain unimpaired. The omission of most of the passage
referred to, and the restoration of the stanza form, will give us,
perhaps, a thing of shreds and patches, but still a ballad as near to
genuine as some in Percy's Reliques or even Scott's Minstrelsy. #D# and
#F# are (the former presumably, the second certainly) from recitation of
the first quarter of this century. #E# is one of the few ballads in
Elizabeth Cochrane's song-book, and probably of the first half of the
last century. #G#, the earliest printed form of the ballad, appeared in
Herd's first collection, in the year 1769. #H# was taken down from
recitation by the late Dr Hill Burton in his youth.

#A#, #B#, and #C# agree in these points: A bride, not being a maid,
looks forward with alarm to her wedding night, and induces her
bower-woman to take her place for the nonce. The imposture is detected
by the bridegroom, through the agency of magical blankets, sheets, and
pillows, #A#; or of blankets, bed, sheet, and sword, #B#; or simply of
the Billie Blin, #C#. (The sword is probably an editorial insertion; and
Jamieson, Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 343, doubts, but
without sufficient reason, the Billie Blin.) The bridegroom has recourse
to his mother, who demands an explanation of the bride, and elicits a
confession that she had once upon a time encountered a young man in a
wood, who subjected her to violence. Before they parted, he gave her
certain tokens, which he enjoined her to be very careful of, a lock of
his hair, a string of beads, a gold ring, and a knife. #B# omits the
knife, and #C# the beads. The mother goes back to her son, and asks what
he had done with the tokens she had charged him never to part with. He
owns that he had presented them to a lady, one whom he would now give
all his possessions to have for his wife. The lady of the greenwood is
identified by the tokens.

#A#, #C#, and #D# make the mother set a golden chair for the bride, in
which none but a maid can sit, #D# [no leal maid will sit till bidden,
#C#]. In #D# the chair is declined; in #C#, taken without bidding; in
#A# the significance of the chair has been lost. #E#, #F#, #G# employ no
kind of test of maidenhood,--the bride frankly avows that she is with
child to another man; and #D#, as well as #E#, #F#, #G#, omits the
substitution of the chambermaid. The tokens in #D# are a chain, a ring,
and three locks of hair; in #E#, gloves and a ring; in #F#, #G#, green
gloves, a ring, and three locks [plaits] of hair. Only the ring remains
in #H#.

"This ballad," says Motherwell (1827), "is very popular, and is known to
reciters under a variety of names. I have heard it called Lord Bangwell,
Bengwill, Dingwall, Brengwill, etc., and The Seven Sisters, or the
Leaves of Lind." He adds: "There is an unedited ballad in Scotland,
which is a nearer approximation to the Danish song, inasmuch as the
substitution of the maiden sister for the real bride constitutes a
prominent feature of the tale."[94] (Minstrelsy, Introduction, lxix^21
and xc.)

Scott remarks that Cospatrick[95] "was the designation of the Earl of
Dunbar, in the days of Wallace and Bruce." Mr Macmath informs me that it
is in use at the present day in the families of the Earl of Home and of
Dunbar of Mochrum, Bart, who, among others, claim descent from the
ancient earls of Dunbar and March. The story of the ballad might, of
course, attach itself to any person prominent in the region where the
ballad was known.

#Swedish.# Three Swedish versions of this ballad were given by Afzelius:
#A#, 'Riddar Olle' in 50 two-line stanzas, II, 217; #B#, 19 two-line
stanzas, II, 59; #C#, 19 two-line stanzas, II, 56: No 33, I, 175-182 of
Bergstr[:o]m's edition. Besides these, there are two fragments in Cavallius
and Stephens's unprinted collection: #D#, 6 stanzas; #E#, 7 stanzas, the
latter printed in Grundtvig, V, 307.[96] All these were obtained from
recitation in the present century. #A# comes nearest to our #A#, #B#.
Like Scottish #B#, it seems to have been compounded from several copies.
Sir Olof betrothed Ingalilla, and carried her home for the spousal,
wearing a red gold crown and a wan cheek. Ingalilla gave birth to
twin-boys. Olof had a maid who resembled Ingalilla completely, and who,
upon Ingalilla's entreaty, consented to play the part of bride on the
morrow. Dressed in Ingalilla's clothes, blue kirtle, green jacket, etc.,
and wearing five gold rings and a gold crown, the maid rode to church,
with Ingalilla at her back, and her beauty was admired by all as she
came and went. But outside of the church were a good many musicians; and
one of these piped out, "God-a-mercy, Ingalilla, no maid art thou!"
Ingalilla threw into the piper's hand something which made him change
his tune. He was an old drunken fellow, and no one need mind what he
sang. After five days of drinking, they took the bride to her chamber,
not without force. Ingalilla bore the light before her, and helped put
her to bed; then lay down herself. Olof had over him a fur rug, which
could talk as well as he, and it called out,

    'Hear me, Sir Olof, hear what I say;
    Thou hast taken a strumpet, and missed a may.'

And Olof,

    'Hear, little Inga, sweetheart,' he said;
    'What didst thou get for thy maidenhead?'[97]

Inga explained. Her father was a strange sort of man, and built her
bower by the sea-strand, where all the king's courtiers took ship. Nine
had broken in, and one had robbed her of her honor. He had given her an
embroidered sark, a blue kirtle, green jacket, black mantle, gloves,
five gold rings, a red gold crown, a golden harp, and a silver-mounted
knife, which she now wishes in the youngster's body. The conclusion is
abruptly told in two stanzas. Olof bids Inga not to talk so, for he is
father of her children. He embraces her and gives her a queen's crown
and name. #B# has the same story, omitting the incident of the musician.
#C# has preserved this circumstance, but has lost both the substitution
of the waiting-woman for the bride and the magical coverlet. #D# has
also lost these important features of the original story; #E# has
retained them.

#Danish.# 'Brud ikke M[/o],' Grundtvig, No 274, V, 304. There are two old
versions (more properly only one, so close is the agreement), and a
third from recent tradition. This last, Grundtvig's #C#, from Jutland,
1856, seems to be of Swedish origin, and, like Swedish #C#, #D#, wants
the talking coverlet, though it has kept the other material feature,
that of the substitution. #A# is found in two manuscripts, one of the
sixteenth and the other of the seventeenth century. #B# is the
well-known 'Ingefred og Gudrune,' or 'Herr Samsings Nattergale,' Syv,
IV, No 62, Danske Viser, No 194, translated in Jamieson's Illustrations,
p. 340, and by Prior, III, 347. A later form of #B#, from recent
recitation, 1868, is given in Kristensen's Jydske Folkeviser, I, No 53.

The story in #A# runs thus: S[/o]lverlad and Vendelrod [Ingefred and
Gudrune] were sitting together, and Vendelrod wept sorely. S[/o]lverlad
asked her sister the reason, and was told there was cause. Would she be
bride one night? Vendelrod would give her wedding clothes and all her
outfit. But S[/o]lverlad asked for bridegroom too, and Vendelrod would not
give up her bridegroom, happen what might. She went to church and was
married to Samsing. On the way from church they met a spaeman [#B#,
shepherd], who warned Vendelrod that Samsing had some nightingales that
could tell him whether he had married a maid or no. The sisters turned
aside and changed clothes, but could not change cheeks! S[/o]lverlad was
conducted to Samsing's house and placed on the bride bench. An unlucky
jester called out, "Methinks this is not Vendelrod!" but a gold ring
adroitly thrown into his bosom opened his eyes still wider, and made him
pretend he had meant nothing. The supposed bride is put to bed. Samsing
invokes his nightingales: "Have I a maid or no?" They reply, it is a
maid that lies in the bed, but Vendelrod stands on the floor. Samsing
asks Vendelrod why she avoided her bed, and she answers: her father
lived on the strand; her bower was broken into by a large company of
men, and one of them robbed her of her honor. In this case there are no
tokens for evidence. Samsing owns immediately that he and his men had
broken into the bower, and Vendelrod's agony is over.

Some of the usual tokens, gold harp, sark, shoes, and silver-mounted
knife, are found in the later #C#. Danish #D# is but a single initial
stanza.

Besides S[/o]lverlad and Vendelrod, there is a considerable number of
Danish ballads characterized by the feature that a bride is not a maid,
and most or all of these have similarities to 'Gil Brenton.' 'Hr. Find
og Vendelrod,' Grundtvig, No 275, has even the talking blanket
(sometimes misunderstood to be a bed-_board_). In this piece there is no
substitution. Vendelrod gives birth to children, and the news makes Find
jump over the table. Still he puts the question mildly, who is the
father, and recognizes that he is the man, upon hearing the story of the
bower on the strand, and seeing half a gold ring which Vendelrod had
received "for her honor."

In 'Ingelilles Bryllup,' Grundtvig, No 276, Blidelild is induced to take
Ingelild's place by the promise that she shall marry Ingelild's brother.
Hr. Magnus asks her why she is so sad, and says he knows she is not a
maid. Blidelild says, "Since you know so much, I will tell you more,"
and relates Ingelild's adventure,--how she had gone out to the river,
and nine knights came riding by, etc. [so #A#; in #B# and #C# we have
the bower on the strand, as before]. Hr. Magnus avows that he was the
ninth, who stayed when eight rode away. Blidelild begs that he will
allow her to go and look for some lost rings, and uses the opportunity
to send back Ingelild in her stead.

Various other Scandinavian ballads have more or less of the story of
those which have been mentioned. In the Danish 'Brud i Vaande,'
Grundtvig, No 277, a bride is taken with untimely pains while being
"brought home." The question asked in several of the Scottish ballads,
whether the saddle is uncomfortable, occurs in #A#, #B#; the bower that
was forced by eight swains and a knight in #A#, #C#, #D#, #F#; the gifts
in #A#, #B#, #F#; and an express acknowledgment of the act of violence
by the bridegroom in #A#, #B#, #D#. We find all of these traits except
the first in the corresponding Swedish ballad 'Herr [:A]ster och Fr[:o]ken
Sissa,' Afzelius, No 38, new ed., No 32,^1; the saddle and broken
bower in Swedish #D#, Grundtvig, No 277, Bilag 1; only the saddle in
Swedish #F#, Grundtvig, No. 277, Bilag 3, and #C#, Arwidsson, No 132;
the saddle and gifts in Icelandic #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#, #E#, Grundtvig, No
277, Bilag 5, 6, 7, 8.

'Peder og Malfred,' Grundtvig, No 278, in four versions, the oldest from
a manuscript of 1630, represents Sir Peter as riding away from home
about a month after his marriage, and meeting a woman who informs him
that there is a birth in his house. He returns, and asks who is the
father. Sir Peter satisfies himself that he is the man by identifying
the gifts, in #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#; and in #A#, #B# we have also the bower
by the strand.

In 'Oluf og Ellinsborg,' Grundtvig, No 279, #A#, #B#, #C#, one of the
queen's ladies is habitually sad, and is pressed by her lover to account
for this. She endeavors to put him off with fictitious reasons, but
finally nerves herself to tell the truth: she was walking by herself in
her orchard, when five knights came riding by, and one was the cause of
her grief. Oluf owns it was all his doing. A Swedish ballad, remarkably
close to the Danish, from a manuscript of the date 1572 (the oldest
Danish version is also from a manuscript of the 16th century), is
'Riddar Lage och Stolts Elensborg,' Arwidsson, No 56.

'Iver Hr. Jons[/o]n,' Grundtvig, No 280, in five versions, the oldest of
the 16th century, exhibits a lady as fearing the arrival of her lover's
ship, and sending her mother to meet him, while she takes to her bed.
Immediately upon her betrothed's entering her chamber, she abruptly
discloses the cause of her trouble. Eight men had broken into her bower
on the strand, and the ninth deprived her of her honor. Iver Hr. Jons[/o]n,
with as little delay, confesses that he was the culprit, and makes
prompt arrangements for the wedding.

There is another series of ballads, represented by 'Leesome Brand' in
English, and by 'Redselille og Medelvold' in Danish, which describe a
young woman, who is on the point of becoming a mother, as compelled to
go off on horseback with her lover, and suffering from the ride. We find
the question, whether the saddle is too narrow or the way too long, in
the Danish 'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L[/o]n,' Grundtvig, 270, 'Redselille og
Medelvold,' Grundtvig, 271 #C#, #D#, #E#, #I#, #K#, #L#, #M#, #P#, #Q#,
#V#, #Y#, and the Norwegian versions, #A#, #D#, #E#, #F#, of 'S[/o]nnens
Sorg,' Grundtvig, 272, Bilag 1, 4, 5, 6.[98] The gifts also occur in
Grundtvig's 271 #A#, #Z#, and Norwegian #D#, Bilag 9.

Perhaps no set of incidents is repeated so often in northern ballads as
the forcing of the bower on the strand, the giving of keepsakes, the
self-identification of the ravisher through these, and his full and
hearty reparation. All or some of these traits are found in many ballads
besides those belonging to the groups here spoken of: as 'Hildebrand og
Hilde,' #E#, #I#, Grundtvig, No 83, and Norwegian #A#, III, 857;
'Guldsmedens Datter,' Grundtvig, 245, and its Swedish counterpart at p.
481 of the preface to the same, and in Eva Wigstr[:o]m's Folkdiktning, p.
37, No 18; 'Liden Kirstins Dans,' Grundtvig, 263 (translated by Prior,
112), and Norwegian #B#, #C#, Bilag 2, 3; 'Jomfruens Harpesl[ae]t,'
Grundtvig, 265 (translated by Jamieson, 'Illustrations,' p. 382, Prior,
123, Buchanan, p. 6), and Swedish #D#, Bilag 2, Swedish #A#, Afzelius,
81. So Landstad, 42, 45; Arwidsson, 141; Grundtvig, 37 #G#; 38 #A#, #D#;

A very pretty Norwegian tale has for the talisman a stepping-stone at
the side of the bed: Asbj[/o]rnsen og Moe, No 29, 'Vesle Aase Gaasepige,'
Dasent, 2d ed., p. 478. An English prince had pictures taken of all the
handsomest princesses, to pick his bride by. When the chosen one
arrived, Aase the goose-girl informed her that the stone at the bedside
knew everything and told the prince; so if she felt uneasy on any
account, she must not step on it. The princess begged Aase to take her
place till the prince was fast asleep, and then they would change. When
Aase came and put her foot on the stone, the prince asked, "Who is it
that is stepping into my bed?" "A maid clean and pure," answered the
stone. By and by the princess came and took Aase's place. When they were
getting up in the morning, the prince asked again, "Who is it stepping
out of my bed?" "One that has had three children," said the stone. The
prince sent his first choice away, and tried a second. Aase faithfully
warned her, and she had cause for heeding the advice. When Aase stepped
in, the stone said it was a maid clean and pure; when the princess
stepped out, the stone said it was one that had had six children. The
prince was longer in hitting on a third choice. Aase took the bride's
place once more, but this time the prince put a ring on her finger,
which was so tight that she could not get it off, for he saw that all
was not right. In the morning, when he asked, "Who is stepping out of my
bed?" the stone answered, "One that has had nine children." Then the
prince asked the stone to clear up the mystery, and it revealed how the
princesses had put little Aase in their place. The prince went straight
to Aase to see if she had the ring. She had tied a rag over her finger,
pretending she had cut it; but the prince soon had the rag off,
recognized his ring, and Aase got the prince, for the good reason that
so it was to be.

The artifice of substituting waiting-woman for bride has been thought
to be derived from the romance of Tristan, in which Brangwain [Brengain,
Brangaene] sacrifices herself for Isold: Scott's 'Sir Tristrem,' ii, 54;
Gottfried V. Strassburg, xviii, ed. Bechstein. Grundtvig truly remarks
that a borrowing by the romance from the popular ballad is as probable a
supposition as the converse; and that, even should we grant the name of
the hero of the ballad to be a reminiscence of that of Isold's attendant
(e. g. Brangwill of Brangwain), nothing follows as to the priority of
the romance in respect to this passage. A similar artifice is employed
in the ballad of 'Torkild Trundeson,' Danske Viser, 200 (translated by
Prior, 100); Afzelius, II, 86, from the Danish; Arwidsson, 36. The
resemblance is close to 'Ingelilles Bryllup,' #C#, Grundtvig, 276. See
also, further on, 'The Twa Knights.'

The Billie Blin presents himself in at least four Scottish ballads:
'Gil Brenton,' #C#; 'Willie's Lady;' one version of 'Young Beichan;'
two of 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter;' and also in the English
ballad of 'King Arthur and the King of Cornwall,' here under the
slightly disfigured name of Burlow Beanie.[99] In all he is a
serviceable household demon; of a decidedly benignant disposition
in the first four, and, though a loathly fiend with seven heads in
the last, very obedient and useful when once thoroughly subdued. He
is clearly of the same nature as the Dutch _belewitte_ and German
_bilwiz_, characterized by Grimm as a friendly domestic genius,
_penas_, _guote holde_; and the names are actually associated in a
passage cited by Grimm from Voet: "De illis quos nostrates appellant
_beeldwit et blinde belien_, a quibus nocturna visa videri atque
ex iis arcana revelari putant."[100] Though the etymology of these
words is not unencumbered with difficulty, _bil_ seems to point to
a just and kindly-tempered being. Bilv['i]s, in the seventh book of
Saxo Grammaticus, is an aged counsellor whose bent is to make peace,
while his brother B[:o]lv['i]s, a blind man, is a strife-breeder
and mischief-maker.[101] The same opposition of Bil and B[:o]l
apparently occurs in the Edda, Gr['i]mnism['a]l, 47^4, where Bil-eygr
and B[:o]l-eygr (Bal-eygr) are appellatives of Odin, which may
signify mild-eyed and evil-eyed. B[:o]lv['i]s is found again in the
Hr[^o]mund's saga, under the description of 'Blind the Bad,' and 'the
Carl Blind whose name was Bav['i]s.' But much of this saga is taken
from the story of Helgi Hundingslayer; and Blind the Bad in the saga is
only S[ae]mund's Blindr inn b[:o]lv['i]si,--the blind man whose baleful
wit sees through the disguise of Helgi, and all but betrays the rash
hero to his enemies; that is, Odin in his malicious mood (B[:o]lverkr),
who will presently be seen in the ballad of 'Earl Brand' masking as Old
Carl Hood, "aye for ill and never for good." Originally and properly,
perhaps, only the bad member of this mythical pair is blind; but it
would not be at all strange that later tradition, which confuses and
degrades so much in the old mythology, should transfer blindness to
the good-natured one, and give rise to the anomalous Billie Blind. See

It has been suggested to me that "the Haleigh throw" in #E# 6 is a

    'I gae them a' to a ladye gay

    Now or a month was cum and gane,
    The ladye bore a bonny son.

    1
    We were sisters, we were seven,
    We were the fairest under heaven.

    2
    And it was a' our seven years wark
    To sew our father's seven sarks.

    3
    And whan our seven years wark was done,
    We laid it out upo the green.

    4
    We coost the lotties us amang,
    Wha wad to the greenwood gang,

    5
    To pu the lily but and the rose,
    To strew witha' our sisters' bowers.

    6
    ... I was youngest,
    ... my weer was hardest.

    7
    And to the greenwood I bud gae,
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    8
    There I met a handsome childe,
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    9
    High-coled stockings and laigh-coled shoon,
    He bore him like a king's son.

    10
    An was I weel, or was I wae,
    He keepit me a' the simmer day.

    11
    An though I for my hame-gaun sich[t],
    He keepit me a' the simmer night.

    12
    He gae to me a gay gold ring,
    And bade me keep it aboon a' thing.

    13
    He gae to me a cuttie knife,
    And bade me keep it as my life:

    14
    Three lauchters o his yellow hair,
    For fear we wad neer meet mair.

    15
    Next there came shippes three,
    To carry a' my bridal fee.

    16
    Gowd were the beaks, the sails were silk,
    Wrought wi maids' hands like milk.

    17
    They came toom and light to me,
    But heavie went they waie frae me.

    18
    They were fu o baken bread,
    They were fu of wine sae red.

    19
    My dowry went a' by the sea,
    But I gaed by the grenewode tree.

    20
    An I sighed and made great mane,
    As thro the grenewode we rade our lane.

    21
    An I ay siched an wiped my ee,
    That eer the grenewode I did see.

    22
    'Is there water in your glove,
      Or win into your shoe?
    O[r] am I oer low a foot-page
      To rin by you, ladie?'

    23
    'O there's nae water in my glove,
      Nor win into my shoe;
    But I am maning for my mither
      Wha's far awa frae me.'

    24
    'Gin ye be a maiden fair,
    Meikle gude ye will get there.

    25
    'If ye be a maiden but,
    Meikle sorrow will ye get.

    26
    'For seven king's daughters he hath wedded,
    But never wi ane o them has bedded.

    27
    'He cuts the breasts frae their breast-bane,
    An sends them back unto their dame.

    28
    'He sets their backs unto the saddle,
    An sends them back unto their father.

    29
    'But be ye maiden or be ye nane,
    To the gowden chair ye draw right soon.

    30
    'But be ye leman or be ye maiden,
    Sit nae down till ye be bidden.'

    31
    Was she maiden or was she nane,
    To the gowden chair she drew right soon.

    32
    Was she leman or was she maiden,
    She sat down ere she was bidden.

    33
    Out then spake the lord's mother;
    Says, 'This is not a maiden fair.

    34
    'In that chair nae leal maiden
    Eer sits down till they be bidden.'

    35
    The Billie Blin then outspake he,
    As he stood by the fair ladie.

    36
    'The bonnie may is tired wi riding,
    Gaurd her sit down ere she was bidden.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    37
    But on her waiting-maid she ca'd:
      'Fair ladie, what 's your will wi me?'
    'O ye maun gie yere maidenheid
      This night to an unco lord for me.'

    38
    'I hae been east, I hae been west,
      I hae been far beyond the sea,
    But ay, by grenewode or by bower,
      I hae keepit my virginitie.

    39
    'But will it for my ladie plead,
    I'll gie 't this night to an unco lord.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    40
    When bells were rung an vespers sung,
    An men in sleep were locked soun,

    41
    Childe Branton and the waiting-maid
    Into the bridal bed were laid.

    42
    'O lie thee down, my fair ladie,
    Here are a' things meet for thee;

    43
    'Here's a bolster for yere head,
    Here is sheets an comelie weids.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    44
    'Now tell to me, ye Billie Blin,
    If this fair dame be a leal maiden.'

    45
    'I wat she is as leal a wight
    As the moon shines on in a simmer night.

    46
    'I wat she is as leal a may
    As the sun shines on in a simmer day.

    47
    'But your bonnie bride's in her bower,
    Dreeing the mither's trying hour.'

    48
    Then out o his bridal bed he sprang,
    An into his mither's bower he ran.

    49
    'O mither kind, O mither dear,
    This is nae a maiden fair.

    50
    'The maiden I took to my bride
    Has a bairn atween her sides.

    51
    'The maiden I took to my bower
    Is dreeing the mither's trying hour.'

    52
    Then to the chamber his mother flew,
    And to the wa the door she threw.

    53
    She stapt at neither bolt nor ban,
    Till to that ladie's bed she wan.

    54
    Says, 'Ladie fair, sae meek an mild,
    Wha is the father o yere child?'

    55
    'O mither dear,' said that ladie,
    'I canna tell gif I sud die.

    Break up the coffer, an there ye'll see.'

    70
    An ay she coost, an ay she flang,
    Till her ain gowd ring came in her hand.

    71
    And scarce aught i the coffer she left,
    Till she gat the knife wi the siller heft,

    72
    Three lauchters o his yellow hair,
    Knotted wi ribbons dink and rare.

    80
    Then to his ladie fast ran he,
    An low he kneeled on his knee.

    81
    'O tauk ye up my son,' said he,
    'An, mither, tent my fair ladie.

    84
    It was weel written on his breast-bane
    Childe Branton was the father's name.

    We were sisters, sisters seven,
      Bowing down, bowing down
    The fairest women under heaven.
      And aye the birks a-bowing

    And on the youngest it did fa.

    4
    Now she must to the grenewood gang,
    To pu the nuts in grenewood hang.

    5
    She hadna tarried an hour but ane
    Till she met wi a highlan groom.

    6
    He keeped her sae late and lang
    Till the evening set and birds they sang.

    7
    He gae to her at their parting
    A chain o gold and gay gold ring;

    8
    And three locks o his yellow hair;
    Bade her keep them for evermair.

    9
    When six lang months were come and gane,
    A courtier to this lady came.

    10
    Lord Dingwall courted this lady gay,
    And so he set their wedding-day.

    11
    A little boy to the ha was sent,
    To bring her horse was his intent.

    12
    As she was riding the way along,
    She began to make a heavy moan.

    13
    'What ails you, lady,' the boy said,
    'That ye seem sae dissatisfied?

    14
    'Are the bridle reins for you too strong?
    Or the stirrups for you too long?'

    15
    'But, little boy, will ye tell me
    The fashions that are in your countrie?'

    16
    'The fashions in our ha I'll tell,
    And o them a' I'll warn you well.

    17
    'When ye come in upon the floor,
    His mither will meet you wi a golden chair.

    18
    'But be ye maid or be ye nane,
    Unto the high seat make ye boun.

    19
    'Lord Dingwall aft has been beguild
    By girls whom young men hae defiled.

    20
    'He's cutted the paps frae their breast-bane,
    And sent them back to their ain hame.'

    21
    When she came in upon the floor,
    His mother met her wi a golden chair.

    22
    But to the high seat she made her boun:
    She knew that maiden she was nane.

    23
    When night was come, they went to bed,
    And ower her breast his arm he laid.

    24
    He quickly jumped upon the floor,
    And said, 'I've got a vile rank whore.'

    25
    Unto his mother he made his moan,
    Says, 'Mother dear, I am undone.

    26
    'Ye've aft tald, when I brought them hame,
    Whether they were maid or nane.

    27
    'I thought I'd gotten a maiden bright;
    I've gotten but a waefu wight.

    28
    'I thought I'd gotten a maiden clear,
    But gotten but a vile rank whore.'

    29
    'When she came in upon the floor,
    I met her wi a golden chair.

    30
    'But to the high seat she made her boun,
    Because a maiden she was nane.'

    31
    'I wonder wha 's tauld that gay ladie
    The fashion into our countrie.'

    32
    'It is your little boy I blame,
    Whom ye did send to bring her hame.'

    33
    Then to the lady she did go,
    And said, 'O Lady, let me know

    34
    'Who has defiled your fair bodie:
    Ye're the first that has beguiled me.'

    35
    'O we were sisters, sisters seven,
    The fairest women under heaven.

    36
    'And we kiest kevels us amang,
    Wha woud to the grenewood gang;

    37
    'For to pu the finest flowers,
    To put around our summer bowers.

    38
    'I was the youngest o them a';
    The hardest fortune did me befa.

    39
    'Unto the grenewood I did gang,
    And pu'd the nuts as they down hang.

    40
    'I hadna stayd an hour but ane
    Till I met wi a highlan groom.

    41
    'He keeped me sae late and lang
    Till the evening set and birds they sang.

    42
    'He gae to me at our parting
    A chain of gold and gay gold ring;

    43
    'And three locks o his yellow hair;
    Bade me keep them for evermair.

    44
    'Then for to show I make nae lie,
    Look ye my trunk, and ye will see.'

    45
    Unto the trunk then she did go,
    To see if that were true or no.

    46
    And aye she sought, and aye she flang,
    Till these four things came to her hand.

    47
    Then she did to her ain son go,
    And said, 'My son, ye'll let me know,

    48
    'Ye will tell to me this thing:
    What did you wi my wedding-ring?'

    49
    'Mother dear, I'll tell nae lie:
    I gave it to a gay ladie.

    50
    'I would gie a' my ha's and towers,
    I had this bird within my bowers.'

    51
    'Keep well, keep well your lands and strands;
    Ye hae that bird within your hands.

    52
    'Now, my son, to your bower ye'll go:
    Comfort your ladie, she's full o woe.'

    53
    Now when nine months were come and gane,
    The lady she brought hame a son.

    54
    It was written on his breast-bane
    Lord Dingwall was his father's name.

    55
    He's taen his young son in his arms,
    And aye he praisd his lovely charms.

    56
    And he has gien him kisses three,
    And doubled them ower to his ladie.

    He's taken with him all his merry men.
      Hey, etc.

    2
    As he was walking late alone,
    He spyed a lady both brisk and young.

    3
    He keeped her so long and long,
    From the evening late till the morning came.

    4
    All that he gave her at their parting
    Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring.

    5
    Lord Benwall he's a wooing gone,
    And he's taken with him all his merry men.

    6
    As he was walking the Haleigh throw,
    He spy'd seven ladyes all in a row.

    7
    He cast a lot among them all;
    Upon the youngest the lot did fall.

    8
    He wedded her and brought her home,
    And by the way she made great moan.

    9
    'What aileth my dearest and dayly flower?
    What ails my dear, to make such moan?

    10
    'Does the steed carry you too high?
    Or does thy pillow sit awry?

    11
    'Or does the wind blow in thy glove?
    Or is thy heart after another love?'

    12
    'The steed does not carry me too high,
    Nor does my pillow sit awry.

    13
    'Nor does the wind blow in my glove,
    Nor is my heart after another love.'

    14
    When they were doun to supper set,
    The weary pain took her by the back.

    15
    'What ails my dearest and dayly flower?
    What ails my dearest, to make such moan?'

    16
    'I am with child, and it's not to thee,
    And oh and alas, what shall I doe!'

    17
    'I thought I had got a maid so mild;
    But I have got a woman big with child.

    18
    'I thought I had got a dayly flower;
    I have gotten but a common whore.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    19
    'Rise up, Lord Benwall, go to your hall,
    And cherrish up your merry men all.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    20
    'As I was walking once late alone,
    I spy'd a lord, both brisk and young.

    21
    'He keeped me so long and long,
    From the evening late till the morning came.

    22
    'All that he gave me at our parting
    Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring.

    23
    'If you will not believe what I tell to thee,
    There's the key of my coffer, you may go and see.'

    24
    His mother went, and threw and flang,
    Till to her hand the ring it came.

    25
    'Lord Benwall, wilt thou tell to me
    Where is the ring I gave to thee?'

    26
    'Now I would give all my lands and tower,
    To have that lady in my bower.

    27
    'I would give all my lands and rents,
    To have that lady in my tents.'

    28
    'You need not give all your lands and tower,
    For you have that lady in your power.

    29
    'You need not give all your lands and rents,
    For you have that lady in your tents.'

    30
    Now it was written on the child's breast-bone
    Lord Benwall's sirname and his name.

    31
    It was written on the child's right hand
    That he should be heir of Lord Benwall's land.

    'Canst cloath my lady in the silk,
    And feed my young son with the milk.'

        Thomson, February, 1825. #b.# Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
        Appendix, p. xvi, the first stanza only.

    1
    There were three sisters in a bouir,
      Eh down and Oh down
    And the youngest o them was the fairest flour.
      Eh down and O down

    2
    And we began our seven years wark,
    To sew our brither John a sark.

    3
    When seven years was come and gane,
    There was nae a sleeve in it but ane.

    4
    But we coost kevils us amang
    Wha wud to the green-wood gang.

    5
    But tho we had coosten neer sae lang,
    The lot it fell on me aye to gang.

    6
    I was the youngest, and I was the fairest,
    And alace! my wierd it was aye the sairest.

    7
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    Till I had to the woods to gae.

    8
    To pull the cherrie and the slae,
    And to seek our ae brither, we had nae mae.

    9
    But as I was walking the leas o Lyne,
    I met a youth gallant and fine;

    10
    Wi milk white stockings and coal black shoon;
    He seemed to be some gay lord's son.

    11
    But he keepit me there sae lang, sae lang,
    Till the maids in the morning were singing their sang.

    12
    Would I wee or would I way,
    He keepit me the lang simmer day.

    13
    Would I way or would I wight,
    He keepit me the simmer night.

    14
    But guess what was at our parting?
    A pair o grass green gloves and a gay gold ring.

    15
    He gave me three plaits o his yellow hair,
    In token that we might meet mair.

    16
    But when nine months were come and gane,
    This gallant lord cam back again.

    17
    He's wed this lady, and taen her wi him;
    But as they were riding the leas o Lyne,

    18
    This lady was not able to ride,
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    19
    'O does thy saddle set thee aside?
    Or does thy steed ony wrang way ride?

    20
    'Or thinkst thou me too low a groom?
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    21
    'Or hast thou musing in thy mind
    For the leaving of thy mother kind?'

    22
    'My saddle it sets not me aside,
    Nor does my steed ony wrang way ride.

    23
    'Nor think I thee too low a groom
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    24
    'But I hae musing in my mind
    For the leaving of my mother kind.'

    25
    'I'll bring thee to a mother of mine,
    As good a mother as eer was thine.'

    26
    'A better mother she may be,
    But an unco woman she'll prove to me.'

    27
    But when lords and ladies at supper sat,
    Her pains they struck her in the back.

    28
    When lords and ladies were laid in bed,
    Her pains they struck her in the side.

    29
    'Rise up, rise up, now, Lord Brangwill,
    For I'm wi child and you do not know't.'

    30
    He took up his foot and gave her sic a bang
    Till owre the bed the red blood sprang.

    31
    He is up to his mother's ha,
    Calling her as hard as he could ca.

    32
    'I went through moss and I went through mure,
    Thinking to get some lily flouir.

    33
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    'But to my house I have brocht a hure.

    34
    'I thocht to have got a lady baith meek and mild,
    But I've got a woman that's big wi child.'

    35
    'O rest you here, Lord Brangwill,' she said,
    'Till I relieve your lady that lyes so low.'

    36
    'O daughter dear, will you tell to me
    Who is the father of your babie?'

    37
    'Yes, mother dear, I will tell thee
    Who is the father of my babie.

    38
    'As I was walking the leas o Lyne,
    I met a youth gallant and fine;

    39
    'With milk-white stockings and coal-black shoon;
    He seemd to be sum gay lord's son.

    40
    'He keepit me sae lang, sae lang,
    Till the maids in the morning were singing their sang.

    41
    'Would I wee or would I way,
    He keepit me the lang simmer day.

    42
    'Would I way or would I wight,
    He keepit me the simmer night.

    43
    'But guess ye what was at our parting?
    A pair of grass green gloves and a gay gold ring.

    44
    'He gave me three plaits o his yellow hair,
    In token that we might meet mair.'

    45
    'O dochter dear, will ye show me
    These tokens that he gave to thee?'

    46
    'Altho my back should break in three,
    Unto my coffer I must be.'

    47
    'Thy back it shall not break in three,
    For I'll bring thy coffer to thy knee.'

    48
    Aye she coost, and aye she flang,
    Till these three tokens came to her hand.

    49
    Then she is up to her son's ha,
    Calling him hard as she could ca.

    50
    'O son, O son, will you tell me
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    51
    'What ye did wi the grass green gloves and gay gold ring
    That ye gat at your own birth-een?'

    52
    'I gave them to as pretty a may
    As ever I saw in a simmer day.

    53
    'I wud rather than a' my lands sae broad
    That I had her as sure as eer I had.

    54
    'I would rather than a' my lands sae free
    I had her here this night wi me.'

    55
    'I wish you good o your lands sae broad,
    For ye have her as sure as eer ye had.

    56
    'I wish ye good o your lands sae free,
    For ye have her here this night wi thee.'

    57
    'Gar wash my auld son in the milk,
    Gar deck my lady's bed wi silk.'

    58
    He gave his auld son kisses three,
    But he doubled them a' to his gay ladye.

    As Bothwell was walking in the lowlands alane,
      Hey down and a down
    He met six ladies sae gallant and fine.
      Hey down and a down

    2
    He cast his lot amang them a',
    And on the youngest his lot did fa.

    3
    He's brought her frae her mother's bower,
    Unto his strongest castle and tower.

    4
    But ay she cried and made great moan,
    And ay the tear came trickling down.

    5
    'Come up, come up,' said the foremost man,
    'I think our bride comes slowly on.'

    6
    'O lady, sits your saddle awry,
    Or is your steed for you owre high?'

    7
    'My saddle is not set awry,
    Nor carries me my steed owre high;

    8
    'But I am weary of my life,
    Since I maun be Lord Bothwell's wife.'

    9
    He's blawn his horn sae sharp and shrill,
    Up start the deer on evry hill.

    10
    He's blawn his horn sae lang and loud,
    Up start the deer in gude green-wood.

    11
    His lady mother lookit owre the castle wa,
    And she saw them riding ane and a'.

    12
    She's calld upon her maids by seven,
    To mak his bed baith saft and even.

    13
    She's calld upon her cooks by nine,
    To make their dinner fair and fine.

    14
    When day was gane, and night was come,
    'What ails my love on me to frown?

    15
    'Or does the wind blow in your glove?
    Or runs your mind on another love?'

    16
    'Nor blows the wind within my glove,
    Nor runs my mind on another love;

    17
    'But I nor maid nor maiden am,
    For I'm wi bairn to another man.'

    18
    'I thought I'd a maiden sae meek and sae mild,
    But I've nought but a woman wi child.'

    19
    His mother's taen her up to a tower,
    And lockit her in her secret bower.

    20
    'Now, doughter mine, come tell to me,
    Wha's bairn this is that you are wi.'

    21
    'O mother dear, I canna learn
    Wha is the faither of my bairn.

    22
    'But as I walkd in the lowlands my lane,
    I met a gentleman gallant and fine.

    23
    'He keepit me there sae late and sae lang,
    Frae the evning late till the morning dawn.

    24
    'And a' that he gied me to my propine
    Was a pair of green gloves and a gay gold ring;

    25
    'Three lauchters of his yellow hair,
    In case that we shoud meet nae mair.'

    26
    His lady mother went down the stair:
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .

    27
    'Now son, now son, come tell to me,
    Where's the green gloves I gave to thee?'

    28
    'I gied to a lady sae fair and so fine
    The green gloves and a gay gold ring.

    29
    'But I wad gie my castles and towers,
    I had that lady within my bowers.

    30
    'But I wad gie my very life,
    I had that lady to be my wife.'

    31
    'Now keep, now keep your castles and towers,
    You have that lady within your bowers.

    32
    'Now keep, now keep your very life,
    You have that lady to be your wife.'

[94] In his note-book, p. 117, Motherwell writes, with less than his
usual discretion: "The ballad of Bothwell, Cospatric, or Gil Brenton,
appears to be copied from an account of the birth of Makbeth given by
Wintown." The substance of this account is, that Macbeth's mother had a
habit of repairing to the woods for wholesome air, and that, during one
of her rambles, she fell in with a fair man, really the Devil, who
passed the day with her, and got on her a son.

    "And of that dede in taknyng
    He gave his lemman thare a ryng,
    And bad hyr that scho suld kepe that wele,
    And hald for hys luve that jwele."

                              _Cronykil_, Book VI, ch. xviii, 57-90.

[95] Scott says: "Cospatrick, Comes Patricius;" but Cos- (Gos-)patrick
is apparently Servant of Patrick, like Gil-patrick (Kil-patrick). Mr
Macmath suggests to me that Gil Brenton may have originally been
Gil-brandon, which seems very likely. See Notes and Queries, 5th S., x,
443.

[96] A fragment in Rancken's 'N[oa]gra Prof af Folks[oa]ng,' p. 14 f,
belongs not to 'Riddar Olle,' as there said, but to 'Herr [:A]ster och
Fr[:o]ken Sissa,' though the burden is 'Riddar Olof.' Other verses,
at p. 16, might belong to either. 'Riddar Ola,' E. Wigstr[:o]m's
Folkdiktning, p. 37, No 18, belongs with the Danish 'Guldsmedens
Datter,' Grundtvig No 245.

[97] The inquiry seems to refer to the morning gift. "Die Morgengabe ist
ein Geschenk des Mannes als Zeichen der Liebe (in signum amoris), f[:u]r
die Uebergabe der vollen Sch[:o]nheit (in honore pulchritudinis) und der
Jungfr[:a]ulichkeit (pretium virginitatis)." Weinhold, Die deutschen Frauen
in dem Mittelalter, S. 270.

[98] And again, "Is it the saddle, your horse, or your true-love?"
almost exactly as in our #B#, #E#, #F#, Grundtvig, 40 #C#, #E#, #F#,
Afzelius, 91, Landstad, 45, 52. So the Scottish ballad, 'The Cruel
Brother,' #B# 15 f.

[99] The auld belly-blind man in 'Earl Richard,' 44^3, 45^1, Kinloch's
A. S. Ballads, p. 15, retains the bare name; and Belly Blind, or Billie
Blin, is the Scotch name for the game of Blindman's-buff.

[101] Merlin, in Layamon, V. 17130 ff (as pointed out by Grundtvig, I,
274), says that his mind is balewise, "mi g[ae]st is b[ae]liwis," and
that he is not disposed to gladness, mirth, or good words.

WILLIE'S LADY

        #a.# 'Willie's Lady,' Fraser-Tytler MS.

        #b.# 'Sweet Willy,' Jamieson-Brown MS., No 15, fol. 33.


#a#, 'Willie's Lady,' was No 1 in the manuscript of fifteen ballads
furnished William Tytler by Mrs Brown in 1783, and having been written
down a little later than #b# may be regarded as a revised copy. This
manuscript, as remarked under No 5, is not now in the possession of the
Fraser-Tytler family, having often been most liberally lent, and,
probably, at last not returned. But a transcript had been made by the
grandfather of the present family of two of the pieces contained in it,
and 'Willie's Lady' is one of these two.

Lewis had access to William Tytler's copy, and, having regulated the
rhymes, filled out a gap, dropped the passage about the girdle, and made
other changes to his taste, printed the ballad in 1801 as No 56 of his
Tales of Wonder. The next year Scott gave the "ancient copy, never
before published," "in its native simplicity, as taken from Mrs Brown of
Falkland's MS.,"--William Tytler's,--in Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, II, 27, but not with literal accuracy. Jamieson, in 1806, gave
'Sweet Willy,' almost exactly according to the text of his Brown
manuscript, in an appendix to the second volume of his collection, p.
367, and at p. 175 of the same volume, a reconstruction of the ballad
which might have been spared.

#b# lacks altogether the passage which makes proffer of the cup, #a#,
stanzas 5-11, and substitutes at that place the girdle of #a# 21-28. The
woodbine in #a# 36, 41, is also wanting, and the concluding stanza. A
deficiency both in matter and rhyme at #a# 32, is supplied by #b# 25,
26, but not happily:

    'An do you to your mither then,
    An bid her come to your boy's christnen;

    'For dear's the boy he's been to you:
    Then notice well what she shall do.'

Again, the transition in #a#, from st. 33 to st. 34, is abrupt even for
a ballad, and #b# introduces here four stanzas narrating the execution
of the Billy Blind's injunctions, and ending,

    And notic'd well what she did say,

whereby we are prepared for the witch's exclamations.[102]

Danish versions of this ballad are numerous: #A-I#, 'Hustru og Mands
Moder' ['Fostermoder,' 'Stifmoder'], Grundtvig, No 84, II, 404 ff;
#J-T#, 'Hustru og Mands Moder,' Kristensen, II, 111 ff, No 35:
#U-X#,'Barselkvinden,' Kristensen, I, 201 ff, No 74; #Y#, 'Hustru og
Slegfred,' Grundtvig, No 85, II, 448 ff: in all twenty-five, but many of
Kristensen's copies are fragments. Grundtvig's 84 #A#, #B#, and 85 #a#
are from manuscripts of the sixteenth century. 84 #F-I# and several
repetitions of 85 are of the seventeenth. Grundtvig's 84 #C#, #D#, #E#,
and all Kristensen's versions, are from recent oral tradition. Some of
these, though taken down since 1870, are wonderfully well preserved.

The Danish ballads divide into two classes, principally distinguished by
their employing or not employing of the artifice of wax children. (There
is but one of these in #N#, #R#, Kristensen's #E#, #I#, II, 116, 122,
and in the oldest Swedish ballad, as in the Scottish: but children in
Scandinavian ballads are mostly born in pairs.) Of the former class, to
which our only known copy belongs, are #F-I#, #N-T#, #X# (Grundtvig, 84
#F-I#, Kristensen, II, No 35, #E-L#, I, No 74 #D#). #N# and #I# furnish,
perhaps, the most consistent story, which, in the former, runs thus: Sir
Peter married Ellen (elsewhere Mettelille, Kirstin, Tidelil, Ingerlil),
and gave her in charge to his mother, a formidable witch, and, as
appears from #F#, violently opposed to the match. The first night of her
marriage Ellen conceived twins. She wrapped up her head in her cloak and
paid a visit to her mother-in-law, to ask how long women go with child.
The answer was,

    'Forty weeks went Mary with Christ,
    And so each Danish woman must.

    'Forty weeks I went with mine,
    But eight years shalt thou go with thine.'

The forty weeks had passed, and Ellen began to long for relief. Sir
Peter besought aid of his sister Ingerlin. If I help your young bride,
she said, I must be traitor to my mother. Sir Peter insisted, and
Ingerlin moulded a fine child of wax,[103] wrapped it in linen, and
exhibited it to her mother, who, supposing that her arts had been
baffled, burst out into exclamations of astonishment. She had thought
she could twist a rope out of flying sand, lay sun and moon flat on the
earth with a single word, turn the whole world round about! She had
thought all the house was spell-bound, except the spot where the young
wife's chest stood, the chest of red rowan, which nothing can bewitch!
The chest was instantly taken away, and Ellen's bed moved to the place
it had occupied; and no sooner was this done than Ellen gave birth to
two children.

In the ballads of the other class, the young wife, grown desperate after
eight years of suffering, asks to be taken back to her maiden home. Her
husband's mother raises objections: the horses are in the meadow, the
coachman is in bed. Then, she says, I will go on my bare feet. The
moment her husband learns her wish, the carriage is at the door, but by
the arts of the mother it goes to pieces on the way, and the journey has
to be finished on horseback. The joy of her parents at seeing their
daughter approaching was quenched on a nearer view: she looked more dead
than quick. She called her family about her and distributed her effects.
A great wail went up in the house when two sons were cut from the
mother's side. (#C#, #J#, #K#, #L#, #W#: Grundtvig, 84 #C#; Kristensen,
II, No 35 #A#, #B#, #C#; I, No 74 #C#.)

    The first son stood up and brushed his hair:
    'Most surely am I in my ninth year.'

    The second stood up both fair and red:
    'Most sure we'll avenge our dear mother dead.'[104]

Several of the most important ballads of the first class have taken up a
part of the story of those of the second class, to the detriment of
consistency. #F#, #G#, #H#, #O#, #P# (Grundtvig, 84 #F#, #G#, #H#,
Kristensen, II, No 35 #F#, #G#), make the wife quit her husband's house
for her father's, not only without reason, but against reason. If the
woman is to die, it is natural enough that she should wish to die with
the friends of her early days, and away from her uncongenial
mother-in-law; but there is no kind of occasion for transferring the
scene of the trick with the wax children to her father's house; and, on
the other hand, it is altogether strange that her husband's mother and
the rowan-tree chest (which sometimes appears to be the property of the
mother, sometimes that of the wife) should go with her.

#Y#, 'Hustru og Slegfred,' Grundtvig, 85, agrees with the second class
up to the point when the wife is put to bed at her mother's house, but
with the important variation that the spell is the work of a former
mistress of the husband; instead of his mother, as in most of the
ballads, or of the wife's foster-mother, as in #C#, #D#, #J#, #K#, #M#
(Grundtvig, 84 #C#, #D#, Kristensen, II, No 35 #A#, #B#, #D#), or of the
wife's step-mother as in #A# only. The conclusion of 'Hustru og
Slegfred' is rather flat. The wife, as she lies in bed, bids all her
household hold up their hands and pray for her relief, which occurs on
the same day. The news is sent to her husband, who rejoins his wife, is
shown his children, praises God, and burns his mistress. Burning is also
the fate of the mother-in-law in #B#, #I#, #O#, #P#, whereas in #F# she
dies of chagrin, and in #G# bursts into a hundred flinders
(flentsteene).

This ballad, in the mixed form of #O#, #P# (Kristensen, II, 35 #F#,
#G#), has been resolved into a tale in Denmark, a few lines of verse
being retained. Recourse is had by the spell-bound wife to a cunning
woman in the village, who informs her that in her house there is a place
in which a rowan-tree chest has stood, and that she can get relief
there. The cunning woman subsequently pointing out the exact spot, two
boys are born, who are seven years old, and can both walk and talk. Word
is sent the witch that her son's wife has been delivered of two sons,
and that she herself shall be burned the day following. The witch says,
"I have been able to twine a string out of running water. If I have not
succeeded in bewitching the woman, she must have found the place where
the damned rowan chest stood." (Grundtvig, III, 858, No 84 #b#.)

Three Swedish versions of the ballad have been printed. #A#, #B#, from
tradition of this century, are given by Arwidsson, II, 252 ff, 'Liten
Kerstins F[:o]rtrollning,' No 134. These resemble the Danish ballads of the
second class closely. Liten Kerstin goes to her mother's house, gives
birth to two children, and dies. In #A# the children are a son and
daughter. The son stands up, combs his hair, and says, "I am forty weeks
on in my ninth year." He can run errands in the village, and the
daughter sew red silk. In #B# both children are boys. One combs his
hair, and says, "Our grandmother shall be put on two wheels." The other
draws his sword, and says, "Our mother is dead, our grandmother to
blame. I hope our mother is with God. Our grandmother shall be laid on
seven wheels." The other copy, #C#, mentioned by Grundtvig as being in
Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection, has been printed in the
Svenska Fornminnesf[:o]reningens Tidskrift, vol. ii, p. 72 ff, 1873-74. It
dates from the close of the sixteenth century, and resembles the mixed
ballads of the Danish first class, combining the flitting to the
father's house with the artifice of the wax children. The conclusion of
this ballad has suffered greatly. After the two sons are born, we are
told that Kirstin, before unmentioned, goes to the chest and makes a wax
child. If the chest were moved, Elin would be free of her child. And
then the boy stands up and brushes his hair, and says he has come to his
eighth year.

Three stanzas and some of the incidents of a #Norwegian# version of this
ballad have been communicated to Grundtvig, III, 858 f, No 84 c, by
Professor Sophus Bugge. The only place which was unaffected by a spell
was where Signel['i]ti's bride-chest stood, and the chest being removed,
the birth took place. The witch was a step-mother, as in Danish #A#.

There are two familiar cases of malicious arrest of childbirth in
classic mythology,--those of Latona and Alcmene. The wrath of Juno was
the cause in both, and perhaps the myth of Alcmene is only a repetition
of an older story, with change of name. The pangs of Latona were
prolonged through nine days and nights, at the end of which time
Ilithyia came to her relief, induced by a bribe. (Hymn to the Delian
Apollo, 91 ff.) Homer, Il. xix, 119, says only that Hera stopped the
delivery of Alcmene and kept back Ilithyia. Antoninus Liberalis, in the
second century of our era, in one of his abstracts from the
Metamorphoses of Nicander, a poem of the second century B. C., or
earlier, has this account: that when Alcmene was going with Hercules,
the Fates and Ilithyia, to please Juno, kept her in her pains by sitting
down and folding their hands; and that Galinthias, a playmate and
companion of Alcmene, fearing that the suffering would drive her mad,
ran out and announced the birth of a boy, upon which the Fates were
seized with such consternation that they let go their hands, and
Hercules immediately came into the world. (Antoninus Lib., Metam. c.
xxix.) Ovid, Metamorphoses, ix, 281-315, is more circumstantial. After
seven days and nights of torture, Lucina came, but, being bribed by
Juno, instead of giving the aid for which she was invoked, sat down on
the altar before Alcmene's door, with the right knee crossed over the
left, and fingers interlocked, mumbling charms which checked the
processes of birth. Galanthis, a servant girl _media de plebe_, was
shrewd enough to suspect that Juno had some part in this mischief; and
besides, as she went in and out of the house, she always saw Lucina
sitting on the altar, with her hands clasped over her knees. At last, by
a happy thought, she called out, "Whoever you are, wish my mistress joy;
she is lighter, and has her wish." Lucina jumped up and unclasped her
hands, and the birth followed instantly. Pausanias, ix, 11, tells a
similar but briefer story, in which Historis, daughter of Tiresias,
takes the place of Galanthis. See, for the whole matter, 'Ilithyia oder
die Hexe,' in C. A. B[:o]ttiger's Kleine Schriften, I, 76 ff.

Apuleius, in his Metamorphoses, mentions a case of suspended childbirth,
which, curiously enough, had lasted eight years,[105] as in the Danish
and Swedish ballads. The witch is a mistress of her victim's husband, as
in Grundtvig, 85, and as in a story cited by Scott from Heywood's
'Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels,' p. 474. "There is a curious tale
about a Count of Westeravia [Vestravia, in diocesi Argentoratensi], whom
a deserted concubine bewitched upon his marriage, so as to preclude all
hopes of his becoming a father. The spell continued to operate for three
years, till one day, the count happening to meet with his former
mistress, she maliciously asked him about the increase of his family.
The count, conceiving some suspicion from her manner, craftily answered
that God had blessed him with three fine children; on which she
exclaimed, like Willie's mother in the ballad, 'May Heaven confound the
old hag by whose counsel I threw an enchanted pitcher into the draw-well
of your palace!' The spell being found and destroyed, the count became
the father of a numerous family."

A story like that of the ballad is told as a fact that took place in
Arran within this century. A young man forsook his sweetheart and
married another girl. When the wife's time came, she suffered
excessively. A pack-man who was passing suspected the cause, went
straight to the old love, and told her that a fine child was born; when
up she sprang, and pulled out a large nail from the beam of the roof,
calling out to her mother, "Muckle good your craft has done!" The wife
was forthwith delivered. (Napier, in The Folklore Record, II, 117.)

In the #Sicilian# tales, collected by Laura Gonzenbach, Nos 12 and 15,
we have the spell of folded hands placed between the knees to prevent
birth, and in No 54 hands raised to the head.[106] In all these examples
the spell is finally broken by telling the witch a piece of false news,
which causes her to forget herself and take away her hands.
(Sicilianische M[:a]rchen aus dem Volksmund gesammelt, Leipzig, 1870.)

We find in a #Roumanian# tale, contributed to Das Ausland for 1857, p.
1029, by F. Obert, and epitomized by Grundtvig, III, 859, No 84 d, a
wife condemned by her offended husband to go with child till he lays his
hand upon her. It is twenty years before she obtains grace, and the son
whom she then bears immediately slays his father. A #Wallachian# form of
this story (Walachische M[:a]rchen von Arthur u. Albert Schott, No 23)
omits the revenge by the new-born child, and ends happily.

With respect to the knots in st. 34, it is to be observed that the tying
of knots (as also the fastening of locks), either during the marriage
ceremony or at the approach of parturition was, and is still, believed
to be effectual for preventing conception or childbirth. The minister of
Logierait, Perthshire, testifies, about the year 1793, that immediately
before the celebration of a marriage it is the custom to loosen
carefully every knot about bride and bridegroom,--garters, shoe-strings,
etc. The knots are tied again before they leave the church. (Statistical
Account of Scotland, V, 83.) So among the Laps and Norwegians, when a
child is to be born, all the knots in the woman's clothes, or even all
the knots in the house, must be untied, because of their impeding
delivery. (Liebrecht, Zur Volkskunde, p. 322, who also cites the
Statistical Account of Scotland.)

[102] The Jamieson-Brown copy contains seventy-eight verses; Scott's
and the Tytler copy, eighty-eight. Dr Anderson's, Nichols's
Illustrations, VII, 176, counts seventy-six instead of eighty-eight;
but, judging by the description which Anderson has given of the
Alexander-Fraser-Tytler-Brown MS., at p. 179, he is not exact.
Still, so large a discrepancy is hard to explain.

'Earl Brand,' first given to the world by Mr Robert Bell in 1857, has
preserved most of the incidents of a very ancient story with a
faithfulness unequalled by any ballad that has been recovered from
English oral tradition. Before the publication of 'Earl Brand,' #A c#,
our known inheritance in this particular was limited to the beautiful
but very imperfect fragment called by Scott 'The Douglas Tragedy,' #B#;
half a dozen stanzas of another version of the same in Motherwell's
Minstrelsy, #E#; so much of Percy's 'Child of Elle' as was genuine,
which, upon the printing of his manuscript, turned out to be one fifth,
#F#; and two versions of Erlinton, #A#, #C#.[107] What now can be added
is but little: two transcripts of 'Earl Brand,' one of which, #A a#, has
suffered less from literary revision than the only copy hitherto
printed, #A c#; a third version of 'The Douglas Tragedy,' from
Motherwell's manuscript, #C#; a fourth from Kinloch's manuscripts, #D#;
and another of 'Erlinton,' #B#. Even 'Earl Brand' has lost a
circumstance that forms the turning-point in Scandinavian ballads, and
this capital defect attends all our other versions, though traces which
remain in 'Erlinton' make it nearly certain that our ballads originally
agreed in all important particulars with those which are to this day
recited in the north of Europe.

The corresponding #Scandinavian# ballad is 'Ribold and Guldborg,' and it
is a jewel that any clime might envy. Up to the time of Grundtvig's
edition, in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, No 82, though four versions had
been printed, the only current copy for a hundred and fifty years had
been Syv's No 88, based on a broadside of the date 1648, but compounded
from several sources; and it was in this form that the ballad became
known to the English through Jamieson's translation. Grundtvig has now
published twenty-seven versions of 'Ribold og Guldborg' (II, 347 ff,
nineteen; 675 ff, four; III, 849 ff, four:[108] of all which only two
are fragments), and nine of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' No 83, which, is the
same story set in a dramatic frame-work (II, 393 ff, seven; 680 f, one;
III, 857, one, a fragment). Three more Danish versions of 'Ribold og
Guldborg' are furnished by Kristensen, Gamle jydske Folkeviser, I, No
37, II, No 84 #A#, #B# (#C*#, #D*#, #E*#). To these we may add the last
half, sts 15-30, of 'Den farlige Jomfru,' Grundtvig, 184 #G#. Of
Grundtvig's texts, 82 #A# is of the sixteenth century; #B-H# are of the
seventeenth; the remainder and Kristensen's three from recent tradition.
Six versions of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' #A-F#, are of the seventeenth
century; one is of the eighteenth, #G#; and the remaining two are from
oral tradition of our day.

The first six of Grundtvig's versions of 'Ribold and Guldborg,' #A-F#,
are all from manuscripts, and all of a pure traditional character,
untampered with by "collators." #G# and #H# are mixed texts: they have
#F# for their basis, but have admitted stanzas from other sources. Most
of the versions from recitation are wonderful examples and proofs of the
fidelity with which simple people "report and hold" old tales: for, as
the editor has shown, verses which never had been printed, but which are
found in old manuscripts, are now met with in recited copies; and these
recited copies, again, have verses that occur in no Danish print or
manuscript, but which nevertheless are found in Norwegian and Swedish
recitations, and, what is more striking, in Icelandic tradition of two
hundred years' standing.

The story in the older Danish ballads runs thus. Ribold, a king's son,
sought Guldborg's love in secret. He said he would carry her to a land
where death and sorrow came not; where all the birds were cuckoos, and
all the grass was leeks, and all the streams ran wine. Guldborg, not
indisposed, asked how she should evade the watch kept over her by all
her family and by her betrothed. Ribold disguised her in his cloak and
armor, #B#, #E#, #F#, and rode off, with Guldborg behind him. On the
heath they meet a rich earl [a crafty man, #C#; her betrothed, #D#], who
asks, Whither away, with your stolen maid? [little page, #B#, #F#.]
Ribold replies that it is his youngest sister, whom he has taken from a
cloister, #A#, #E# [sick sister, #C#; brother, #B#, #F#; page, #D#].
This shift avails nothing; no more does a bribe which he offers for
keeping his secret. Report is at once made to her father that Guldborg
has eloped with Ribold. Guldborg perceives that they are pursued, and is
alarmed. Ribold reassures her, and prepares to meet his foes. He bids
Guldborg hold his horse, #B#, #C#, #E#, and, whatever may happen, not to
call him by name: "Though thou see me bleed, name me not to death;
though thou see me fall, name me not at all!" Ribold cuts down six or
seven of her brothers and her father, besides others of her kin; the
youngest brother only is left, and Guldborg in an agony calls upon
Ribold to spare him, to carry tidings to her mother. No sooner was his
name pronounced than Ribold received a mortal wound. He sheathed his
sword, and said, Come, wilt thou ride with me? Wilt thou go home to thy
mother again, or wilt thou follow so sad a swain? And she answered, I
will not go home to my mother again; I will follow thee, my heart's
dearest man. They rode through the wood, and not a word came from the
mouth of either. Guldborg asked, Why art thou not as glad as before? And
Ribold answered, Thy brother's sword has been in my heart. They reached
his house. He called to one to take his horse, to another to bring a
priest, and said his brother should have Guldborg. But she would not
give her faith to two brothers. Ribold died that night, #C#. Three dead
came from Ribold's bower: Ribold and his lief, and his mother, who died
of grief! In #A# Guldborg slays herself, and dies in her lover's arms.

'Hildebrand and Hilde,' #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#, opens with the heroine in a
queen's service, sewing her seam wildly, putting silk for gold and gold
for silk. The queen calls her to account. Hilde begs her mistress to
listen to her tale of sorrow. She was a king's daughter. Twelve knights
had been appointed to be her guard, and one had beguiled her,
Hildebrand, son of the king of England. They went off together, and
were surprised by her brothers [father, #B#, #C#, #D#]. Hildebrand bade
her be of good cheer; but she must not call him by name if she saw him
bleed or fall, #A#, #B#, #D#. A heap of knights soon lay at his feet.
Hilde forgot herself, and called out, Hildebrand, spare my youngest
brother! Hildebrand that instant received a mortal wound, and fell. The
younger brother tied her to his horse, and dragged her home. They shut
her up at first in a strong tower, built for the purpose, #A#,# B#
[Swedish #A#, a dark house], and afterwards sold her into servitude for
a church bell. Her mother's heart broke at the bell's first stroke, and
Hilde, with the last word of her tale, fell dead in the queen's arms.

The most important deviation of the later versions from the old is
exhibited by #S# and #T#, and would probably be observed in #Q#, #R#, as
well, were these complete. #S#, #T# are either a mixture of 'Ribold and
Guldborg' with 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' or forms transitional between the
two. In these Ribold does not live to reach his home, and Guldborg,
unable to return to hers, offers herself to a queen, to spin silk and
weave gold [braid hair and work gold]. But she cannot sew for grief. The
queen smacks her on the cheek for neglecting her needle. Poor Guldborg
utters a protest, but gives no explanation, and the next morning is
found dead. Singularly enough, the name of the hero in #Q#, #R#, #S#,
#T#, is also an intermediate form. Ribold is the name in all the old
Danish copies except #C#, and that has Ride-bolt. Danish #I#, #K#, #X#,
#Z#, all the Icelandic copies, and Swedish #D#, have either Ribold or
some unimportant variation. #Q#, #R#, #S#, have Ride-brand [#T#,
Rederbrand]. All copies of Grundtvig 83, except Danish #G#, Swedish #C#,
which do not give the hero's name, have Hilde-brand; so also 82 #N#,
#O#, #P#, #V#, and Kristensen, I, No 37. The name of the woman is nearly
constant both in 82 and 83.

The paradise promised Guldborg in all the old versions of 82[109]
disappears from the recited copies, except #K#, #M#. It certainly did
not originally belong to 'Ribold and Guldborg,' or to another Danish
ballad in which it occurs ('Den trofaste Jomfru,' Grundtvig, 249 #A#),
but rather to ballads like 'Kvindemorderen,' Grundtvig, 183 #A#, or
'L['i]ti Kersti,' Landstad, 44, where a supernatural being, a demon or a
hillman, seeks to entice away a mortal maid. See No 4, p. 27. In 82 #L#,
#N#, #U#, #V#, #Y#, #[AE]#, #[/O]#, and Kristensen's copies, the lovers are
not encountered by anybody who reports their flight. Most of the later
versions, #K#, #L#, #M#, #N#, #P#, #U#, #V#, #Y#, #[AE]#, #[/O]#, and
Kristensen's three, make them halt in a wood, where Ribold goes to sleep
in Guldborg's lap, and is roused by her when she perceives that they are
pursued. So Norwegian #B#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #C#, and 'Hildebrand and
Hilde' #B#. #M#, #Q#, #R#, #S#, #T#, #Z#, have not a specific
prohibition of _dead-naming_, but even these enjoin silence. 83 #C# is
the only ballad in which there is a fight and no prohibition of either
kind, but it is clear from the course of the story that the stanza
containing the usual injunction has simply dropped out. #P# is
distinguished from all other forms of the story by the heroine's killing
herself before her dying lover reaches his house.

The four first copies of 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' as has been seen, have
the story of Ribold and Guldborg with some slight differences and some
abridgment. There is no elopement in #B#: the lovers are surprised in
the princess' bower. When Hilde has finished her tale, in #A#, the queen
declares that Hildebrand was her son. In #B# she interrupts the
narrative by announcing her discovery that Hildebrand was her brother.
#C# and #D# have nothing of the sort. There is no fight in #E-H#. #E#
has taken up the commonplace of the bower on the strand which was forced
by nine men.[110] Hildebrand is again the son of the queen, and, coming
in just as Hilde has expired, exclaims that he will have no other love,
sets his sword against a stone, and runs upon it. #H# has the same
catastrophe. #F# represents the father as simply showing great
indignation and cruelty on finding out that one of the guardian knights
had beguiled his daughter, and presently selling her for a new church
bell. The knight turns out here again to be the queen's son; the queen
says he shall betroth Hille, and Hille faints for joy. #G# agrees with
#B# as to the surprise in the bower. The knight's head is hewn off on
the spot. The queen gives Hilde her youngest son for a husband, and
Hilde avows that she is consoled. #I# agrees with #E# so far as it goes,
but is a short fragment.

There are three #Icelandic# versions of this ballad, 'Ribbalds
kv[ae][dh]i,' ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, No 16, all of the seventeenth
century. They all come reasonably close to the Danish as to the story,
and particularly #A#. Ribbald, with no prologue, invites Gullbr['u]n
"to ride." He sets her on a white horse; of all women she rode best.
They have gone but a little way, when they see a pilgrim riding towards
them, who hails Ribbald with, Welcome, with thy stolen maid! Ribbald
pretends that the maid is his sister, but the pilgrim knows very well
it is Gullbr['u]n. She offers her cloak to him not to tell her father,
but the pilgrim goes straight to the king, and says, Thy daughter is
off! The king orders his harp to be brought, for no purpose but to
dash it on the floor once and twice, and break out the strings. He
then orders his horse. Gullbr['u]n sees her father come riding under a
hill-side, then her eleven brothers, then seven brothers-in-law. She
begs Ribbald to spare her youngest brother's life, that he may carry
the news to her mother. He replies, I will tie my horse by the reins;
you take up your sewing! then three times forbids her to name him
during the fight. He slew her father first, next the eleven brothers,
then the other seven, all which filled her with compunction, and she
cried out, Ribbald, still thy brand! On the instant Ribbald received
many wounds. He wiped his bloody sword, saying, This is what you
deserve, Gullbr['u]n, but love is your shield; then set her on her
horse, and rode to his brother's door. He called out, Here is a wife
for you! But Gullbr['u]n said, Never will I be given to two brothers.
Soon after Ribbald gave up the ghost. There was more mourning than
mirth; three bodies went to the grave in one coffin, Ribbald, his lady,
and his mother, who died of grief.

#B# and #C# have lost something at the beginning, #C# starting at the
same point as our 'Douglas Tragedy.' The king pursues Ribbald by water.
Gullbr['u]n (#B#) stands in a tower and sees him land. Ribbald gives
Gullbr['u]n to his brother, as in #A#: she lives in sorrow, and dies a
maid.

#Norwegian.# ('Ribold and Guldborg.') #A#, 'Rikeball og stolt
Gu[dh]bj[:o]rg,' Landstad, 33; #B#, 'Veneros og stolt [:O]lleber,'
Landstad, 34; #C#, #D#, #E#, #F#, in part described and cited, with
six other copies, Grundtvig, III, p. 853 f. The last half of Landstad
No 23, stanzas 17-34, and stanzas 18-25 of Landstad 28 #B#, also
belong here. #A# agrees with the older Danish versions, even to the
extent of the paradise. #B# has been greatly injured. Upon the lady's
warning Veneros of the approach of her father, he puts her up in an
oak-tree for safety. He warns her not to call him by name, and she says
she will rather die first; but her firmness is not put to the test
in this ballad, some verses having dropped out just at this point.
Veneros is advised to surrender, but dispatches his assailants by
eighteen thousands (like Lille br['o]r, in Landstad, 23), and by way of
conclusion hews the false P['a]l greive, who had reported his elopement
to [:O]lleber's father, into as many pieces. He then takes [:O]lleber
on his horse, they ride away and are married. Such peculiarities in the
other copies as are important to us will be noticed further on.

('Hildebrand and Hilde.') #A#, one of two Norwegian copies communicated
by Professor Bugge to Grundtvig, III, 857 f, agrees well with Danish
#E#, but has the happy conclusion of Danish #F#, #G#, #I#. The heroine
is sold for _nine_ bells. #B#, the other, omits the bower-breaking of
#A# and Danish #E#, and ends with marriage.

The #Swedish# forms of 'Ribold and Guldborg' are: #A#, 'Hillebrand,'
Afzelius, No 2; #B#, 'Herr Redebold,' and #C#, 'Kung Vallemo,'
Afzelius, No 80; new ed., No 2, 1, 2, 3; #D#, 'Ribbolt,' Arwidsson, No
78; #E#, 'Herr Redebold' #F#, 'Herting Liljebrand,' and #G#, 'Herr
Balder,' in Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection; #H#, 'Kung
Walmon,' E. Wigstr[:o]m's Folkdiktning, No 15, p. 33. #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#,
are not markedly different from the ordinary Danish ballad, and this is
true also, says Grundtvig, of the unprinted versions, #E#, #F#, #G#. #D#
and #G# are of the seventeenth century, the others from recent
tradition. Ribold is pictured in #D# as a bold prince, equally versed in
runes and arts as in manly exercises. He visits Gi[:o]tha by night: they
slumber sweet, but wake in blood. She binds up his wounds with rich
kerchiefs. He rides home to his father's, and sits down on a bench. The
king bids his servants see what is the matter, and adds, Be he sick or
be he hurt, he got it at Gi[:o]tha-Lilla's. They report the prince stabbed
with sharp pikes within, and bound with silk kerchiefs without. Ribold
bids them bury him in the mould, and not blame Gi[:o]tha-Lilla; "for my
horse was fleet, and I was late, and he hurtled me 'gainst an
apple-tree" (so Hillebrand in #A#). #E# represents the heroine as
surviving her lover, and united to a young king, but always grieving for
Redebold.

'Hildebrand and Hilde' exists in Swedish in three versions: #A#, a
broadside of the last part of the seventeenth century, now printed in
the new edition of Afzelius, p. 142 ff of the notes (the last nine
stanzas before, in Danske Viser, III, 438 f); #B#, Afzelius, No 32, new
ed. No 26, #C#, Arwidsson, No 107, both taken down in this century. In
#A# and #B# Hillebrand, son of the king of England, carries off Hilla;
they halt in a grove; she wakes him from his sleep when she hears her
father and seven brothers coming; he enjoins her not to call him by
name, which still she does upon her father's being slain [or when only
her youngest brother is left], and Hillebrand thereupon receives mortal
wounds. He wipes his sword, saying, This is what you would deserve, were
you not Hilla. The youngest brother ties Hilla to his horse, drags her
home, and confines her in a dark house, which swarms with snakes and
dragons (#A# only). They sell her for a new church bell, and her
mother's heart breaks at the first sound. Hilla falls dead at the
queen's knee. #C# has lost the dead-naming, and ends with the queen's
promising to be Hilla's best friend.

A detailed comparison of the English ballads, and especially of 'Earl
Brand,' with the Scandinavian (such as Grundtvig has made, III, 855 f)
shows an unusual and very interesting agreement. The name Earl Brand, to
begin with, is in all probability a modification of the Hildebrand found
in Danish 82 #N#, #O#, #P#, #V#, #C*#, in all versions of Danish 83, and
in the corresponding Swedish #A#. Ell, too, in Percy's fragment, which
may have been Ell[:e] earlier, points to Hilde, or something like it, and
Erl-inton might easily be corrupted from such a form as the Alibrand of
Norwegian #B# (Grundtvig, III, 858). Hildebrand is the son of the king
of England in Danish 83 #A-E#, and the lady in 'Earl Brand' is the same
king's daughter, an interchange such as is constantly occurring in
tradition. Stanza 2 can hardly be the rightful property of 'Earl Brand.'
Something very similar is met with in 'Leesome Brand,' and is not much
in place there. For 'old Carl Hood,' of whom more presently, Danish 82
#X# and Norwegian #A#, #C# have an old man, Danish #C# a crafty man, #T#
a false younker, and Norwegian #B# and three others "false P['a]l greive."
The lady's urging Earl Brand to slay the old carl, and the answer, that
it would be sair to kill a gray-haired man, sts 8, 9, are almost
literally repeated in Norwegian #A#, Landstad, No 33. The knight does
slay the old man in Danish #X# and Norwegian #C#, and slays the court
page in Danish #Z#, and false P['a]l greive in Norwegian #B#,--in this last
_after_ the battle. The question, "Where have ye stolen this lady away?"
in st. 11, occurs in Danish 82 #A#, #D#, #E#, #K#, #P#, #R#, #S#, #T#,
#Z#, in Norwegian #B# and Icelandic #B#, and something very similar in
many other copies. The reply, "She is my sick sister, whom I have
brought from Winchester" [nunnery], is found almost literally in Danish
#C#, #X#, #Z#: "It is my sick sister; I took her yesterday from the
cloister." [Danish #E#, it is my youngest sister from the cloister; she
is sick: Danish #A#, youngest sister from cloister: Danish #R# and
Norwegian #B#, sister from cloister: Danish #S#, #T#, sister's daughter
from cloister: Norwegian #F#, sister from Holstein: Danish #P#,
Icelandic #A#, Norwegian #A#, sister.] The old man, crafty man, rich
earl, in the Scandinavian ballads, commonly answers that he knows
Guldborg very well; but in Danish #D#, where Ribold says it is a court
page he has hired, we have something like sts 14, 15: "Why has he such
silk-braided hair?" On finding themselves discovered, the lovers, in the
Scandinavian ballad, attempt to purchase silence with a bribe: Danish
#A-I#, #M#, Icelandic and Norwegian #A#, #B#. This is not expressly done
in 'Earl Brand,' but the same seems to be meant in st. 10 by "I'll gie
him a pound." St. 17 is fairly paralleled by Danish #S#, 18, 19: "Where
is Guldborg, thy daughter? Walking in the garden, gathering roses;" and
st. 18, by Norwegian #B#, 15: "You may search without and search within,
and see whether [:O]lleber you can find." The announcement in st. 19 is
made in almost all the Scandinavian ballads, in words equivalent to
"Ribold is off with thy daughter," and then follows the arming for the
pursuit. The lady looks over her shoulder and sees her father coming, as
in st. 21, in Danish 82 #A#, #F#, #H#, #I#, #Q#, #R#, #T#, #X#, #Z#, and
Norwegian #A#.

The scene of the fight is better preserved in the Scottish ballads than
in 'Earl Brand,' though none of these have the cardinal incident of the
death-naming. All the Scottish versions, #B-F#, and also 'Erlinton,'
#A#, #B#, make the lady hold the knight's horse: so Danish 82 #B#, #C#,
#E#, #I#, #[AE]#, #D*#, Icelandic #C#, Norwegian and Swedish #A#, and
Danish 83 #D#. Of the knight's injunction, "Name me not to death, though
thou see me bleed," which, as has been noted, is kept by nearly every
Danish ballad (and by the Icelandic, the Norwegian, and by Swedish
'Ribold and Guldborg,' #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#, Swedish 'Hildebrand and
Hilde,' #A#, #B#), there is left in English only this faint trace, in
'Erlinton,' #A#, #B#: "See ye dinna change your cheer until ye see my
body bleed." It is the wish to save the life of her youngest brother
that causes the lady to call her lover by name in the larger number of
Scandinavian ballads, and she adds, "that he may carry the tidings to my
mother," in Danish 82 #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, #F#, #G#, #H#, #M#, #X#, 83
#B#, #C#, #D#. Grief for her father's death is the impulse in Danish 82
#I#, #N#, #O#, #Q#, #R#, #S#, #Y#, #Z#, #[AE]#, #[/O]#, #A*#, #C*#, #D*#,
#E*#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#. English #A# says nothing of father or
brother; but in #B#, #C#, #D#, #E#, it is the father's death that causes
the exclamation. All the assailants are slain in 'Erlinton' #A#, #B#,
except an aged knight [the auldest man], and he is spared to carry the
tidings home. 'Erlinton' #C#, however, agrees with the oldest Danish
copies in making the youngest brother the motive of the lady's
intervention. It is the fifteenth, and last, of the assailants that
gives Earl Brand his death-wound; in Danish #H#, the youngest brother,
whom he has been entreated to spare; and so, apparently, in Danish #C#
and Norwegian #A#.

The question, "Will you go with me or return to your mother?" which we
find in English #B#, #C#, #D#, is met with also in many Danish versions,
82 #B#, #H#, #K#, #L#, #M#, #N#, #P#, #U#, #Z#, #[AE]#, #[/O]#, #C*#, and
Swedish #A#, #B#, #C#. The dying man asks to have his bed made in
English #B#, #C#, as in Danish 82 #B#, #C#, #K#, #L#, #N#, #U#, #N#,
#[AE]#, #[/O]#, #C*#, #D*#, Norwegian #A#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#, and
desires that the lady may marry his brother in English #A#, as in nearly
all the Danish versions, Icelandic #A#, #B#, #C#, Norwegian #C#, #D#,
#E#, Swedish #C#. He declares her a maiden true in 'Earl Brand,' #A c#
33, and affirms the same with more particularity in Danish 82 #B#, #C#,
#E#, #F#, #G#, #M#, #[/O]#, Icelandic #B#, #C#, Norwegian #A#, #C#, #E#,
Swedish #C#. The growth of the rose and brier [bush and brier] from the
lovers' grave in English #B#, #C#, is not met with in any version of
'Ribold and Guldborg' proper, but 'Den farlige Jomfru' #G#, Grundtvig,
184, the last half of which, as already remarked, is a fragment of a
Ribold ballad, has a linden in place of the rose and brier.

No complete ballad of the Ribold class is known to have survived in
#German#, but a few verses have been interpolated by tradition in the
earliest copy of the Ulinger ballad (vv. 47-56), which may almost with
certainty be assigned to one of the other description. They disturb the
narrative where they are, and a ready occasion for their slipping in was
afforded by the scene being exactly the same in both ballads: a knight
and a lady, with whom he had eloped, resting in a wood.[111] See No 4,
p. 32 of this volume.

We find in a pretty #Neapolitan-Albanian# ballad, which, with others, is
regarded by the editors as a fragment of a connected poem, several of
the features of these northern ones. A youth asks a damsel in marriage,
but is not favored by her mother, father, or brother. He wins over first
the mother and then the father by handsome presents, but his gifts,
though accepted, do not conciliate the brother. He carries off the lady
on horseback, and is attacked by the brother, four uncles, and seven
cousins. He is killed and falls from his horse; with him the lady falls
dead also, and both are covered up with stones. In the spring the youth
comes up a cypress, the damsel comes up a vine, and encloses the cypress
in her arms. (Rapsodie d'un poema albanese raccolte nelle colonie del
Napoletano, de Rada and de' Coronei, Florence, 1866, lib. ii., canto
viii.)

These ballads would seem to belong among the numerous ramifications of
the Hilde saga. Of these, the second lay of Helgi Hundingslayer, in
S[ae]mund's Edda, and 'Waltharius,' the beautiful poem of Ekkehard, are
most like the ballads.[112] Leaving 'Waltharius' till we come to
'Erlinton,' we may notice that Sigr['u]n, in the Helgi lay, though promised
by her father to another man, H[:o]dbrodd, son of Granmar, preferred Helgi.
She sought him out, and told him frankly her predicament: she feared,
she said, the wrath of her friends, for breaking her father's promise.
Helgi accepted her affection, and bade her not care for the displeasure
of her relatives. A great battle ensued between Helgi and the sons of
Granmar, who were aided by Sigr['u]n's father and brothers. All her kinsmen
were slain except one brother, Dag. He bound himself to peace with
Helgi, but, notwithstanding, made sacrifices to Odin to obtain the loan
of his spear, and with it slew Helgi. We have, therefore, in so much of
the lay of Helgi Hundingslayer, the groundwork of the story of the
ballads: a woman, who, as in many of the Ribold ballads, has been
betrothed to a man she does not care for, gives herself to another;
there is a fight, in which a great number of her kinsmen fall; one
brother survives, who is the death of the man she loves. The lay of
Helgi Hi[:o]rvard's son, whose story has much in common with that of his
namesake, affords two resemblances of detail not found in the lay of the
Hundingslayer. Helgi Hi[:o]rvard's son, while his life-blood is ebbing,
expresses himself in almost the words of the dying Ribold: "The sword
has come very near my heart." He then, like Ribold and Earl Brand,
declares his wish that his wife should marry his brother, and she, like
Guldborg, declines a second union.[113]

There is also a passage in the earlier history of Helgi Hundingslayer
of which traces appear to be preserved in ballads, and before all in
the English ballad 'Earl Brand,' #A#. Hunding and Helgi's family were
at feud. Helgi introduced himself into Hunding's court as a spy, and
when he was retiring sent word to Hunding's son that he had been there
disguised as a son of Hagal, Helgi's foster-father. Hunding sent men
to take him, and Helgi, to escape them, was forced to assume woman's
clothes and grind at the mill. While Hunding's men are making search,
a mysterious blind man, surnamed the bale-wise, or evil-witted (Blindr
inn b[:o]lv['i]si), calls out, Sharp are the eyes of Hagal's maid; it
is no churl's blood that stands at the mill; the stones are riving,
the meal-trough is springing; a hard lot has befallen a war-king when
a chieftain must grind strange barley; fitter for that hand is the
sword-hilt than the mill-handle. Hagal pretends that the fierce-eyed
maid is a virago whom Helgi had taken captive, and in the end Helgi
escapes. This malicious personage reappears in the Hr[^o]mund saga
as "Blind the Bad" and "the Carl Blind, surnamed Bav['i]s," and is
found elsewhere. His likeness to "old Carl Hood," who "comes for ill,
but never for good," and who gives information of Earl Brand's flight
with the king's daughter, does not require to be insisted on. Both
are identical, we can scarcely doubt, with the blind [one-eyed] old
man of many tales, who goes about in various disguises, sometimes as
beggar, with his hood or hat slouched over his face,--that is Odin, the
S['i][dh]h[:o]ttr or Deep-hood of S[ae]mund, who in the saga of H['a]lf
and his champions is called simple Hood, as here, and expressly said to
be Odin.[114] Odin, though not a thoroughly malignant divinity, had his
dark side, and one of his titles in S[ae]mund's Edda is B[:o]lverkr,
_maleficus_. He first caused war by casting his spear among men, and
Dag, after he has killed Helgi, says Odin was the author of all the
mischief, for he brought strife among kinsmen.[115]

The disastrous effects of "naming" in a great emergency appear in other
northern traditions, though not so frequently as one would expect. A
diverting Swedish saga, which has been much quoted, relates how St. Olof
bargained with a troll for the building of a huge church, the pay to be
the sun and moon, or St. Olof himself. The holy man was equally amazed
and embarrassed at seeing the building run up by the troll with great
rapidity, but during a ramble among the hills had the good luck to
discover that the troll's name was Wind and Weather, after which all was
easy. For while the troll was on the roof of the church, Olof called out
to him,

    'Wind and Weather, hi!
    You've set the spire awry;'

and the troll, thus called by his name, lost his strength, fell off, and
was dashed into a hundred pieces, all flint stones. (Iduna, Part 3, p.
60 f, note. Other forms of the same story in Afzelius, Sago-H[:a]fder, III,
100 f; Faye, Norske Folke-Sagn, p. 14, 2d ed.; Hofberg, Nerikes Gamla
Minnen, p. 234.)

It is a Norwegian belief that when a nix assumes the human shape in
order to carry some one off, it will be his death if the selected victim
recognizes him and names him, and in this way a woman escaped in a
ballad. She called out, So you are the Nix, that pestilent beast, and
the nix "disappeared in red blood." (Faye, as above, p. 49, note.) A
nix is baffled in the same way in a F[ae]roe and an Icelandic ballad cited
by Grundtvig, II, 57.

The marvellous horse Blak agrees to carry Waldemar [Hildebrand] over a
great piece of water for the rescue of his daughter [sister],
stipulating, however, that his name shall not be uttered. The rider
forgets himself in a panic, calls to the horse by his name, and is
thrown off into the water. The horse, whose powers had been
supernatural, and who had been _running_ over the water as if it were
land, has now only ordinary strength, and is forced to swim. He brings
the lady back on the same terms, which she keeps, but when he reaches
the land he is bleeding at every hair, and falls dead. (Landstad, 58;
Grundtvig, 62; Afzelius, 59, preface; Kristensen, I, No 66.)

Klaufi, a berserker, while under the operation of his peculiar fury,
loses his strength, and can no longer wield the weapon he was fighting
with, upon Gr['i]ss's crying out, "Klaufi, Klaufi, be not so mad!"
(Svarfd[ae]la Saga, p. 147, and again p. 156 f.) So the blood-thirst of the
avenger's sword in the magnificent Danish ballad 'H[ae]vnersv[ae]rdet' is
restrained by naming. (Grundtvig, No 25, st. 35.) Again, men engaged in
_hamfarir_, that is in roving about in the shape of beasts, their proper
bodies remaining lifeless the while, must not be called by name, for
this might compel them to return at once to their own shape, or possibly
prevent their ever doing so. (Kristni Saga, ed. 1773, p. 149. R.T. King,
in Notes and Queries, 2d Ser., II, 506.) Grundtvig remarks that this
belief is akin to what is related in F['a]fnism['a]l (prose interpolation
after st. 1), that Sigurd concealed his name by reason of a belief in
old times that a dying man's word had great power, if he cursed his foe
by name. (D.g.F., II, 340.)

The beautiful fancy of plants springing from the graves of star-crossed
lovers, and signifying by the intertwining of stems or leaves, or in
other analogous ways, that an earthly passion has not been extinguished
by death, presents itself, as is well known, very frequently in popular
poetry. Though the graves be made far apart, even on opposite sides of
the church, or one to the north and one to the south outside of the
church, or one without kirk wall and one in the choir, however
separated, the vines or trees seek one another out, and mingle their
branches or their foliage:

    "Even from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
    Even in our ashes live their wonted fires!"

The principal ballads which exhibit this conception in one or another
form are the following:

In English, 'The Douglas Tragedy,' 'Fair Margaret and Sweet William,'
'Lord Thomas and Fair Annet,' 'Fair Janet,' 'Prince Robert,' 'Lord
Lovel.' The plants in all these are either a brier and a rose, or a
brier and a birk.

The idea of the love-animated plants has been thought to be derived from
the romance of Tristan, where it also occurs; agreeably to a general
principle, somewhat hastily assumed, that when romances and popular
ballads have anything in common, priority belongs to the romances. The
question as to precedence in this instance is an open one, for the
fundamental conception is not less a favorite with ancient Greek than
with medi[ae]val imagination.

Tristan and Isolde had unwittingly drunk of a magical potion which had
the power to induce an indestructible and ever-increasing love. Tristan
died of a wound received in one of his adventures, and Isolde of a
broken heart, because, though summoned to his aid, she arrived too late
for him to profit by her medical skill. They were buried in the same
church. According to the French prose romance, a green brier issued from
Tristan's tomb, mounted to the roof, and, descending to Isolde's tomb,
made its way within. King Marc caused the brier to be cut down three
several times, but the morning after it was as flourishing as
before.[116]

Eilhart von Oberge, vv. 9509-21 (ed. Lichtenstein, Quellen u.
Forschungen, xix, 429) and the German prose romance (B[:u]sching u.
von der Hagen, Buch der Liebe, c. 60), Ulrich von Th[:u]rheim, vv.
3546-50, and Heinrich von Freiberg, vv. 6819-41 (in von der Hagen's ed.
of G.v. Strassburg's Tristan) make King Marc _plant_, the first two a
grape-vine over Tristan and a rose over Isolde, the others, wrongly,
the rose over Tristan and the vine over Isolde. These plants, according
to Heinrich, struck their roots into the hearts of the lovers below,
while their branches embraced above. Icelandic ballads and an Icelandic
saga represent Tristan's wife as forbidding the lovers to be buried in
the same grave, and ordering them to be buried on opposite sides of the
church. Trees spring from their bodies and meet over the church roof,
(['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, 23 #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#; Saga af Tristram
ok ['I]s[:o]nd, Brynjulfson, p. 199; Tristrams Saga ok ['I]sondar,
K[:o]lbing, p. 112). The later Titurel imitates the conclusion of
Tristan. (Der j[:u]ngere Titurel, ed. Hahn, sts 5789, 5790.)

Among the miracles of the Virgin there are several which are closely
akin to the prodigies already noted. A lily is found growing from the
mouth of a clerk, who, though not leading an exemplary life, had every
day said his ave before the image of Mary: Unger, Mariu Saga, No 50;
Berceo, No 3; Miracles de N.D. de Chartres, p. lxiii, No 29, and p. 239;
Marien-legenden (Stuttgart, 1846), No xi and p. 269. A rose springs from
the grave and roots in the heart of a knight who had spared the honor
of a maid because her name was Mary: Unger, No clvi, Hagen's
Gesammtabenteuer, lxxiii. Roses inscribed Maria grow from the mouth,
eyes, and ears of a monk: Unger, cxxxvii; and a lily grows over a monk's
grave, springing from his mouth, every leaf of which bears Ave Maria in
golden letters: Unger, cxxxviii; Gesammtabenteuer, lxxxviii; Libro de
Exenplos, Romania, 1878, p. 509, 43, 44; etc., etc.

No one can fail to be reminded of the purple, lily-shaped flower,
inscribed with the mournful AI AI, that rose from the blood of
Hyacinthus, and of the other from the blood of Ajax, with the same
letters, "his name and eke his plaint," h[ae]c nominis, illa querell[ae].
(Ovid, Met. X, 210 ff; xiii, 394 ff.) The northern lindens have their
counterpart in the elms from the grave of Protesilaus, and in the trees
into which Philemon and Baucis were transformed. See, upon the whole
subject, the essay of Koberstein in the Weimar Jahrbuch, I, 73 ff, with
K[:o]hler's supplement, p. 479 ff; Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, II, 689 f,
and III, 246.

"The ballad of the 'Douglas Tragedy,'" says Scott, "is one of the few to
which popular tradition has ascribed complete locality. The farm of
Blackhouse, in Selkirkshire, is said to have been the scene of this
melancholy event. There are the remains of a very ancient tower,
adjacent to the farm-house, in a wild and solitary glen, upon a torrent
named Douglas burn, which joins the Yarrow after passing a craggy rock
called the Douglas craig.... From this ancient tower Lady Margaret is
said to have been carried by her lover. Seven large stones, erected upon
the neighboring heights of Blackhouse, are shown, as marking the spot
where the seven brethren were slain; and the Douglas burn is averred to
have been the stream at which the lovers stopped to drink: so minute is
tradition in ascertaining the scene of a tragical tale, which,
considering the rude state of former times, had probably foundation in
some real event."

The localities of the Danish story were ascertained, to her entire
satisfaction, by Anne Krabbe in 1605-6, and are given again in Resen's
Atlas Danicus, 1677. See Grundtvig, II, 342 f.

    And they met neither rich nor poor.

    7
    Until they met with old Carl Hood;
    He comes for ill, but never for good.

    8
    'Earl Bran, if ye love me,
    Seize this old carl, and gar him die.'

    9
    'O lady fair, it wad be sair,
    To slay an old man that has grey hair.

    10
    'O lady fair, I'll no do sae;
    I'll gie him a pound, and let him gae.'

    11
    'O where hae ye ridden this lee lang day?
    Or where hae ye stolen this lady away?'

    12
    'I have not ridden this lee lang day.
    Nor yet have I stolen this lady away.

    13
    'She is my only, my sick sister,
    Whom I have brought from Winchester.'

    14
    'If she be sick, and like to dead,
    Why wears she the ribbon sae red?

    15
    'If she be sick, and like to die,
    Then why wears she the gold on high?'

    16
    When he came to this lady's gate,
    Sae rudely as he rapped at it.

    17
    'O where's the lady o this ha?'
    'She's out with her maids to play at the ba.'

    18
    'Ha, ha, ha! ye are a' mistaen:
    Gae count your maidens oer again.

    19
    'I saw her far beyond the moor,
    Away to be the Earl o Bran's whore.'

    20
    The father armed fifteen of his best men,
    To bring his daughter back again.

    21
    Oer her left shoulder the lady looked then:
    'O Earl Bran, we both are tane.'

    22
    'If they come on me ane by ane,
    Ye may stand by and see them slain.

    23
    'But if they come on me one and all,
    Ye may stand by and see me fall.'

    24
    They have come on him ane by ane,
    And he has killed them all but ane.

    25
    And that ane came behind his back,
    And he's gien him a deadly whack.

    26
    But for a' sae wounded as Earl Bran was,
    He has set his lady on her horse.

    27
    They rode till they came to the water o Doune,
    And then he alighted to wash his wounds.

    28
    'O Earl Bran, I see your heart's blood!'
    'T is but the gleat o my scarlet hood.'

    29
    They rode till they came to his mother's gate,
    And sae rudely as he rapped at it.

    30
    'O my son's slain, my son's put down,
    And a' for the sake of an English loun.'

    31
    'O say not sae, my dear mother,
    But marry her to my youngest brother.

    'Rise up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas,' she says,
      'And put on your armour so bright;
    Let it never be said that a daughter of thine
      Was married to a lord under night.

    2
    'Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,
      And put on your armour so bright,
    And take better care of your youngest sister,
      For your eldest's awa the last night.'

    3
    He's mounted her on a milk-white steed,
      And himself on a dapple grey,
    With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,
      And lightly they rode away.

    4
    Lord William lookit oer his left shoulder,
      To see what he could see,
    And there he spy'd her seven brethren bold,
      Come riding over the lee.

    5
    'Light down, light down, Lady Margret,' he said,
      'And hold my steed in your hand,
    Until that against your seven brethren bold,
      And your father, I mak a stand.'

    6
    She held his steed in her milk-white hand,
      And never shed one tear,
    Until that she saw her seven brethren fa,
      And her father hard fighting, who lovd her so dear.

    7
    'O hold your hand, Lord William!' she said,
      'For your strokes they are wondrous sair;
    True lovers I can get many a ane,
      But a father I can never get mair.'

    8
    O she's taen out her handkerchief,
      It was o the holland sae fine,
    And aye she dighted her father's bloody wounds,
      That were redder than the wine.

    9
    'O chuse, O chuse, Lady Margret,' he said,
      'O whether will ye gang or bide?'
    'I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William,' she said,
      'For ye have left me no other guide.'

    10
    He's lifted her on a milk-white steed,
      And himself on a dapple grey,
    With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,
      And slowly they baith rade away.

    11
    O they rade on, and on they rade,
      And a' by the light of the moon,
    Until they came to yon wan water,
      And there they lighted down.

    12
    They lighted down to tak a drink
      Of the spring that ran sae clear,
    And down the stream ran his gude heart's blood,
      And sair she gan to fear.

    13
    'Hold up, hold up, Lord William,' she says,
      'For I fear that you are slain;'
    ''T is naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak,
      That shines in the water sae plain.'

    14
    O they rade on, and on they rade,
      And a' by the light of the moon,
    Until they cam to his mother's ha door,
      And there they lighted down.

    15
    'Get up, get up, lady mother,' he says,
      'Get up, and let me in!
    Get up, get up, lady mother,' he says,
      'For this night my fair lady I've win.

    16
    'O mak my bed, lady mother,' he says,
      'O mak it braid and deep,
    And lay Lady Margret close at my back,
      And the sounder I will sleep.'

    17
    Lord William was dead lang ere midnight,
      Lady Margret lang ere day,
    And all true lovers that go thegither,
      May they have mair luck than they!

    18
    Lord William was buried in St. Mary's kirk,
      Lady Margret in Mary's quire;
    Out o the lady's grave grew a bonny red rose,
      And out o the knight's a briar.

    19
    And they twa met, and they twa plat,
      And fain they wad be near;
    And a' the warld might ken right weel
      They were twa lovers dear.

    20
    But bye and rade the Black Douglas,
      And wow but he was rough!
    For he pulld up the bonny brier,
      And flang't in St. Mary's Loch.

    'Rise up, rise up, my seven brave sons,
      And dress in your armour so bright;
    Earl Douglas will hae Lady Margaret awa
      Before that it be light.

    2
    'Arise, arise, my seven brave sons,
      And dress in your armour so bright;
    It shall never be said that a daughter of mine
      Shall go with an earl or a knight.'

    3
    'O will ye stand, fair Margaret,' he says,
      'And hold my milk-white steed,
    Till I fight your father and seven brethren,
      In yonder pleasant mead?'

    4
    She stood and held his milk-white steed,
      She stood trembling with fear,
    Until she saw her seven brethren fall,
      And her father that loved her dear.

    5
    'Hold your hand, Earl Douglas,' she says,
      'Your strokes are wonderous sair;
    I may get sweethearts again enew,
      But a father I'll ne'er get mair.'

    6
    She took out a handkerchief
      Was made o' the cambrick fine,
    And aye she wiped her father's bloody wounds,
      And the blood sprung up like wine.

    7
    'Will ye go, fair Margaret?' he said,
      'Will ye now go, or bide?'
    'Yes, I'll go, sweet William,' she said,
      'For ye've left me never a guide.

    8
    'If I were to go to my mother's house,
      A welcome guest I would be;
    But for the bloody deed that's done this day
      I'll rather go with thee.'

    9
    He lifted her on a milk-white steed
      And himself on a dapple gray;
    They drew their hats out over their face,
      And they both went weeping away.

    10
    They rode, they rode, and they better rode,
      Till they came to yon water wan;
    They lighted down to gie their horse a drink
      Out of the running stream.

    11
    'I am afraid, Earl Douglas.' she said,
      'I am afraid ye are slain;
    I think I see your bonny heart's blood
      Running down the water wan.'

    12
    'Oh no, oh no, fair Margaret,' he said,
      'Oh no, I am not slain;
    It is but the scad of my scarlet cloak
      Runs down the water wan.'

    13
    He mounted her on a milk-white steed
      And himself on a dapple gray,
    And they have reached Earl Douglas' gates
      Before the break of day.

    14
    'O rise, dear mother, and make my bed,
      And make it braid and wide,
    And lay me down to take my rest,
      And at my back my bride.'

    15
    She has risen and made his bed,
      She made it braid and wide;
    She laid him down to take his rest,
      And at his back his bride.

    16
    Lord William died ere it was day,
      Lady Margaret on the morrow;
    Lord William died through loss of blood and wounds,
      Fair Margaret died with sorrow.

    17
    The one was buried in Mary's kirk,
      The other in Mary's quire;
    The one sprung up a bonnie bush,
      And the other a bonny brier.

    18
    These twa grew, and these twa threw,
      Till they came to the top,
    And when they could na farther gae,
      They coost the lovers' knot.

      Sleepst thou or wakst thou, I say?
    Rise up, make a match for your eldest daughter,
      For the youngest I carry away.'

    2
    'Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,

    For it ne'er shall be said that a churlish knight

    'Loup aff, loup aff, Lady Margaret,' he said,
      'And hold my steed in your hand,
    And I will go fight your seven brethren,
      And your father, where they stand.'

    4
    Sometimes she gaed, sometimes she stood,
      But never dropt a tear,
    Until she saw her brethren all slain
      And her father who lovd her so dear.

    5
    'Hold thy hand, sweet William,' she says,
      'Thy blows are wondrous sore;
    Sweethearts I may have many a one,
      But a father I'll never have more.'

    6
    O she's taken her napkin frae her pocket,
      Was made o the holland fine,
    And ay as she dichted her father's bloody wounds,
      They sprang as red as the wine.

    7
    'Two chooses, two chooses, Lady Margret,' he says,
      'Two chooses I'll make thee;
    Whether to go back to your mother again,
      Or go along with me.'

    8
    'For to go home to my mother again,
      An unwelcome guest I'd be;
    But since my fate has ordered it so,
      I'll go along with thee.'

    9
    He has mounted her on a milk-white steed,
      Himself on the dapple gray,
    And blawn his horn baith loud and shill,
      And it sounded far on their way.

    10
    They rode oer hill, they rode oer dale,
      They rode oer mountains so high,
    Until they came to that beautiful place
      Where Sir William's mother did lie.

    11
    'Rise up, rise up, lady mother,' he said,
      'Rise up, and make much o your own;
    Rise up, rise up, lady mother,' he said,
      'For his bride's just new come home.'

    12
    Sir William he died in the middle o the night,
      Lady Margaret died on the morrow;
    Sir William he died of pure pure love,
      Lady Margaret of grief and sorrow.

    He has lookit over his left shoulder,
      And through his bonnie bridle rein,
    And he spy'd her father and her seven bold brethren,
      Come riding down the glen.

    'O hold my horse, Lady Margret,' he said,
      'O hold my horse by the bonnie bridle rein,

[107] 'Erlinton,' though not existing in a two-line stanza, follows
immediately after 'Earl Brand.' The copy of 'The Douglas Tragedy' in
Smith's Scottish Minstrel, III, 86, is merely Scott's, with changes to
facilitate singing.

Grundtvig from No 82, and assigned to No 249. See #D. g. F#. IV, 494.

[109] Though the paradise has not been transmitted in any known copy of
'Earl Brand,' it appears very distinctly in the opening stanza of
'Leesome Brand' #A#. This last has several stanzas towards the close
(33-35) which seem to belong to 'Earl Brand,' and perhaps derived these,
the "unco land," and even its name, by the familiar process of
intermixture of traditions.

stand by my love, sword in hand," with Norwegian #A#, 29, 30: "Shall we
ride to the wood, or shall we bide like men?" "We will not ride to the
wood, but we will bide like men." And also with Danish #[AE]#, sts 14, 15.

[112] The chief branches, besides the Helgi lay and Walter, are
the saga in Snorri's Edda, Sk['a]ldskaparmal, [S] 50; that in Saxo
Grammaticus, Stephanius, ed. 1644, pp. 88-90; S[:o]rla [th]['a]ttr,
in Fornaldar S[:o]gur, I, 391 ff; the Shetland ballad printed in
Low's Tour through the Islands of Orkney and Shetland, 108 ff,
and in Barry's History of the Orkney Islands, 2d ed., 489 ff, and
paraphrased in Hibbert's Description of the Shetland Islands, 561 ff;
the Thidrik saga, [S][S] 233-239, Unger; Gudrun, v-viii. The names
of father, daughter, and lover in these are: (1) H[:u]gni, ----,
H[:o]gni, H[:o]gin-, H[:o]gni, ----, [Artus], Hagen; (2) [Sigr['u]n],
Hilde-gunde, Hildr, Hilda, Hildr, Hildina, Hildr, Hilde; (3) Helgi,
[Walter], Hedin, Hithin-, Hedin, ----, [Herburt], Hetel. Hagan,
in 'Waltharius,' may be said to take the place of the father, who
is wanting; and this is in a measure true also of Hedin, Helgi's
half-brother, in the lay of Helgi Hi[:o]rvard's son. See the excellent
discussion of the saga by Klee, Zur Hildesage, Leipzig, 1873.

The Swedish ballad, 'Herr Hjelmer,' #A#, Arwidsson, I, 155, No 21; #B#,
#C#, Afzelius, II, 178, 226, No 74 (Helmer); #D#, #E#. Wigstr[:o]m,
Folkdiktning, p. 25, No 10 (Hjelman), has several points of agreement
with Ribold and the Hilde saga. The hero kills six of seven brothers
[also the father, in #A#], spares the seventh on oath of fidelity, and
is treacherously slain by him. The youngest brother carries her lover's
head to his sister, is invited to drink by her (in three of the four
copies), and slain while so engaged; reminding us of Hildina in the
Shetland ballad. Danish 'Herr Hj[ae]lm,' Grundtvig, Danske Folkeminder,
1861, p. 81, agrees with the Swedish, except that there are only three
brothers.

Guldborg, #A# 33, 34, #B# 46, #D# 46, 47, #E# 42, #Q# 24. The
observation is Professor Bugge's.

[114] H[:o]ttr, er ['O][dh]inn var reyndar, Hood, who was Odin really,
Fornaldar S[:o]gur, II, p. 25. Klee observes, p. 10 f, that H[:o]gni
[Hagen] is the evil genius of the Hildesage. Sometimes he is the
heroine's father; in 'Waltharius,' strangely enough, the hero's old
friend (and even there a one-eyed man.) Klee treats the introduction
of a rival lover (as in the Shetland ballad and Gudrun) as a departure
from the older story. But we have the rival in Helgi Hundingslayer.
The proper marplot in this lay is Blind the Ill-witted (Odin), whose
part is sustained in 'Earl Brand' by the malicious Hood, in several
Norwegian ballads by a very enigmatical "false P['a]l greive," in two
other Norwegian ballads and one Danish by an old man, and, what is most
remarkable, in the Shetland ballad by the rejected lover of Hildina
(the Sir Nilaus of Danish #D#, Hertug Nilss['o]n of some Norwegian
copies), who bears the name Hiluge, interpreted with great probability
by Conrad Hofmann (Munich Sitzungsberichte, 1867, II, 209, note),

ERLINTON

        #A.# 'Erlinton,' Scott's Minstrelsy, III, 235, ed. 1803.

        #B.# 'True Tammas,' Mr R. White's papers.

        #C.# 'Robin Hood and the Tanner's Daughter,' Gutch's Robin
        Hood, II, 345.


'Erlinton' (#A#) first appeared in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, the text formed "from the collation of two copies obtained from
recitation." #B# is a manuscript copy, furnished by the late Mr Robert
White of Newcastle, and was probably taken down from recitation by Mr
James Telfer early in the century. #C#, in which Robin Hood has taken
the place of a hero who had at least _connections_ out of Great Britain,
was first printed in Gutch's Robin Hood, from a manuscript of Mr Payne
Collier, supposed to have been written about 1650.

This ballad has only with much hesitation been separated from the
foregoing. In this as in that, a man induces a maid to go off with him;
he is set upon by a party of fifteen in #A#, #B#, as in 7 #A#; and he
spares the life of one of his assailants [an old man, #A#, #B#, the
younger brother, #C#]. Some agreements as to details with Scandinavian
Ribold ballads have already been noticed, and it has been observed that
while there is no vestige of the dead-naming in 'Earl Brand,' there is
an obvious trace of it in 'Erlinton' #A#, #B#. 'Erlinton' #A#, #B# has
also one other correspondence not found in 'Earl Brand,'--the strict
watch kept over the lady (st. 2). Even the bigly bower, expressly built
to confine her in, is very likely a reminiscence or a displacement of
the tower in which Hilde is shut up, _after_ her elopement, in some of
the Scandinavian ballads (Danish 83 #A#, #B#; Swedish #A#, dark house).
But notwithstanding these resemblances to the Ribold story, there is a
difference in the larger part of the details, and all the 'Erlinton'
ballads have a fortunate conclusion, which also does not seem forced, as
it does in Arwidsson, 107, the only instance, perhaps, in which a
fortunate conclusion in a Ribold ballad is of the least account; for
Grundtvig's #F#, #G# are manifestly copies that have been tampered with,
and Landstad 34 is greatly confused at the close. It may be an absolute
accident, but 'Erlinton' #A#, #B# has at least one point of contact with
the story of Walter of Aquitania which is not found in 'Earl Brand.'
This story requires to be given in brief on account of its kinship to
both.

Walter, with his betrothed Hildegunde, fly from the court of Attila, at
which they have both lived as hostages since their childhood, taking
with them two boxes of jewels. Gunther, king of Worms, learns that a
knight and lady, with a richly-laden horse, have passed the Rhine, and
sets out in pursuit, with twelve of his best fighting men, resolved to
capture the treasure. The fugitives, after a very long ride, make a halt
in a forest, and Walter goes to sleep with his head on Hildegunde's
knees. The lady meanwhile keeps watch, and rouses her lover when she
perceives by the dust they raise that horsemen are approaching. Gunther
sends one of his knights with a message demanding the surrender of the
treasure. Walter scornfully refuses, but expresses a willingness to make
the king a present of a hundred bracelets, or rings, of red gold, in
token of his respect. The messenger is sent back with directions to take
the treasure by force, if it should be refused again. Walter, having
vainly offered a present of two hundred bracelets to avoid a conflict,
is attacked by the knight, whom he slays. Ten others go the way of this
first, and only the king and one of his troop, Hagen, a very
distinguished knight and an old comrade of Walter, remain. These now
attack Walter; the combat is long and fierce; all three are seriously
wounded, and finally so exhausted as to be forced to cease fighting.
Walter and Hagen enter into a friendly talk while refreshing themselves
with wine, and in the end Gunther[117] is put on a horse and conducted
home by Hagen, while Walter and Hildegunde continue their journey to
Aquitania. There they were married and ruled thirty happy years.
('Waltharius,' ed. R. Peiper, 1873.)

The particular resemblances of 'Erlinton' #A#, #B# to 'Walter' are that
the assailants are "bold knights," or "bravest outlaws," _not_ the
lady's kinsmen; that there are two parleys before the fight; and that
the hero survives the fight and goes off with his love. The utmost that
could be insisted on is that some features of the story of Walter have
been blended in the course of tradition with the kindred story of
Ribold. 'Erlinton' #C# is much less like 'Walter,' and more like
'Ribold.'

The 'Sultan's Fair Daughter,' translated by Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, p. 93, 2d ed., has perhaps derived something from the
Walter story. Two Magyars escape from the Sultan's prison by the aid of
his daughter, under promise of taking her to Hungary. She often looks
backwards, fearing pursuit. At last a large band overtake them. One of
the Magyars guards the lady; the other assaults the Turks, of whom he
leaves only one alive, to carry back information. One of the two has a
love at home; the other takes the Sultan's daughter.

    Erlinton had a fair daughter;

    3
    She hadna been i that bigly bower
      Na not a night but barely ane,
    Till there was Willie, her ain true love,

    But I'll come to the green-wood the morn,
      Whar blooms the brier, by mornin dawn.'

    6
    Then she's gane to her bed again,
      Where she has layen till the cock crew thrice,
    Then she said to her sisters a',
      'Maidens, 't is time for us to rise.'

    7
    She pat on her back her silken gown,
      An on her breast a siller pin,
    An she's tane a sister in ilka hand,

    He took her sisters by the hand,
      He kissd them baith, an sent them hame,
    An he's taen his true love him behind,
      And through the green-wood they are gane.

    10
    They hadna ridden in the bonnie green-wood
      Na not a mile but barely ane,
    When there came fifteen o the boldest knights
      That ever bare flesh, blood, or bane.

    11
    The foremost was an aged knight,
      He wore the grey hair on his chin:
    Says, 'Yield to me thy lady bright,
      An thou shalt walk the woods within.'

    12
    'For me to yield my lady bright
      To such an aged knight as thee,
    People wad think I war gane mad,
      Or a' the courage flown frae me.'

    13
    But up then spake the second knight,
      I wat he spake right boustouslie:
    'Yield me thy life, or thy lady bright,
      Or here the tane of us shall die.'

    14
    'My lady is my warld's meed;
      My life I winna yield to nane;
    But if ye be men of your manhead,
      Ye'll only fight me ane by ane.'

    15
    He lighted aff his milk-white steed,
      An gae his lady him by the head,
    Sayn, 'See ye dinna change your cheer,
      Untill ye see my body bleed.'

    16
    He set his back unto an aik,
      He set his feet against a stane,
    An he has fought these fifteen men,
      An killd them a' but barely ane.

    'My lady fair, O I like her weel, sir,
      An O my life, but it lies me near!
    But before I lose my lady fair, sir,
      I'll rather lose my life sae dear.'

    'O feare me not, thou prettie mayde,
      And doe not flie from mee;
    I am the kindest man,' he said,
      'That ever eye did see.'

    3
    Then to her he did doffe his cap,
      And to her lowted low;
    'To meete with thee I hold it good hap,
      If thou wilt not say noe.'

    4
    Then he put his hand around her waste,
      Soe small, so tight, and trim,
    And after sought her lip to taste,
      And she to kissed him.

    5
    'Where dost thou dwell, my prettie maide?
      I prithee tell to me;'
    'I am a tanner's daughter,' she said,
      'John Hobbes of Barneslee.'

    6
    'And whither goest thou, pretty maide?
      Shall I be thy true love?'
    If thou art not afeard,' she said,
      'My true love thou shalt prove.'

    7
    'What should I feare?' then he replied;
      'I am thy true love now;'
    'I have two brethren, and their pride
      Would scorn such one as thou.'

    8
    'That will we try,' quoth Robin Hood;
      'I was not made their scorne;
    Ile shed my blood to doe the[e] good,
      As sure as they were borne.'

    9
    'My brothers are proude and fierce and strong;'
      'I am,' said he, 'the same,
    And if they offer thee to wrong,
      Theyle finde Ile play their game.

    10
    'Through the free forrest I can run,
      The king may not controll;
    They are but barking tanners' sons,
      To me they shall pay toll.

    11
    'And if not mine be sheepe and kine,
      I have cattle on my land;
    On venison eche day I may dine,
      Whiles they have none in hand.'

    12
    These wordes had Robin Hood scarce spoke,
      When they two men did see,
    Come riding till their horses smoke:
      'My brothers both,' cried shee.

    13
    Each had a good sword by his side,
      And furiouslie they rode
    To where they Robin Hood espied,
      That with the maiden stood.

    14
    'Flee hence, flee hence, away with speede!'
      Cried she to Robin Hood,
    'For if thou stay, thoult surely bleede;
      I could not see thy blood.'

    15
    'With us, false maiden, come away,
      And leave that outlawe bolde;
    Why fledst thou from thy home this day,
      And left thy father olde?'

    16
    Robin stept backe but paces five,
      Unto a sturdie tree;
    'Ile fight whiles I am left alive;
      Stay thou, sweete maide, with mee.'

    17
    He stood before, she stoode behinde,
      The brothers two drewe nie;
    'Our sister now to us resign,
      Or thou full sure shalt die.'

    18
    Then cried the maide, 'My brethren deare,
      With ye Ile freely wend,
    But harm not this young forrester,
      Noe ill doth he pretend.'

    19
    'Stande up, sweete maide, I plight my troth;
      Fall thou not on thy knee;
    Ile force thy cruell brothers both
      To bend the knee to thee.

    20
    'Stand thou behinde this sturdie oke,
      I soone will quell their pride;
    Thoult see my sword with furie smoke,
      And in their hearts' blood died.'

    21
    He set his backe against a tree,
      His foote against a stone;
    The first blow that he gave so free
      Cleft one man to the bone.

    22
    The tanners bold they fought right well,
      And it was one to two;
    But Robin did them both refell,
      All in the damsell's viewe.

    23
    The red blood ran from Robins brow,
      All downe unto his knee;
    'O holde your handes, my brethren now,
      I will goe backe with yee.'

    24
    'Stand backe, stand backe, my pretty maide,
      Stand backe and let me fight;
    By sweete St. James be no[t] afraide
      But I will it requite.'

    25
    Then Robin did his sword uplift,
      And let it fall againe;
    The oldest brothers head it cleft,
      Right through unto his braine.

    26
    'O hold thy hand, bolde forrester,
      Or ill may thee betide;
    Slay not my youngest brother here,
      He is my father's pride.'

    27
    'Away, for I would scorne to owe,
      My life to the[e], false maide!'
    The youngest cried, and aimd a blow
      That lit on Robin's head.

    28
    Then Robin leand against the tree,
      His life nie gone did seeme;
    His eyes did swim, he could not see
      The maiden start betweene.

    29
    It was not long ere Robin Hood
      Could welde his sword so bright;
    Upon his feete he firmly stood,
      And did renew the fight.

    30
    Untill the tanner scarce could heave
      His weapon in the aire;
    But Robin would not him bereave
      Of life, and left him there.

    31
    Then to the greenewood did he fly,
      And with him went the maide;
    For him she vowd that she would dye,
      He'd live for her, he said.

The earliest copy of this ballad is introduced as 'The Maidens'
Song,'[119] in Deloney's Pleasant History of John Winchcomb, in his
younger yeares called Jacke of Newberie, a book written as early as
1597. Mr Halliwell reprinted the "9th" edition, of the date 1633,[120]
in 1859, and the ballad is found at p. 61 of the reprint (#A#). The copy
in Ritson's Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 169, has a few variations, which are
probably to be explained by Ritson having used some other edition of
Deloney. Ritson's text is used in The Borderer's Table Book, VI, 25,
and was taken thence into Sheldon's Minstrelsy of the English Border,
with some arbitrary alterations. The ballad was formerly popular in
Scotland. Kinloch and Buchan printed #B# and #C# with some slight
changes; the texts are now given as they stand in the manuscripts. #E#,
a traditional version from the English border, has unfortunately been
improved by some literary pen.

An English lady is prevailed upon to release a Scot from prison, and to
fly with him, on the promise of being made his wife, and (#A#) lady of
castles and towers. She takes much gold with her (#A#), and a swift
steed (two, #A#). According to #A# they come to a rough river; the lady
is alarmed, but swims it, and is wet from top to toe. On coming within
sight of Edinburgh, the faithless knight bids her choose whether she
will be his paramour or go back: he has wife and children. She begs him
to draw his sword and end her shame: he takes her horse away, and leaves
her. Two English knights come by, who restore her to her father. The
dismissal takes place at the Scottish cross and moor in #B#; at a moor
and a moss, #C#; at Scotland bridge, #D#; at a fair Scottish cross, #E#.
She offers to be servant in his kitchen rather than go back, #B#, #C#,
#E#; begs him to throw her into the water, #D#; from his castle wall,
#E#. He fees an old man to take her home on an old horse, #B#, #E#.

We do not find the whole of this story repeated among other European
nations, but there are interesting agreements in parts with
Scandinavian, Polish, and German ballads.

There is some resemblance in the first half to a pretty ballad of the
northern nations which treats in a brief way the theme of our exquisite
romance of 'The Nutbrown Maid:' #Danish#, 'Den Trofaste Jomfru,'
Grundtvig, No 249, IV, 494, nine copies, #A-I#, the first three from
16th or 17th century manuscripts, the others from tradition of this
century, as are also the following: #K-M#, 'Den Fredl[/o]se,' Kristensen,
II, 191, No 57: Swedish, 'De sju Gullbergen,' #A#, Afzelius, No 79, III,
71, new ed., No 64, I, 322; #B#, #C#, Grundtvig, IV, 507 f: #Norwegian#
#A#, 'Herre Per og stolt Margit,' Landstad, No 74, p. 590; #B#, 'Herr'
Nikelus,' Landstad, No 75, p. 594.[121] All tell very much the same
tale. A knight carries off a maid on his horse, making her magnificent
promises, among which are eight gold castles, Dan. #C#, #D#, #E#, #H#,
#I#; one, #K#, #L#, #M#; eight, Norw. #A#; nine, Norw. #B#; seven, Swed.
#B#; seven gold mountains, Swed. #A#, perhaps, by mistake of ber_gen_
for bor_gar_[122] She gets her gold together while he is saddling his
horse, Dan. #A, C, D, F, H, M#; Swed. #A#; Norw. #A#, #B#. They come to
a sea-strand or other water, it is many miles to the nearest land, Dan.
#B#, #D#, Swed. #A#, #C#; the lady wishes she were at home, Dan. #E#,
#F#, Swed. #B#, #C#. He swims the horse across, Dan. #A#, #B#, #D#, #E#,
#F#, #H#, #K#, #L#, #M#; Swed. #A#, #B#, #C# [part of the way, having
started in a boat, Norw. #A#, #B#]. The maid wrings her clothes, Dan.
#A#, #D#, #K#, #L#; Swed. #A#; Norw. #A#, #B#. She asks, Where are the
gold castles which you promised? Dan. #C# 7, #D# 14, #K# 9, #L# 7, #M#
8; Norw. #A# 22, #B# 16.[123] He tells her that he has no gold castle
but this green turf, Dan. #C# 8; he needs none but the black ground and
thick wood, Dan. #K# 10: he is a penniless, banished man. She offers him
her gold to buy him a charter of peace. In all, except Dan. #A#, #B#,
#C#, and the incomplete Dan. #I#, Norw. #B#, he goes on to say that he
has plighted faith to another woman, and she meekly replies, Then I will
be your servant. He continues the trial no further, reveals himself as
of wealth and rank, says that she shall have ladies to wait on her, and
makes her his queen. The knight is king of England in Dan. #B#, #H#,
King Henry, simply, in Dan. #F#. The gold castles prove to be realities:
there is in Dan. #E# even one more than was promised.[124]

The #Polish# ballads of the class of 'Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight'
(see p. 39 f) have thus much in common with 'The Fair Flower of
Northumberland:' a maid is induced to go off with a man on horseback,
and takes gold with her; after going a certain distance, he bids her
return home; in #AA#, #H#, #R#, he gives her her choice whether to
return or to jump into the river; she prefers death (cf. #D# 3, 5, p.
116); in all they finally come to a river, or other water, into which he
throws her.[125]

There is a #German# ballad which has some slight connection with all the
foregoing, and a very slight story it is altogether: 'Stolz Heinrich,'
Simrock, No 9, p. 23, 'Stolz Syburg,' Reiffenberg, No 16, p. 32, No 17,
p. 34, from the Lower Rhine and M[:u]nster; made over, in Kretzschmer, I,
187, No 106. Heinrich, or Syburg, wooes a king's daughter in a distant
land. He asks her to go with him, and says he has seven mills in his
country. "Tell me what they grind," says Margaret, "and I will go with
you." The mills grind sugar and cinnamon, mace and cloves. They come to
a green heath. Margaret thinks she sees the mills gleaming: he tells her
that a green heath is all he has. "Then God have mercy that I have come
so far," she says; draws a sword; kneels before him, and stabs herself.

The ballad of 'Young Andrew,' further on, has points in common with 'The
Fair Flower of Northumberland.'

    1
    It was a knight in Scotland borne
      Follow, my love, come over the strand
    Was taken prisoner, and left forlorne,
      Even by the good Earle of Northumberland.

    2
    Then was he cast in prison strong,
    Where he could not walke nor lie along,
      Even by the goode Earle of Northumberland.

    3
    And as in sorrow thus he lay,
    The Earle's sweete daughter walkt that way,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    4
    And passing by, like an angell bright,
    The prisoner had of her a sight,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    5
    And loud to her this knight did crie,
    The salt teares standing in his eye,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    6
    'Faire lady,' he said, 'take pity on me,
    And let me not in prison dye,
      And you the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    7
    'Faire Sir, how should I take pity on thee,
    Thou being a foe to our countrey,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    8
    'Faire lady, I am no foe,' he said,
    'Through thy sweet love heere was I stayd,
      For thee, the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    9
    'Why shouldst thou come heere for love of me,
    Having wife and children in thy countrie?
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    10
    'I sweare by the blessed Trinitie,
    I have no wife nor children, I,
      Nor dwelling at home in merrie Scotland.

    11
    'If curteously you will set me free,
    I vow that I will marrie thee,
      So soone as I come in faire Scotland.

    12
    'Thou shalt be a lady of castles and towers,
    And sit like a queene in princely bowers,
      When I am at home in faire Scotland.'

    13
    Then parted hence this lady gay,
    And got her father's ring away,
      To helpe this sad knight into faire Scotland.

    14
    Likewise much gold she got by sleight,
    And all to helpe this forlorne knight
      To wend from her father to faire Scotland.

    15
    Two gallant steedes, both good and able,
    She likewise tooke out of the stable,
      To ride with this knight into faire Scotland.

    16
    And to the jaylor she sent this ring,
    The knight from prison forth to bring,
      To wend with her into faire Scotland.

    17
    This token set the prisoner free,
    Who straight went to this faire lady,
      To wend with her into faire Scotland.

    18
    A gallant steede he did bestride,
    And with the lady away did ride,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    19
    They rode till they came to a water cleare:
    'Good Sir, how should I follow you heere,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland?

    20
    'The water is rough and wonderfull deepe,
    An[d] on my saddle I shall not keepe,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    21
    'Feare not the foord, faire lady,' quoth he,
    'For long I cannot stay for thee,
      And thou the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    22
    The lady prickt her wanton steed,
    And over the river swom with speede,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    23
    From top to toe all wet was shee:
    'This have I done for love of thee,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    24
    Thus rode she all one winter's night,
    Till Edenborow they saw in sight,
      The chiefest towne in all Scotland.

    25
    'Now chuse,' quoth he, 'thou wanton flower,
    Whe'r thou wilt be my paramour,
      Or get thee home to Northumberland.

    26
    'For I have wife, and children five,
    In Edenborow they be alive;
      Then get thee home to faire England.

    27
    'This favour shalt thou have to boote,
    Ile have thy horse, go thou on foote,
      Go, get thee home to Northumberland.'

    28
    'O false and faithlesse knight,' quoth shee,
    'And canst thou deale so bad with me,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland?

    29
    'Dishonour not a ladie's name,
    But draw thy sword and end my shame,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.'

    30
    He tooke her from her stately steed,
    And left her there in extreme need,
      And she the faire flower of Northumberland.

    31
    Then sate she downe full heavily;
    At length two knights came riding by,
      Two gallant knights of faire England.

    32
    She fell downe humbly on her knee,
    Saying, 'Courteous knights, take pittie on me,
      And I the faire flower of Northumberland.

    33
    'I have offended my father deere,
    And by a false knight that brought me heere,

    They tooke her up behind them then,
    And brought her to her father's againe,
      And he the good Earle of Northumberland.

    35
    All you faire maidens be warned by me,
    Scots were never true, nor never will be,
      To lord, nor lady, nor faire England.

    The provost's daughter went out a walking,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    She heard a poor prisoner making his moan,
      And she was the fair flower of Northumberland.

    2
    'If any lady would borrow me
      Out into the prison strong,
    I would make her a lady of high degree,
      For I am a great lord in fair Scotland.'

    3
    She's done her to her father's bed-stock,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    She's stolen the keys o many braw lock,
      And she's loosd him out o the prison strong.

    4
    She's done her to her father's stable,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    She's taen out a steed that was both swift and able,
      To carry them both to fair Scotland.

    5
    O when they came to the Scottish cross,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    'Ye brazen-faced whore, light off o my horse,
      And go get you back to Northumberland!'

    6
    O when they came to the Scottish moor,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    'Get off o my horse, you're a brazen-faced whore,
      So go get you back to Northumberland!'

    7
    'O pity on me, O pity,' said she,
      'O that my love was so easy won!
    Have pity on me as I had upon thee,
      When I loosd you out of the prison strong.'

    8
    'O how can I have pity on thee?
      O why was your love so easy won!
    When I have a wife and children three
      More worthy than a' Northumberland.'

    9
    'Cook in your kitchen I will be,
      O that my love was so easy won!
    And serve your lady most reverently,
      For I darena go back to Northumberland.'

    10
    'Cook in my kitchen you shall not be,
      Why was your love so easy won!
    For I will have no such servants as thee,
      So get you back to Northumberland.'

    11
    But laith was he the lassie to tyne,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    He's hired an old horse and feed an old man,
      To carry her back to Northumberland.

    12
    O when she came her father before,
      A may's love whiles is easy won
    She fell down on her knees so low
      For she was the fair flower of Northumberland.

    13
    'O daughter, O daughter, why was ye so bold,
      Or why was your love so easy won,
    To be a Scottish whore in your fifteen year old?
      And you the fair flower of Northumberland!'

    14
    Her mother she gently on her did smile,
      O that her love was so easy won!
    'She is not the first that the Scotts have beguild,
      But she's still the fair flower of Northumberland.

    As I went by a jail-house door,
      Maid's love whiles is easy won
    I saw a prisoner standing there,
      'I wish I were home in fair Scotland.

    2
    'Fair maid, will you pity me?
    Ye'll steal the keys, let me gae free:
      I'll make you my lady in fair Scotland.

    3
    'I'm sure you have no need of me,
    For ye have a wife and bairns three,
      That lives at home in fair Scotland.'

    4
    He swore by him that was crownd with thorn,
    That he never had a wife since the day he was born,
      But livd a free lord in fair Scotland.

    5
    She went unto her father's bed-head,
    She's stown the key o mony a lock,
      She's let him out o prison strong.

    6
    She's went to her father's stable,
    She's stown a steed baith wight and able,
      To carry them on to fair Scotland.

    They rode till they came to a muir,
    He bade her light aff, they'd call her a whore,
      If she didna return to Northumberland.

    8
    They rode till they came to a moss,
    He bade her light aff her father's best horse,
      And return her again to Northumberland.

    'I'm sure I have no need of thee,
    When I have a wife and bairns three,

    'I'll be cook in your kitchen,
    And serve your lady handsomelie,
      For I darena gae back to Northumberland.'

    'Ye cannot be cook in my kitchen,
    My lady cannot fa sic servants as thee,
      So ye'll return again to Northumberland.'

    12
    When she went thro her father's ha,
    She looted her low amongst them a',
      She was the fair flower o Northumberland.

    13
    Out spake her father, he spake bold,
    'How could ye be a whore in fifteen years old,
      And you the flower of Northumberland?'

        Tyne. 20 copies printed." _Mr White's note._


[119] "Two of them singing the dittie," says Deloney, "and all the rest
bearing the burden."

[120] The earliest edition now known to exist is of 1619.

[121] Some of these ballads begin with stanzas which are found also in
Kvindemorderen and Ribold ballads (our No 4, No 7), where also a young
woman is carried off furtively by a man. This is only what is to be
expected.

[122] By mistake, most probably. But in one of the Polish ballads, cited
a little further on, #Q# (Kolberg, P. 1. Polskiego, 5 pp), the maid is
told, "In my country the mountains are golden, the mountains are of
gold."

[123] So 'Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight,' #D# 11:

    'Is this your bowers and lofty towers?'

[124] There is a similarity, which is perhaps not accidental, between
these Scandinavian ballads and 'Child Waters.' Child Waters makes Ellen
swim a piece of water, shows her his hall--"of red gold shines the
tower"--where the fairest lady is his paramour, subjects her to menial
services, and finally, her patience withstanding all trials, marries
her.

[125] They pass the water in #Q# only, and that in a boat. She is thrown
in from a bridge in #V#, #W#, the bridge of Cracow in #C#: cf. Scotland
bridge, #D# 2 of this ballad. By a curious accident, it is at a wayside
crucifix that the man begins his change of demeanor in Polish #CC# 2
(Kolberg, #ddd#), as in #B# 5, #E# 7, of this ballad, it is at a
Scottish cross.

This is one of the very few old ballads which are not extinct as
tradition in the British Isles. Even drawing-room versions are spoken of
as current, "generally traced to some old nurse, who sang them to the
young ladies."[126] It has been found in England, Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland, and was very early in print. Dr Rimbault possessed and
published a broadside of the date 1656[127] (#A a#), and the same copy
is included in the miscellany called Wit Restor'd, 1658. Both of these
name "Mr Smith" as the author; that is, Dr James Smith, a well-known
writer of humorous verses, to whom the larger part of the pieces in Wit
Restor'd has been attributed. If the ballad were ever in Smith's hands,
he might possibly have inserted the three burlesque stanzas, 11-13; but
similar verses are found in another copy (#L a#), and might easily be
extemporized by any singer of sufficiently bad taste. Wit and Drollery,
the edition of 1682, has an almost identical copy of the ballad, and
this is repeated in Dryden's Miscellany, edition of 1716, Part III, p.
316. In 1781 Pinkerton inserted in his Tragic Ballads one with the title
'Binnorie,' purporting to be from Scottish tradition. Of twenty-eight
couplets, barely seven are genuine. Scott printed in 1802 a copy (#C#)
compounded from one "in Mrs Brown's MS." (#B b#) and a fragment of
fourteen stanzas which had been transcribed from recitation by Miss
Charlotte Brooke, adopting a burden found in neither.[128] Jamieson
followed, four years after, with a tolerably faithful, though not, as he
says, _verbatim_, publication of his copy of Mrs Brown's ballad,
somewhat marred, too, by acknowledged interpolations. This text of Mrs
Brown's is now correctly given, with the whole or fragments of eleven
others, hitherto unpublished.

The ballad is as popular with the Scandinavians as with their Saxon
cousins. Grundtvig, 'Den talende Strengeleg,' No 95, gives nine #Danish#
versions and one stanza of a tenth; seven, #A-E#, in II, 507 ff, the
remainder, #H-K#, in III, 875 ff. One more, #L#, is added by Kristensen,
No 96, I, 253. Of these, only #E# had been previously printed. All are
from tradition of this century.

There are two #Icelandic# versions, #A# from the 17th, #B# from the
19th, century, printed in ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, No 13, 'H[:o]rpu
kv[ae][dh]i.'

Of twelve #Norwegian# versions, #A#, by Moe, "is printed in Norske
Universitets og Skole-Annaler for 1850, p. 287," and in Moe's
Samlede Skrifter, II, 118, 'D[ae] bur ein Mann h[ae]r utm[ae] Aa;'
#B#, by Lindeman, Annaler, as before, "p. 496," and in his Norske
Fjeldmelodier, vol. I, Tekst-Bilag, p. 4, No 14, 'Dei tv[ae] Systa;'
#C#, by Landstad, 'Dei tvo systar,' No 53, p. 480; #D-L# are described
by Professor Bugge in Grundtvig, III, 877 f; #M# "is printed in
Illustreret Nyhedsblads Nytaarsgave for 1860, p. 77, Christiania."

Four #F[:a]r[:o]e# versions are known: #A#, 'H[:o]rpur['i]ma,' "in
Svabo's MS., No 16, I, 291," incorrectly printed by Afzelius, I, 86,
and accurately, from a copy furnished by Grundtvig, in Bergstr[:o]m's
edition of Afzelius, II, 69; #B#, a compound of two versions taken down
by Pastor Lyngbye and by Pastor Schr[:o]ter, in Nyeste Skilderie af
Kj[/o]benhavn, 1821, col. 997 ff; #C#, a transcript from recitation by
Hammershaimb (Grundtvig); #D#, "in Fugloyjarb['o]k, No 31."

#Swedish# versions are: #A#, 'Den underbara Harpan,' Afzelius, No
17, I, 81, new ed., No 16, 1, I, 72: #B#, 'De tv[oa] Systrarne,'
Afzelius, No 69, III, 16, new ed., No 16, 2, I, 74: #C#, #D#, #E#,
unprinted copies in Cavallius and Stephens's collection: #F#, 'De
tv[oa] Systrarne,' Arwidsson, No 99, II, 139: #G#, 'Systermordet,' E.
Wigstr[:o]m, Sk[oa]nska Visor, p. 4, and the same, Folkdiktning, etc.,
No 7, p. 19: #H#, Rancken, N[oa]gra Prof af Folks[oa]ng, No 3, p. 10.
Afzelius, moreover, gives variations from four other copies which he
had collected, III, 20 ff, new ed., II, 74 ff; and Rancken from three
others. Both of the editors of the new Afzelius have recently obtained
excellent copies from singers. The ballad has also been found in
Finnish, Bergstr[:o]m's Afzelius, II, 79.

There is a remarkable agreement between the Norse and English ballads
till we approach the conclusion of the story, with a natural diversity
as to some of the minuter details.

The sisters are king's daughters in English #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#, #O# (?),
#P#, #Q#, #R a#, and in Swedish #B# and two others of Afzelius's
versions. They are an earl's daughters in Swedish #F#, and sink to
farmer's daughters in English #R b#, #c#,[129] Swedish #A#, #G#,
Norwegian #C#.

It is a thing made much of in most of the Norse ballads that the younger
sister is fair and the older dark; the younger is bright as the sun, as
white as ermine or as milk, the elder black as soot, black as the earth,
Icelandic #A#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #G#, Danish #A#, #D#, etc.; and this
difference is often made the ground for very unhandsome taunts, which
qualify our compassion for the younger; such as Wash all day, and you
will be no whiter than God made you, Wash as white as you please, you
will never get a lover, F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#, Norwegian #A#, #C#, etc. This
contrast may possibly be implied in "the youngest was the fairest
flower," English #F#, #G#, #Q# ["sweetest," #D#], but is expressed only
in #M#, "Ye was fair and I was din" (dun), and in #P a#, "The old was
black and the young are fair."

The scene of action is a seashore in Icelandic and F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#,
Norwegian #A#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #G#, #H#, and in all the Danish
complete copies: a seashore, or a place where ships come in, in English
#A#, #B a#, #D-I#, #Q#, #R a#, #T#, but in all save the last of these
(the last is only one stanza) we have the absurdity of a body drowned in
navigable water being discovered floating down a mill-stream.[130] #B c#
has "the deep mill-dam;" #C# "the river-strand," perhaps one of Scott's
changes; #M#, "the dams;" #L#, #O#, #P#, #R b c#, a river, Tweed
mill-dam, or the water of Tweed. Norwegian #B# has a river.

The pretence for the older sister's taking the younger down to the
water is in English #A-E#, #G#, #H#, #I#, #O#, #Q#, to see their
father's ships come in; in Icelandic #B# to wash their silks;[131] in
most of the Norse ballads to wash themselves, so that, as the elder
says, "we may be alike white," Danish #C-H#, Norwegian #A#, #C#,
Swedish #F#, #G#, F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#. Malice prepense is attributed
to the elder in Swedish #B#, #F#, Norwegian C, Danish #E#, #F#, #G#:
but in F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#, Norwegian #A#, #B#, and perhaps some other
cases, a previous evil intent is not certain, and the provocations of
the younger sister may excuse the elder so far.

The younger is pushed from a stone upon which she sits, stands, or
steps, in English #B#, #C#, #E-H#, #M#, #O#, #Q#, Icelandic #A#, #B#,
F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#, Norwegian #A#, #B#, #C#, Danish #A-E#, #H#, #L#,
Swedish #G#, #H#, and Rancken's other copies.

The drowning scene is the same in all the ballads, except as to one
point. The younger sister, to save her life, offers or consents to
renounce her lover in the larger number, as English #B-E#, #G#, #H#,
#I#, #M#, #P#, #Q#, Danish #A-D#, #F#, #G#, #I#, Swedish #A-D#, #G#,
#H#; and in Icelandic #B# and "all the F[:a]r[:o]e" ballads she finally
yields, after first saying that her lover must dispose of himself. But
Swedish #F#, with more spirit, makes the girl, after promising
everything else, reply:

    'Help then who can, help God above!
    But ne'er shalt thou get my dear true-love.'

In this refusal concur Icelandic #A#, Danish #E#, #H#, #L#, and all the
Norwegian versions except #L#.

Swedish #A#, #G#, and Rancken's versions (or two of them) make the
younger sister, when she sees that she must drown, send greetings to her
father, mother, true-love [also brother, sister, Rancken], and add in
each case that she is drinking, or dancing, her bridal in the flood,
that her bridal-bed is made on the white-sand, etc.

The body of the drowned girl is discovered, in nearly all the English
ballads, by some member of the miller's household, and is taken out of
the water by the miller. In #L b#, which, however, is imperfect at the
beginning, a harper finds the body. In the Icelandic ballads it is found
on the seashore by the lover; in all the Norwegian but #M# by two
fishermen, as also in Swedish #D# [fishermen in Swedish #B#]; in all the
F[:a]r[:o]e versions and Norwegian #M# by two "pilgrims;"[132] in Danish
#A-F#, #L#, and Swedish #C# by two musicians, Danish #H#, Swedish #A#,
#G#, one. Danish #G#, which is corrupted at the close, has three
musicians, but these simply witness and report the drowning.

According to all complete and uncorrupted forms of the ballad, either
some part of the body of the drowned girl is taken to furnish a musical
instrument, a harp or a viol,[133] or the instrument is wholly made from
the body. This is done in the Norse ballads by those who first find the
body, save in Swedish #B#, where fishermen draw the body ashore, and a
passing "speleman" makes the instrument. In English it is done by the
miller, #A#; by a harper, #B#, #C#, #G#, #L b# (the _king's_ harper in
#B#); by a fiddler, #D#, #E#, #I#, #L a# (?), #O#, #P# (the _king's_
fiddler, #O# (?), #P#); by both a fiddler and the king's harper, #H#; in
#F# by the father's herdsman, who happens to be a fiddler.

Perhaps the original conception was the simple and beautiful one which
we find in English #B# and both the Icelandic ballads, that the king's
harper, or the girl's lover, takes three locks of her yellow hair to
string his harp with. So we find three tets of hair in #D#, #E#, #I#,
and three links in #F#, #P#, used, or directed to be used, to string
the fiddle or the fiddle-bow, and the same, apparently, with Danish
#A#. Infelicitous additions were, perhaps, successively made; as a
harp-frame from the breast-bone in English #C#, and fiddle-pins formed
of the finger-joints, English #F#, #O#, Danish #B#, #C#, #E#, #F#,
#L#. Then we have all three: the frame of the instrument formed from
the breast (or trunk), the screws from the finger-joints, the strings
from the hair, Swedish #A#, #B#, #G#, Norwegian #A#, #C#, #M#. And so
one thing and another is added, or substituted, as fiddle-bows of the
arms or legs, Swedish #C#, #D#, Danish #H#, English #L a#; a harp-frame
from the arms, Norwegian #B#, F[:a]r[:o]e #A#; a fiddle-frame from the
skull, Swedish #C#, or from the back-bone, English #L b#; a _plectrum_
from the arm, F[:a]r[:o]e #B#; strings from the veins, English #A#; a
bridge from the nose, English #A#, #L a#; "h[/o]rp[/o]nota" from the
teeth, Norwegian #B#; till we end with the buffoonery of English #A#
and #L a#.

Swedish #H# has nothing about the finding of the body. Music is wanted
for the bridal, and a man from another village, who undertakes to
furnish it, looks three days for a proper tree to make a harp of. The
singer of this version supplied the information, lost from the ballad,
that the drowned sister had floated ashore and grown up into a linden,
and that this was the very tree which was chosen for the harp. (See,
further on, a Lithuanian, a Slovak, and an Esthonian ballad.)

All the Norse ballads make the harp or fiddle to be taken to a wedding,
which chances to be that of the elder sister with the drowned girl's
betrothed.[134] Unfortunately, many of the English versions are so
injured towards the close that the full story cannot be made out. There
is no wedding-feast preserved in any of them. The instrument, in #A#,
#B#, #C#, #H#, is taken into the king's presence. The viol in #A# and
the harp in #H# are expressly said to speak. The harp is laid upon a
stone in #C#, #J#, and plays "its lone;" the fiddle plays of itself in
#L b#.[135] #B# makes the harper play, and #D#, #F#, #K#, #O#, which say
the fiddle played, probably mean that there was a fiddler, and so
perhaps with all the Norse versions; but this is not very material,
since in either case the instrument speaks "with most miraculous organ."

There are three strings made from the girl's hair in Icelandic #A#,
#B#, English #B# [veins, English #A#], and the three tets or links
in English #D#, #E#, #F#, #I#, #P# were no doubt taken to make three
strings originally. Corresponding to this are three enunciations of
the instrument in English #A#, #B#, #C#, Icelandic #A#, F[:a]r[:o]e
#A#,[136] #B#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, #G#, #H#, Danish #A#, #D#,
#F#, #I#. These are reduced to two in Icelandic #B#, Danish #B#, #C#,
#H#, #L#, Swedish #D#, and even to one in English #D#, #F#, #I#, #K#,
#O#, but some of these have suffered injury towards the conclusion. The
number is increased to four in Norwegian #B#, to five in Norwegian #A#,
#D#, and even to six in Norwegian #C#, #K#, #M#. The increase is, of
course, a later exaggeration, and very detrimental to the effect. In
those English copies in which the instrument speaks but once,[137] #D#,
#F#, #K#, #O#, and we may add #P#, it expresses a desire for vengeance:
Hang my sister, #D#, #F#, #K#; Ye'll drown my sister, as she's dune
me, #O#; Tell him to burn my sister, #P#. This is found in no Norse
ballad, neither is it found in the earliest English versions. These,
and the better forms of the Norse, reveal the awful secret, directly or
indirectly, and, in the latter case, sometimes note the effect on the
bride. Thus, in Icelandic #B#, the first string sounds, The bride is
our sister; the second, The bride is our murderer. In Danish #B# the
first fiddle plays, The bride is my sister; the second, The bridegroom
is my true-love; in #C#, #H#, the first strain is, The bride has
drowned her sister, the second, Thy sister is driven [blown] to land.
F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#, have: (1) The bride was my sister; (2) The bride
was my murderer; (3) The bridegroom was my true-love. The bride then
says that the harp disturbs her much, and that she lists to hear it no
more. Most impressive of all, with its terse, short lines, is Icelandic
#A#:

    The first string made response:
    'The bride was my sister once.'

    The bride on the bench, she spake:
    'The harp much trouble doth make.'

    The second string answered the other:
    'She is parting me and my lover.'

    Answered the bride, red as gore:
    'The harp is vexing us sore.'

    The canny third string replied:
    'I owe my death to the bride.'

    He made all the harp-strings clang;
    The bride's heart burst with the pang.

This is the wicked sister's end in both of the Icelandic ballads and in
F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#. In Swedish #A#, #G#, at the first stroke on the
harp she laughs; at the second she grows pale [has to be undressed];
upon the third she lay dead in her bed [falls dead on the floor]. She
is burned in Danish #A#, #B#, #C#, #F#, #G#, Swedish #B#, Norwegian
#A#, #B#, #C#, #I#, #M#. In Norwegian #K#, #L#, the younger sister (who
is restored to life) begs that the elder may not be burned, but sent
out of the country (cf. English #R b c#); nevertheless, she is buried
alive in #L#, which is her fate also in #E#, and in other unprinted
versions. A prose comment upon Danish #I# has her stabbed by the
bridegroom.

Norwegian #B# 21 makes the bride, in her confusion at the revelations of
the harp, ask the bridegroom to drive the fiddler out of the house. So
far from complying, the bridegroom orders him mead and wine, and the
bride to the pile. In Norwegian #C# the bride treads on the harper's
foot, then orders the playing to stop; but the bridegroom springs from
the table, and cries, Let the harp have its song out, pays no regard to
the lady's alleging that she has so bad a head that she cannot bear it,
and finally sends her to the pile. So, nearly, Norwegian #A#. In Danish
#A#, #C#, #D#, #H#, #L#, vainly in the first two, the bride tries to
hush the fiddler with a bribe. He endeavors to take back what he has
said in #D#, #L#, declaring himself a drunken fool (the passage is
borrowed from another ballad): still in #L#, though successful for the
nonce, she comes to the stake and wheel some months after. In #H# the
fiddler dashes the instrument against a stone, seemingly to earn his
bribe, but this trait belongs to versions which take the turn of the
Norwegian. In #C# 15 the bride springs from the table, and says, Give
the fiddlers a trifle, and let them go. This explains the last stanza of
English #A# (cf., Norwegian #B# 21):

    Now pay the miller for his payne,
    And let him bee gone in the divel's name.

Swedish #F# has an entirely perverted and feeble conclusion. "A good
man" takes the younger sister from the water, carries her to his house,
revives her, and nurses her till the morrow, and then restores her to
her father, who asks why she is so pale, and why she had not come back
with her sister. She explains that she had been pushed into the water,
"and we may thank this good man that I came home at all." The father
tells the elder that she is a disgrace to her country, and condemns her
to the "blue tower." But her sister intercedes, and a cheerful and
handsome wedding follows.

Swedish #C# and nearly all the Norwegian ballads[138] restore the
drowned girl to life, but not by those processes of the Humane Society
which are successfully adopted by the "arlig man" in Swedish #F#. The
harp is dashed against a stone, or upon the floor, and the girl stands
forth "as good as ever." As Landstad conceives the matter (484, note 7),
the elder sister is a witch, and is in the end burned _as such_. The
white body of the younger is made to take on the appearance of a crooked
log, which the fishermen (who, by the way, are angels in #C#, #E#)
innocently shape into a harp, and the music, vibrating from her hair
"through all her limbs, marrow and bone," acts as a disenchantment.
However this may be, the restoration of the younger sister, like all
good endings foisted on tragedies, emasculates the story.

English #F# 9 has the peculiarity, not noticed elsewhere, that the
drowning girl catches at a broom-root, and the elder sister forces her
to let go her hold.[139] In Swedish #G# she is simply said to swim to an
alder-root. In English #G# 8 the elder drives the younger from the land
with a switch, in #I# 8 pushes her off with a silver wand.

English #O# introduces the _ghost_ of the drowned sister as instructing
her father's fiddler to make a string of her hair and a peg of her
little finger bone, which done, the first spring the fiddle plays, it
says,

    'Ye'll drown my sister as she's dune me.'

#P#, which is disordered at the end, seems to have agreed with #O#. In
#Q# the ghost sends, by the medium of the miller and his daughter,
respects to father, mother, and true-love, adding a lock of yellow hair
for the last. The ghost is found in #N#, Pinkerton's copy, as well, but
there appears to the lover at dead of night, two days after the
drowning. It informs him of the murder, and he makes search for the
body. This is a wide departure from the original story, and plainly a
modern perversion. Another variation, entirely wanting in ancient
authority, appears in #R#, #S#. The girl is not dead when she has
floated down to the mill-dam, and, being drawn out of the water by the
miller, offers him a handsome reward to take her back to her father
[#S#, to throw her in again!]. The miller takes the reward, and pushes
the girl in again, for which he is hanged.[140]

#Q# has a burden partly Gaelic,

    ... ohone and aree (alack and O Lord),
    On the banks of the Banna (White River), ohone and aree,

which may raise a question whether the Scotch burden Binnorie
(pronounced B['i]nnorie, as well as Binn['o]rie) is corrupted from it,
or the corruption is on the other side. Mr Campbell notices as quaint
the reply in stanza 9:

    'I did not put you in with the design
    Just for to pull you out again.'

We have had a similar reply, made under like circumstances, in Polish
versions of No 4: see p. 40, note.

All the Norse versions of this ballad are in two-line stanzas, and all
the English, except #L b# and in part #L a#.

Some of the traits of the English and Norse story are presented by an
Esthonian ballad, 'The Harp,' Neus, Ehstnische Volkslieder, No 13, p.
56. Another version is given in Rosenpl[:a]nter's Beitr[:a]ge zur genauern
Kenntniss der ehstnischen Sprache, Heft 4, 142, and a third, says Neus,
in Ch. H. J. Schlegel's Reisen in mehrere russische Gouvernements, V,
140. A young woman, who tells her own story, is murdered by her
sisters-in-law and buried in a moor. She comes up as a birch, from
which, with the jaw-bone of a salmon, the teeth of a pike, and her own
hair (the account is somewhat confused) a harp is made. The harp is
taken to the hall by the murdered girl's brother, and responds to his
playing with tones of sorrow like those of the bride who leaves father
and mother for the house of a husband.[141]

A Slovak ballad often translated (Talvj, Historical View, etc., p. 392;
Wenzig's Slawische Volkslieder, p. 110, Westslawischer M[:a]rchenschatz,
273, and Bibliothek Slavischer Poesien, p. 134; Lewestam, Polnische
Volksagen und M[:a]rchen, p. 151) comes nearer in some respects. A daughter
is cursed by her mother for not succeeding in drawing water in frosty
weather. Her bucket turns to stone, but she to a maple. Two fiddlers
come by, and, seeing a remarkably fine tree, propose to make of it
fiddles and fiddle-sticks. When they cut into the tree, blood spirts
out. The tree bids them go on, and when they have done, play before the
mother's door, and sing, Here is your daughter, that you cursed to
stone. At the first notes the mother runs to the window, and begs them
to desist, for she has suffered much since she lost her daughter.

The soul of a dead girl speaks through a tree, again, in a Lithuanian
ballad, Nesselmann, Littauische Volkslieder, No 378, p. 320. The girl is
drowned while attempting to cross a stream, carried down to the sea, and
finally thrown ashore, where she grows up a linden. Her brother makes a
pipe from a branch, and the pipe gives out sweet, sad tones. The mother
says, That tone comes not from the linden; it is thy sister's soul, that
hovers over the water. A like idea is met with in another Lithuanian
ballad, Rhesa, Dainos, ed. Kurschat, No 85, p. 231. A sister plucks a
bud from a rose-bush growing over the grave of her brother, who had died
from disappointed love. How fragrant! she exclaims. But her mother
answers, with tears, It is not the rosebud, but the soul of the youth
that died of grief.

Though the range of the ballad proper is somewhat limited, popular tales
equivalent as to the characteristic circumstances are very widely
diffused.

A Polish popular tale, which is, indeed, half song, Wojcicki, Klechdy,
ed. 1851, II, 15 (Lewestam, p. 105), Kolberg, Pie['s]ni ludu Polskiego,
p. 292, No 40 #a#, #b#, #c#, approaches very close to the English-Norse
ballad. There were three sisters, all pretty, but the youngest far
surpassing the others. A young man from the far-off Ukraine fell in with
them while they were making garlands. The youngest pleased him best, and
he chose her for his wife. This excited the jealousy of the eldest, and
a few days after, when they were gathering berries in a wood, she killed
the youngest, notwithstanding the resistance of the second sister,
buried her, and gave out that she had been torn to pieces by wolves.
When the youth came to ask after his love, the murderess told him this
tale, and so won him by her devoted consolations that he offered her his
hand. A willow grew out of the grave of the youngest, and a herdsman
made a pipe from one of its boughs. Blow as he would, he could get no
sound from the pipe but this:

    'Blow on, herdsman, blow! God shall bless thee so.
    The eldest was my slayer, the second tried to stay her.'

The herdsman took the pipe to the house of the murdered girl. The
mother, the father, and the second sister successively tried it, and the
pipe always sang a like song, Blow, mother, blow, etc. The father then
put the pipe into the eldest sister's hands. She had hardly touched it,
when blood spattered her cheeks, and the pipe sang:

    'Blow on, sister, blow: God shall wreak me now.
    Thou, sister, 't was didst slay me, the younger tried to stay thee,'
                                                                     etc.

The murderess was torn by wild horses.

Professor Bugge reports a Norwegian tale, Grundtvig, III, 878, which
resembles the ballad at the beginning. There were in a family two
daughters and a son. One sister was wasteful, the other saving. The
second complained of the first to her parents, and was killed and buried
by the other. Foliage covered the grave, so that it could not be seen,
but on the trees under which the body lay, there grew "strings." These
the brother cut off and adapted to his fiddle, and when he played, the
fiddle said, My sister is killed. The father, having heard the fiddle's
revelation, brought his daughter to confess her act.

There is a series of tales which represent a king, or other personage,
as being afflicted with a severe malady, and as promising that
whichever of his children, commonly three sons, should bring him
something necessary for his cure or comfort should be his heir: (1)
'La Flor del Lilil['a],' Fernan Caballero, L['a]grimas, cap. 4; (2)
'La ca[~n]a del riu de arenas,' Mil['a], Observaciones sobre la
poesia popular, p. 178, No 3; (3) 'Es kommt doch einmal an den Tag,'
M[:u]llenhof, Sagen, u. s. w., p. 495, No 49; (4) 'Vom singenden
Dudelsack,' Gonzenbach, Sicilianische M[:a]rchen, I, 329, No 51.
Or the inheritance is promised to whichever of the children finds
something lost, or rich and rare, a griffin's feather, a golden
branch, a flower: (5) 'Die Greifenfeder,' Schneller, M[:a]rchen und
Sagen aus W[:a]lschtirol, p. 143, No 51; (6) 'La Flanuto,' Blad['e],
Contes et proverbes populaires recueillis en Armagnac, p. 3, No 1;
(7) Wackernagel, in Haupt's Zeitschrift, III, 35, No 3, == 'Das
Todtebeindli,' Colshorn, C. u. Th., M[:a]rchen u. Sagen, p. 193, No
71, == Sutermeister, Kinder-u.-Hausm[:a]rchen aus der Schweiz, p.
119, No 39. Or a king promises his daughter to the man who shall
capture a dangerous wild beast, and the exploit is undertaken by
three brothers [or two]: (8) 'Der singende Knochen,' Grimms, K. u. H.
m[:a]rchen, I, 149, No 28 (1857); (9) 'Die drei Br[:u]der,' Curtze,
Volks[:u]berlieferungen aus dem F[:u]rstenthum Waldeck, p. 53, No
11; (10) 'Der Rohrstengel,' Haltrich, Deutsche Volksm[:a]rchen aus
dem Sachsenlande, u. s. w., p. 225, No 42. With these we may group,
though divergent in some respects, (11) 'Der goldene Apfel,' Toeppen,
Aberglauben aus Masuren, p. 139.[142] In all these tales the youngest
child is successful, and is killed, out of envy, by the eldest or by
the two elder. [There are only two children in (6), (7), (8); in (4)
the second is innocent, as in the Polish tale.] Reeds grow over the
spot where the body is buried (1), (2), (10), (11), or an elder bush
(3), out of which a herdsman makes a pipe or flute; or a white bone
is found by a herdsman, and he makes a pipe or horn of it (5-9); or a
bag-pipe is made of the bones and skin of the murdered youth (4). The
instrument, whenever it is played, attests the murder.

Among the tales of the South African Bechuana, there is one of a younger
brother, who has been killed by an older, immediately appearing as a
bird, and announcing what has occurred. The bird is twice killed, and
the last time burnt and its ashes scattered to the winds, but still
reappears, and proclaims that his body lies by a spring in the desert.
Grimms, K. u. H. m. III, 361. Liebrecht has noted that the fundamental
idea is found in a Chinese drama, 'The Talking Dish,' said to be based
on a popular tale. An innkeeper and his wife kill one of their guests
for his money, and burn the body. The innkeeper collects the ashes and
pounds the bones, and makes a sort of mortar and a dish. This dish
speaks very distinctly, and denounces the murderers. Journal Asiatique,
1851, 4th Series, vol. 18, p. 523.

    And when they came unto the sea-brym,
    The elder did push the younger in.

    3
    'O sister, O sister, take me by the gowne,
    And drawe me up upon the dry ground.'

    4
    'O sister, O sister, that may not bee,
    Till salt and oatmeale grow both of a tree.'

    5
    Somtymes she sanke, somtymes she swam,
    Until she came unto the mill-dam.

    6
    The miller runne hastily downe the cliffe,
    And up he betook her withouten her life.

    7
    What did he doe with her brest-bone?
    He made him a violl to play thereupon.

    8
    What did he doe with her fingers so small?
    He made him peggs to his violl withall.

    9
    What did he doe with her nose-ridge?
    Unto his violl he made him a bridge.

    10
    What did he doe with her veynes so blew?
    He made him strings to his violl thereto.

    11
    What did he doe with her eyes so bright?
    Upon his violl he played at first sight.

    12
    What did he doe with her tongue so rough?
    Unto the violl it spake enough.

    13
    What did he doe with her two shinnes?
    Unto the violl they danc'd Moll Syms.

    14
    Then bespake the treble string,
    'O yonder is my father the king.'

    15
    Then bespake the second string,
    'O yonder sitts my mother the queen.'

    16
    And then bespake the strings all three,
    'O yonder is my sister that drowned mee.'

    17
    'Now pay the miller for his payne,
    And let him bee gone in the divel's name.'

    Wi grief an spite she almos brast.

    She cried upon her sister dear:

    There were two sisters sat in a bour;
      Binnorie, O Binnorie
    There came a knight to be their wooer.
      By the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie

    He courted the eldest with glove and ring,
    But he loed the youngest aboon a' thing.

    3
    He courted the eldest with broach and knife,
    But he loed the youngest aboon his life.

    4
    The eldest she was vexed sair,
    And sore envied her sister fair.

    5
    The eldest said to the youngest ane,
    'Will ye go and see our father's ships come in?'

    6
    She's taen her by the lilly hand,
    And led her down to the river strand.

    7
    The youngest stude upon a stane,
    The eldest came and pushed her in.

    8
    She took her by the middle sma,
    And dashed her bonnie back to the jaw.

    9
    'O sister, sister, reach your hand,
    And ye shall be heir of half my land.'

    10
    'O sister, I'll not reach my hand,
    And I'll be heir of all your land.

    11
    'Shame fa the hand that I should take,
    It's twin'd me and my world's make.'

    12
    'O sister, reach me but your glove,
    And sweet William shall be your love.'

    13
    'Sink on, nor hope for hand or glove,
    And sweet William shall better be my love.

    14
    'Your cherry cheeks and your yellow hair
    Garrd me gang maiden evermair.'

    15
    Sometimes she sunk, and sometimes she swam,
    Until she came to the miller's dam.

    16
    'O father, father, draw your dam,
    There's either a mermaid or a milk-white swan.'

    17
    The miller hasted and drew his dam,
    And there he found a drowned woman.

    18
    You could not see her yellow hair,
    For gowd and pearls that were sae rare.

    19
    You could na see her middle sma,
    Her gowden girdle was sae bra.

    20
    A famous harper passing by,
    The sweet pale face he chanced to spy.

    21
    And when he looked that ladye on,
    He sighed and made a heavy moan.

    22
    He made a harp of her breast-bone,
    Whose sounds would melt a heart of stone.

    23
    The strings he framed of her yellow hair,
    Whose notes made sad the listening ear.

    24
    He brought it to her father's hall,
    And there was the court assembled all.

    25
    He laid this harp upon a stone,
    And straight it began to play alone.

    26
    'O yonder sits my father, the king,
    And yonder sits my mother, the queen.

    27
    'And yonder stands my brother Hugh,
    And by him my William, sweet and true.'

    28
    But the last tune that the harp playd then,
    Was 'Woe to my sister, false Helen!'

    He courted the youngest wi broach and ring,

        _Jamieson, Popular Ballads and Songs, I, 48, says that he
        gives his text verbatim as it was taken from the
        recitation of the lady in Fifeshire (Mrs Brown), to whom
        both he and Scott were so much indebted. That this is not
        to be understood with absolute strictness will appear from
        the variations which are subjoined. Jamieson adds that he
        had received another copy from Mrs Arrott of Aberbrothick,
        "~but as it furnished no readings by which the text could
        have been materially improved~," it was not used. Both
        Jamieson and Scott substitute the "~Binnorie~" burden,
        "~the most common and popular~," says Scott, for the one
        given by Mrs Brown, with which Mrs Arrott's agreed. It may
        be added that Jamieson's interpolations are stanzas 20,
        21, 27, etc., and not, as he says (I, 49), 19, 20, 27,
        etc. These interpolations also occur as such in the
        manuscript._

        _A copy in Motherwell's MS., p. 239, is derived from
        Jamieson's printed edition. It omits the interpolated
        stanzas, and makes a few very slight changes._

        _Scott's account of his edition is as follows (II, 143,
        later ed., III, 287)_:

        "It is compiled from a copy in Mrs Brown's MS., intermixed
        with a beautiful fragment, of fourteen verses, transmitted
        to the editor by J.C. Walker, Esq., the ingenious
        historian of the Irish bards. Mr Walker, at the same time,
        favored the editor with the following note: 'I am indebted
        to my departed friend, Miss Brooke, for the foregoing
        pathetic fragment. Her account of it was as follows: This
        song was transcribed, several years ago, from the memory
        of an old woman, who had no recollection of the concluding
        verses; probably the beginning may also be lost, as it
        seems to commence abruptly.' The first verse and burden of
        the fragment run thus:

          "'O sister, sister, reach thy hand!
            Hey ho, my Nanny, O
          And you shall be heir of all my land.
            While the swan swims bonny, O'"

        _Out of this stanza, or the corresponding one in Mrs
        Brown's copy, Scott seems to have made his 9, 10._

        _These fragments were communicated to Notes and Queries,
        April 3, 1852, by "~G. A. C.~," who had heard '~The
        Miller's Melody~' sung by an old lady in his childhood,
        and who represents himself as probably the last survivor
        of those who had enjoyed the privilege of listening to her
        ballads. We may, therefore, assign this version to the
        latter part of the 18th century. The two four-line stanzas
        were sung to "~a slow, quaint strain~." Two others which
        followed were not remembered, "~but their purport was that
        the body 'stopped hard by a miller's mill,' and that this
        'miller chanced to come by,' and took it out of the water
        'to make a melodye.'~" G.A.C. goes on to say_: "My
        venerable friend's tune here became a more lively one, and
        the time quicker; but I can only recollect a few of the
        couplets, and these not correctly nor in order of
        sequence, in which the transformation of the lady into a
        viol is described."

#b.#

        _Some stanzas of this four-line version, with a ludicrous
        modern supplement, are given in '~The Scouring of the
        White Horse~,' p. 161, as from the Welsh marshes. Five out
        of the first six verses are there said to be very old
        indeed, "~the rest all patchwork by different hands~." Mr
        Hughes has kindly informed me that he derived the ballad
        from his father, who had originally learned it at Ruthyn
        when a boy. What is material here follows_:

          1
          O it was not a pheasant cock,
            Nor yet a pheasant hen,
          But O it was a lady fair
            Came swimming down the stream.

          2
          An ancient harper passing by
            Found this poor lady's body,
          To which his pains he did apply
            To make a sweet mel['o]dy.

          3
          To cat-gut dried he her inside,
            He drew out her back-bone,
          And made thereof a fiddle sweet
            All for to play upon.

          4
          And all her hair, so long and fair,
            That down her back did flow,
          O he did lay it up with care,
            To string his fiddle bow.

          5
          And what did he with her fingers,
            Which were so straight and small?
          O he did cut them into pegs,
            To screw up his fiddoll.

          6
          Then forth went he, as it might be,
            Upon a summer's day,
          And met a goodly company,
            Who asked him in to play.

      |     7
      |     Then from her bones he drew such tones
      |       As made their bones to ache,
      |     They sounded so like human groans
      |       Their hearts began to quake.

      |     8
      |     They ordered him in ale to swim,--
      |       For sorrow's mighty dry,--
      |     And he to share their wassail fare
      |       Essayd right willingly.

          9
          He laid his fiddle on a shelf
            In that old manor-hall,
          It played and sung all by itself,
            And thus sung this fiddoll:

      |     10
      |     'There sits the squire, my worthy sire,
      |       A-drinking hisself drunk,' etc., etc.

        three fourths would have been a more exact apportionment.

[126] Campbell's Popular Tales of the West Highlands, IV, 126, 1862.

[127] Jamieson, in his Popular Ballads, II, 315, prints the ballad, with
five inconsiderable variations from the broadside, as from Musarum
Delici[ae], 2d edition, 1656. The careful reprint of this book, and of the
same edition, in "Faceti[ae]," etc., 1817, does not contain this piece, and
the first edition, of 1655, differed in no respect as to contents,
according to the editor of "Faceti[ae]." Still it is hardly credible that
Jamieson has blundered, and we may suppose that copies, ostensibly of
the same edition, varied as to contents, a thing common enough with old
books.

[128] Cunningham has re-written Scott's version, Songs of Scotland, II,
109, 'The Two Fair Sisters.' He says, "I was once deeply touched with
the singing of this romantic and mournful song.... I have ventured to
print it in the manner I heard it sung." There is, to be sure, no reason
why he should not have heard his own song sung, _once_, and still less
why he should not have been deeply touched with his own pathos.
Cunningham adds one genuine stanza, resembling the first of #G#, #J#,
#P#:

    Two fair sisters lived in a bower,
      Hey ho my nonnie O
    There came a knight to be their wooer.
      While the swan swims bonnie O

[129] English #M# is confused on this point. The sisters live in a hall.
The burden in st. 1 makes them love a miller-lad; but in 14, 15, calls
the drowned girl "the bonnie miller's-lass o Binorie."

[130] The sisters, #D#, #I#, walk by, up, a linn; #G#, go to a sand
[strand]; #Q#, go to the stream; #R a#, walk on the bryn.

[131] Swedish #H# begins, "Dear sister, come follow me to the
clapping-stone:" "Nay, I have no foul clothes." So #F# 6, 7, #G# 4, 5,
F[:a]r[:o]e #A# 6, nearly; and then follows the suggestion that they should
wash themselves. Another of Rancken's copies begins, "Two sisters went
to the bucking-stone, to buck their clothes snow-white," #H#; and so
Rancken's #S# nearly.

[132] There are, besides the two fishermen, in Norwegian #A#, two
"twaddere," i.e., landloupers, possibly (Bugge) a corruption of the word
rendered pilgrims, F[:a]r[:o]e vallarar, Swedish vallare. The vallarar in
these ballads are perhaps more respectable than those whose acquaintance
we shall make through the Norse versions of 'Babylon,' and may be
allowed to be harmless vagrants, but scarcely better, seeing that they
are ranked with "staff-carls" in Norges Gamle Love, cited by Cleasby and
Vigfusson at 'vallari.'

[133] A harp in the Icelandic and Norwegian ballads, F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#,
#C#, Swedish #A#, #B#, #D#, #G#, #H#; a harp in English #B#, #C#, #G#,
#J#. A harp is not named in any of the Danish versions, but a fiddle is
mentioned in #C#, #E#, #H#, is plainly meant in #A#, and may always be
intended; or perhaps _two_ fiddles in all but #H# (which has only one
fiddler), and the corrupted #G#. #D# begins with two fiddlers, but
concludes with only one. We have a fiddle in Swedish #C#, and in English
#A#, #D#, #E#, #F#, #I#, #J#, #K#, #L#, #O#, #P#; both harp and fiddle
in #H#.

[134] Some of the unprinted Norwegian ballads are not completely
described, but a departure from the rule of the major part would
probably have been alluded to.

[135] The stanza, 9, in which this is said is no doubt as to its form
entirely modern, but not so the idea. #I# has "the first spring that he
playd, _it_ said," etc.

[136] The fourth string is _said_ to speak in F[:a]r[:o]e #A# 30, but no
utterance is recorded, and this is likely to be a mistake. In many of
the versions, and in this, after the strings have spoken individually,
they unite in a powerful but inarticulate concord.

[137] #I# has lost the terminal stanzas.

[138] Not #M#, and apparently not #D#, which ends:

    When he kissed the harp upon the mouth, his heart broke.

[139] So the traitor John pushes away Catherine's hands in 'Lady Isabel
and the Elf Knight,' Polish #Q# 25 (see p. 40). In the French versions
#A#, #C#, #E# of the same, the knight catches at a branch to save
himself, and the lady cuts it off with his sword.

[140] The miller begins to lose character in #H#:

    14
    He dragged her out unto the shore,
    And stripped her of all she wore.

[141] Neus also refers to an Esthonian saga of R[:o]gutaja's wife, and to
'Die Pfeiferin,' a tale, in Das Inland, 1846, No 48, Beilage, col. 1246
ff, 1851, No 14, col. 230 ff; and to a Slovenian ballad in Tielemann,

#A a# was obtained directly from Mrs Brown of Falkland, in 1800, by
Alexander Fraser Tytler. Jamieson says that he gives #b# verbatim from
the recitation of Mrs Arrott; but it would seem that this must have been
a slip of memory, for the two agree except in half a dozen words. #B#,
#C#, #I#, #J# are now for the first time printed. #G# only was taken
down earlier than the present century.

Aytoun remarks (1858): "This is, perhaps, the most popular of all the
Scottish ballads, being commonly recited and sung even at the present
day." The copy which he gives, I, 232, was "taken down from recitation,"
but is nevertheless a compound of #G# and #A b#, with a few unimportant
variations, proceeding, no doubt, from imperfect recollection.[143] The
copy in Dixon's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs, p. 56, repeated in
Bell's volume of the same title, p. 50, is Gilbert's #F#. Dixon informs
us that the ballad was (in 1846) still popular amongst the peasantry in
the west of England. Cunningham gives us a piece called 'The Three
Ladies of Leithan Ha,' Songs of Scotland, II, 87, which he would fain
have us believe that he did not know he had written himself. "The common
copies of this tragic lyric," he truly says, "differ very much from
this; not so much in the story itself as in the way it is told."

All versions but #K#, which has pretty nearly lost all point, agree
after the opening stanzas. #A-E# have three ladies and only one knight;
#F# has three knights and one lady; #G#, #I#, #J#, #K# have three ladies
and three knights [lords in #G#, "bonny boys" in #I#, the first line
being caught from 'Sir Hugh.'] Three knights are to no purpose; only one
knight has anything to do. The reason for three ladies is, of course,
that the youngest may be preferred to the others,--an intention somewhat
obscured in #B#. The ladies are in colors in #B#, #C#, #I#, #J#, and
this seems to be the better interpretation in the case of #G#, though a
strict construction of the language would rather point to the other. The
colors are transferred to the knights in #F# because there is only one
lady. In #K# this is a part of the general depravation of the ballad.

'Rizzardo bello,' Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, No 83, seems to be the
same story, with a change of relations such as we often find in ballad
poetry. Rizzardo is conducting his bride home, and on the way embraces
and kisses her. Her brother witnesses "questo onore," and thrusts his
sword into the happy bridegroom's heart. Rizzardo tells his bride to
come on slowly; he will go before to make preparation. He begs his
mother to open the doors, for his bride is without, and he is wounded to
death. They try to make the bride eat. She says she can neither eat nor
drink: she must put her husband to bed. He gives her a ring, saying,
Your brother has been the death of me; then another ring, in sign that
she is to be wife of two brothers. She answers him as Guldborg answers
Ribold, that she would die rather: "Rather die between two knives than
be wife of two brothers." This ballad was obtained from a peasant woman
of Castagnero. Another version, which unfortunately is not printed, was
sung by a woman at Ostiglia on the Po.

Dr Prior remarks that the offence given by not asking a brother's assent
to his sister's marriage was in ballad-times regarded as unpardonable.
Other cases which show the importance of this preliminary, and the
sometimes fatal consequences of omitting it, are: 'Hr. Peder og
Mettelille,' Grundtvig, No 78, II, 325, sts 4, 6; 'Jomfruen i Skoven,'
Danske Viser, III, 99, st. 15; 'Jomfru Ellensborg og Hr. Olof,' ib.,
III, 316, st. 16; 'Iver Lang og hans S[/o]ster,' ib., IV, 87, st. 116;
'Herr Helmer Blaa,' ib., IV, 251, st. 8; 'Jomfru Giselmaar,' ib., IV,
309, st. 13. See Prior's Ancient Danish Ballads, III, 112, 232 f, 416.

There is a very common German ballad, 'Graf Friedrich,' in which a bride
receives a mortal wound during the bringing-home, but accidentally, and
from the bridegroom's hand. The marriage train is going up a hill; the
way is narrow; they are crowded; Graf Friedrich's sword shoots from its
sheath and wounds the bride. The bridegroom is exceedingly distressed;
he tries to stop the bleeding with his shirt; she begs that they may
ride slowly. When they reach the house there is a splendid feast, and
everything is set before the bride; but she can neither eat nor drink,
and only wishes to lie down. She dies in the night. Her father comes in
the morning, and, learning what has happened, runs Graf Friedrich
through, then drags his body at a horse's heels, and buries it in a bog.
Three lilies sprang from the spot, with an inscription announcing that
Graf Friedrich was in heaven, and a voice came from the sky commanding
that the body should be disinterred. The bridegroom was then buried with
his bride, and this act of reparation was attended with other miraculous
manifestations. As the ballads stand now, the kinship of 'Graf
Friedrich' with 'The Cruel Brother' is not close and cannot be insisted
on; still an early connection is not improbable.

The versions of 'Graf Friedrich' are somewhat numerous, and there is a
general agreement as to all essentials. They are: #A#, a Nuremberg
broadside "of about 1535," which has not been made accessible by a
reprint. #B#, a Swiss broadside of 1647, without place, "printed in
Seckendorf's Musenalmanach f[:u]r 1808, p. 19;" Uhland, No 122, p. 277;
Mittler, No 108; Wunderhorn, II, 293 (1857); Erk's Liederhort, No

p. 28, omitting four stanzas and with changes; as written down by
Goethe for Herder, D[:u]ntzer u. Herder, Briefe Goethes, u.s.w., Aus

A Danish ballad, 'Den saarede Jomfru,' Grundtvig, No 244, IV, 474,
has this slight resemblance with 'Graf Friedrich:' While a knight is
dancing with a princess, his sword glides from the scabbard and cuts
her hand. To save her partner from blame, she represents to her father
that she had cut herself with her brother's sword. This considerateness
so touches the knight (who is, of course, her equal in rank) that he
offers her his hand. The Danish story is found also in Norwegian and in
F[:a]r[:o]e ballads.

The peculiar testament made by the bride in 'The Cruel Brother,' by
which she bequeaths good things to her friends, but ill things to the
author of her death, is highly characteristic of ballad poetry. It will
be found again in 'Lord Ronald,' 'Edward,' and their analogues. Still
other ballads with this kind of testament are: 'Frillens H[ae]vn,'
Grundtvig, No 208 #C#, 16-18, IV, 207; a young man, stabbed by his
leman, whom he was about to give up in order to marry, leaves his lands
to his father, his bride-bed to his sister, his gilded couch to his
mother, and his knife to his leman, wishing it in her body. 'M[/o]en paa
Baalet,' Grundtvig, No 109 #A#, 1821, II, 587; Ole, falsely accused by
her brother, and condemned to be burned, gives her mother her silken
sark, her sister her shoes, her father her horse, and her brother her
knife, with the same wish. 'Kong Valdemar og hans S[/o]ster,' Grundtvig, No
126, III, 97, has a testament in #A-E# and #I#; in #I#, 14-19 (III,
912), Liden Kirsten bequeaths her knife, with the same imprecation, to
the queen, who, in the other copies, is her unrelenting foe: so Lillelin
to Herr Adelbrand, Danske Viser, III, 386, No 162, 16-18, Kristensen, I,
262, No 100, #A# 20-23, having been dragged at a horse's heels in
resentment of a taunt. 'Hustru og Mands Moder,' Grundtvig, No. 84, II,
404, has a testament in #A#, #B#, #D#, #H#, and in the last three a
bequest of shoes or sark to a cruel mother-in-law or foster-mother, with
the wish that she may have no peace or much pain in the wearing.
'Catarina de Li['o],' Briz y Candi, Cansons de la Terra, I, 209, has been
beaten by her mother-in-law while in a delicate state. When she is at
the point of death, the mother-in-law asks what doctor she will have and
what will she will make. "My will," says Catherine, "will not please you
much. Send back my velvet dress to my father's; my gala dress give my
sister; give my working dress to the maid, my jewels to the Virgin."
"And what will you leave to me?" "What I leave you will not please you
much: my husband to be hanged, my mother-in-law to be quartered, and my
sister-in-law to be burned." 'Le Testament de Marion,' another version
of this story from the south of France, Uchaud, Gard, Po['e]sies pop. de la
France, MS., IV, fol. 283, bequeaths "my laces to my sister Marioun, my
prettiest gowns to my sister Jeanneton; to my rascal of a husband three
fine cords, and, if that is not enough (to hang him), the hem of his
shirt." The Portuguese ballad of 'Dona Helena' rather implies than
expresses the imprecation: Braga, C.P. do Archipelago A[c,]oriano, p. 225,
No 15, p. 227, No 16; Almeida-Garrett, III, 56; Hartung, I, 233-43, No
18. Helena leaves her husband's house when near childbirth, out of fear
of his mother. Her husband, who does not know her reason, goes after
her, and compels her to return on horseback, though she has just borne a
son. The consequences are what might be expected, and Helena desires to
make her shrift and her will. She leaves one thing to her oldest sister,
another to her youngest. "And your boy?" "To your bitch of a mother,
cause of my woes." "Rather to yours," says the husband, "for I shall
have to kill mine" (so Braga; Garrett differs somewhat). 'Die Frau zur
Weissenburg' (#A#), Uhland, p. 287, No 123 #B#, Scherer's Jungbrunnen,
p. 94, No 29; 'Das Lied von der L[:o]wenburg' (#B#), Simrock, p. 65, No 27;
'Hans Steutlinger' (#C#), Wunderhorn, II, 168 (1857), all one story,
have a bitterly sarcastic testament. A lady instigates her paramour to
kill her husband. The betrayed man is asked to whom he will leave his
children [commit, #A#, bequeath, #B#, #C#]. "To God Almighty, for he
knows who they are." "Your property?" "To the poor, for the rich have
enough." "Your wife?" "To young Count Frederic, whom she always liked
more than me (#A#)." "Your castle?" "To the flames."

In some cases there is no trace of animosity towards the person who has
caused the testator's death; as in 'El testamento de Amelia' (who has
been poisoned by her mother), Mil['a], Observaciones, p. 103, No 5, Briz y
Salt['o], Cansons de la Terra, II, 197 (two copies); 'Herren B[oa]ld,'
Afzelius, I, 76, No 16 (new ed. I, 59, No 15); a Swedish form of
'Frillens H[ae]vn,' Grundtvig, IV, 203; 'Ren['e]e le Glaz' and 'Ervoanik Le
Lintier,' Luzel, C.P. de la Basse Bretagne, I, 405, 539, 553. There are
also simple testaments where there is no occasion for an ill
remembrance, as in 'Ribold og Guldborg,' Grundtvig, No 82, #I#, #K#,
#L#, #U#, #X#, #[AE]#, Kristensen, II, No 84 B; 'Pontplancoat;' Luzel, I,
383, 391. And, again, there are parodies of these wills. Thus the fox
makes his will: Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder, 1854, 'Mikkels
Arvegods,' p. 24, and p. 25 a copy from a manuscript three hundred years
old; Kristensen, Jyske Folkeviser, II, 324, No 90; 'Reven og Bj[:o]nnen,'
'Reven og Nils fiskar,' Landstad, Nos 85, 86, p. 637, 639: and the
robin, 'Robin's Tesment,' Buchan, I, 273, Herd's MSS, I, 154, and
Scottish Songs (1776), II, 166, Chambers' Popular Rhymes, p. 38, "new
edition."

        Popular Ballads, I, 66, purporting to be from the
        recitation of Mrs Arrot of Aberbrothick.

    1
    There was three ladies playd at the ba,
      With a hey ho and a lillie gay
    There came a knight and played oer them a'.
      As the primrose spreads so sweetly

    2
    The eldest was baith tall and fair,
    But the youngest was beyond compare.

    3
    The midmost had a graceful mien,
    But the youngest lookd like beautie's queen.

    4
    The knight bowd low to a' the three,
    But to the youngest he bent his knee.

    5
    The ladie turned her head aside,
    The knight he woo'd her to be his bride.

    6
    The ladie blushd a rosy red,
    And sayd, 'Sir knight, I'm too young to wed.'

    7
    'O ladie fair, give me your hand,
    And I'll make you ladie of a' my land.'

    8
    'Sir knight, ere ye my favor win,
    You maun get consent frae a' my kin.'

    9
    He's got consent frae her parents dear,
    And likewise frae her sisters fair.

    10
    He's got consent frae her kin each one,
    But forgot to spiek to her brother John.

    11
    Now, when the wedding day was come,
    The knight would take his bonny bride home.

    12
    And many a lord and many a knight
    Came to behold that ladie bright.

    13
    And there was nae man that did her see,
    But wishd himself bridegroom to be.

    14
    Her father dear led her down the stair,
    And her sisters twain they kissd her there.

    15
    Her mother dear led her thro the closs,
    And her brother John set her on her horse.

    16
    She leand her oer the saddle-bow,
    To give him a kiss ere she did go.

    17
    He has taen a knife, baith lang and sharp,
    And stabbd that bonny bride to the heart.

    18
    She hadno ridden half thro the town,
    Until her heart's blude staind her gown.

    19
    'Ride softly on,' says the best young man,
    'For I think our bonny bride looks pale and wan.'

    20
    'O lead me gently up yon hill,
    And I'll there sit down, and make my will.'

    21
    'O what will you leave to your father dear?'
    'The silver-shod steed that brought me here.'

    22
    'What will you leave to your mother dear?'
    'My velvet pall and my silken gear.'

    23
    'What will you leave to your sister Anne?'
    'My silken scarf and my gowden fan.'

    24
    'What will you leave to your sister Grace?'
    'My bloody cloaths to wash and dress.'

    25
    'What will you leave to your brother John?'
    'The gallows-tree to hang him on.'

    26
    'What will you leave to your brother John's wife?'

    27
    This ladie fair in her grave was laid,
    And many a mass was oer her said.

    28
    But it would have made your heart right sair,
    To see the bridegroom rive his haire.

    1
    A gentleman cam oure the sea,
      Fine flowers in the valley
    And he has courted ladies three.
      With the light green and the yellow

    2
    One o them was clad in red:
    He asked if she wad be his bride.

    3
    One o them was clad in green:
    He asked if she wad be his queen.

    The last o them was clad in white:
    He asked if she wad be his heart's delight.

    5
    'Ye may ga ask my father, the king:
    Sae maun ye ask my mither, the queen.

    6
    'Sae maun ye ask my sister Anne:
    And dinna forget my brither John.'

    7
    He has asked her father, the king:
    And sae did he her mither, the queen.

    8
    And he has asked her sister Anne:
    But he has forgot her brother John.

    9
    Her father led her through the ha,
    Her mither danced afore them a'.

    10
    Her sister Anne led her through the closs,
    Her brither John set her on her horse.

    11
    It's then he drew a little penknife,
    And he reft the fair maid o her life.

    12
    'Ride up, ride up,' said the foremost man;
    'I think our bride comes hooly on.'

    13
    'Ride up, ride up,' said the second man;
    'I think our bride looks pale and wan.'

    Up than cam the gay bridegroom,

    'Then have you asked of my father dear,

The title 'Lord Randal' is selected for this ballad because that name
occurs in one of the better versions, and because it has become familiar
through Scott's Minstrelsy. Scott says that the hero was more generally
termed Lord Ronald: but in the versions that have come down to us this
is not so. None of these can be traced back further than a century. #F#
and #D# were the earliest published. Jamieson remarks with respect to
#G# (1814): "An English gentleman, who had never paid any attention to
ballads, nor ever read a collection of such things, told me that when a
child he learnt from a playmate of his own age, the daughter of a
clergyman in Suffolk, the following imperfect ditty." #I#, a version
current in eastern Massachusetts, may be carried as far back as any.
#a#, #b# derive from Elizabeth Foster, whose parents, both natives of
eastern Massachusetts, settled, after their marriage, in Maine, where
she was born in 1789. Elizabeth Foster's mother is remembered to have
sung the ballad, and I am informed that the daughter must have learned
it not long after 1789, since she was removed in her childhood from
Maine to Massachusetts, and continued there till her death. 'Tiranti'
['Taranti'] may not improbably be a corruption of Lord Randal.

The copy in Smith's Scottish Minstrel, III, 58, is Scott's altered. The
first four stanzas are from the Border Minstrelsy, except the last line
of the fourth, which is from Johnson's Museum. The last two stanzas are
a poor modern invention.

Three stanzas which are found in #A#. Cunningham's Scottish Songs, I,
286 f, may be given for what they are worth. 'The house of Marr,' in the
first, is not to be accepted on the simple ground of its appearance in
his pages. The second is inserted in his beautified edition of Scott's
ballad, and has its burden accordingly; but there is, besides this, no
internal evidence against the second, and none against the third.

    'O where have you been, Lord Ronald, my son?
    O where have you been, my handsome young man?'
    'At the house of Marr, mother, so make my bed soon,
    For I'm wearied with hunting, and fain would lie down.'

    'O where did she find them, Lord Randal, my son?
    O where did she catch them, my handsome young man?'
    'Neath the bush of brown bracken, so make my bed soon,
    For I'm wae and I'm weary, and fain would lie down.'

    'O what got your bloodhounds, Lord Ronald, my son?
    O what got your bloodhounds, my handsome young man?'
    'They lapt the broo, mother, so make my bed soon,
    I am wearied with hunting, and fain would lie down.'

A pot-pourri or quodlibet, reprinted in Wolff's Egeria, p. 53, from a
Veronese broadside of the date 1629, shows that this ballad was popular
in #Italy# more than 250 years ago; for the last but one of the
fragments which make up the medley happens to be the first three lines
of 'L'Avvelenato,' very nearly as they are sung at the present day, and
these are introduced by a summary of the story:

    "Io vo' finire con questa _d'un amante
    Tradito dall' amata._
    Oh che l'[e'] s[i'] garbata
    A cantarla in ischiera:
    _'Dov' andastu iersera,
    Figliuol mio ricco, savio e gentile?
    Dov' andastu iersera'?_"[144]

The ballad was first recovered in 1865, by Dr G. B. Bolza, who took it
down from the singing of very young girls at Loveno. Since then good
copies have been found at Venice. #A#, 'L'Avvelenato,' Bolza, Canzoni
popolari comasche, No 49, Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy
(philos. histor. class), LIII, 668, is of seventeen stanzas, of seven
short lines, all of which repeat but two: the 8th and 10th stanzas are
imperfect.[145] A mother inquires of her son where he has been. He has
been at his mistress's, where he has eaten part of an eel; the rest was
given to a dog, that died in the street. The mother declares that he has
been poisoned. He bids her send for the doctor to see him, for the
curate to shrive him, for the notary to make his will. He leaves his
mother his palace, his brothers his carriage and horses, his sisters a
dowry, his servants a free passage to mass ("la strada d'and[a'] a messa" #
nothing), a hundred and fifty masses for his soul; for his mistress the
gallows to hang her. #B#, #C#, 'L'Avvelenato,' Bernoni, Nuovi Canti
popolari veneziani, 1874, No 1, p. 5, p. 3, have twelve and eighteen
four-line stanzas, the questions and answers in successive stanzas, and
the last three lines of the first pair repeated respectively
throughout.[146] #B#, which is given as a variant of #C#, agrees with
#A# as to the agent in the young man's death. It is his mistress in #B#,
but in #C# it is his mother. In both, as in #A#, he has eaten of an eel.
The head he gave to the dogs, the tail to the cats (#C#). He leaves to
his stewards (castaldi) his carriages and horses (#C#); to his herdsmen
his cows and fields; to the maids his chamber furnishings; to his sister
the bare privilege of going to mass (#C#, as in #A#); to his mother
[wife, #C#] the keys of his treasure. "La forca per picarla" is in #B#
as in #A# the bequest to his false love, instead of whom we have his
mother in #C#.

The corresponding #German# ballad has been known to the English for two
generations through Jamieson's translation. The several versions, all
from oral tradition of this century, show the same resemblances and
differences as the English.

#A#, #B#, 'Schlangenk[:o]chin,' eight stanzas of six lines, four of
which are burden, #A#, Liederhort, p. 6, No 2^a, from the neighborhood
of Wilsnack, Brandenburg, #B#, Peter, I, 187, No 6, from Weidenau,
Austrian Silesia, run thus: Henry tells his mother that he has been
at his sweetheart's (but not a-hunting); has had a speckled fish to
eat, part of which was given to the dog [cat, #B#], which burst. Henry
wishes his father and mother all blessings, and hell-pains to his
love, #A# 6-8. His mother, #B# 8, asks where she shall make his bed:
he replies, In the church-yard. #C#, 'Grossmutter Schlangenk[:o]chin,'
first published in 1802, in Maria's (Clemens Brentano's) romance Godwi,
II, 113, afterward in the Wunderhorn, I, 19 (ed. 1819, I, 20, ed.
1857), has fourteen two-line stanzas, or seven of four lines, one half
burden. The copy in Zuccalmaglio, p. 217, No 104, "from Hesse and North
Germany," is the same thing with another line of burden intercalated
and two or three slight changes. Maria has been at her grandmother's,
who gave her a fish to eat which she had caught in her kitchen garden;
the dog ate the leavings, and his belly burst. The conclusion agrees
with #B#, neither having the testament. #D#, 'Stiefmutter,' seven
stanzas of four short lines, two being burden, Uhland, No 120, p. 272;
excepting one slight variation, the same as Liederhort, p. 5, No 2,
from the vicinity of B[:u]ckeburg, Lippe-Schaumburg. A child has been
at her mother's sister's house, where she has had a well-peppered
broth and a glass of red wine. The dogs [and cats] had some broth too,
and died on the spot. The child wishes its father a seat in heaven,
for its mother one in hell. #E#, 'Kind, wo bist du denn henne west?'
Reiffenberg, p. 8, No 4, from B[:o]kendorf, Westphalia, four stanzas
of six lines, combining question and answer, two of the six burden.
A child has been at its step-aunt's, and has had a bit of a fish
caught in the nettles along the wall. The child gives all its goods
to its brother, its clothes to its sister, but three devils to its
[step-]mother. #F#, 'Das vergiftete kind,' seven four-line stanzas, two
burden, Schuster, Siebenb[:u]rgisch-s[:a]chsische V. L., p. 62, No 58,
from M[:u]hlbach. A child tells its father that its heart is bursting;
it has eaten of a fish, given it by its mother, which the father
declares to be an adder. The child wishes its father a seat in heaven,
its mother one in hell.

#A#, #B# are nearer to 'Lord Randal,' and have even the name Henry which
we find in English #C#. #C-F# are like #J-O#, 'The Croodlin Doo.'

#Dutch.# 'Isabelle,' Snellaert, p. 73, No 67, seven four-line stanzas,
the first and fourth lines repeated in each. Isabel has been sewing at
her aunt's, and has eaten of a fish with yellow stripes that had been
caught with tongs in the cellar. The broth, poured into the street,
caused the dogs to burst. She wishes her aunt a red-hot furnace, herself
a spade to bury her, her brother a wife like his mother.

#Swedish.# #A#, 'Den lillas Testamente,' ten five-line stanzas, three
lines burden, Afzelius, III, 13, No 68; ed. Bergstr[:o]m, I, 291, No 55. A
girl, interrogated by her step-mother, says she has been at her aunt's,
and has eaten two wee striped fishes. The bones she gave the dog; the
stanza which should describe the effect is wanting. She wishes heaven
for her father and mother, a ship for her brother, a jewel-box and
chests for her sister, and hell for her step-mother and her nurse. #B#,
Arwidsson, II, 90, No 88, nine five-line stanzas, two lines burden. In
the first stanza, evidently corrupt, the girl says she has been at her
brother's. She has had eels cooked with pepper, and the bones, given to
the dogs, made them burst. She gives her father good corn in his barns,
her brother and sister a ship, etc., hell to her step-mother and nurse.

#Danish.# Communicated by Prof. Grundtvig, as obtained for the first
time from tradition in 1877; five stanzas of five lines, three lines
repeating. Elselille, in answer to her mother, says she has been in the
meadow, where she got twelve small snakes. She wishes heavenly joy to
her father, a grave to her brother, hell torment to her sister.

#Magyar.# 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Aigner, Ungarische Volksdichtungen,
2^e Auflage, p. 127, in nine six-line stanzas, four being a burden.
Johnnie, in answer to his mother, says he has been at his
sister-in-law's, and has eaten a speckled toad, served on her handsomest
plate, of which he is dying. He bequeaths to his father his best
carriage, to his brothers his finest horses, to his sister his house
furniture, to his sister-in-law everlasting damnation, to his mother
pain and sorrow.

#Wendish.# 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Haupt u. Schmaler, I, 110, No 77,
twelve four-line stanzas, combining question and answer, the first and
last line repeating. Henry has been at the neighbor's, has eaten part of
a fish caught in the stable with a dung-fork; his dog ate the rest, and
burst. There is no testament. His mother asks him where she shall make
his bed; he replies, In the churchyard; turn my head westward, and cover
me with green turf.

The numerous forms of this story show a general agreement, with but
little difference except as to the persons who are the object and the
agent of the crime. These are, according to the Italian
tradition,--which is 250 years old, while no other goes back more than a
hundred years, and far the larger part have been obtained in recent
years,--a young man and his true-love; and in this account unite two of
the three modern Italian versions, English #A-G#, German #A#, #B#. Scott
suggests that the handsome young sportsman (whom we find in English #A#,
#C#, #D#, #E#, #F#, #H#) may have been exchanged for a little child
poisoned by a step-mother, to excite greater interest in the nursery.
This seems very reasonable. What girl with a lover, singing the ballad,
would not be tempted to put off the treacherous act on so popular,
though most unjustly popular, an object of aversion? A mother, again,
would scarcely allow "mother" to stand, as is the case in Italian #C#
and German #F#, and a singer who considered that all blood relations
should be treated as sacred would ascribe the wickedness to somebody
beyond that pale, say a neighbor, as the Wendish ballad does, and
Zuccalmaglio's reading of German #C#. The step-mother is expressly named
only in English #J#, #K c#, #L#, #M#, #N#, #O#, and in four of these,
#J#, #K c#, #M#, #O#, the child has a mammie,[147] which certainly
proves an _alibi_ for the step-mother, and confirms what Scott says.
There is a step-aunt in German #E# and Swedish #A#, and the aunt in
German #D# and the Dutch ballad, and the grandmother in English #I#, #K
a#, #b#, German #C#, are perhaps meant (as the brother in Swedish #B#
certainly is) to be step-relations and accommodating instruments.

The poisoning is shifted to a wife in English #H#, to an uncle in
English #I d#, and to a sister-in-law in the Magyar version.

There is all but universal consent that the poisoning was done by
serving up snakes for fish. The Magyar says a toad, English #M# a
four-footed fish,[148] German #D# a well-peppered broth and a glass of
red wine. English #L# adds a drink of hemlock stocks to the speckled
trout; #F#, #H# have simply poison. The fish are distinctively eels in
the Italian versions, and in English #A#, #D#, #E#, #G#, #I#, Swedish
#B#. English #A#, #J#, #K#, #M#, #N#, #O#, German #A-D#, the Italian,
Swedish, Dutch, Wendish versions, and by implication English #C#, #D#,
#E# also, concur in saying that a part of the fish was given to a dog
[dogs, cat, cats], and that death was the consequence. Bursting or
swelling is characteristic of this kind of poisoning: German #A#, #B#,
#C#, #F#, English #D#, #E#, and the Dutch and Wendish versions.

The dying youth or child in many cases makes a nuncupative will, or
declares his last wishes, upon a suggestion proceeding from the person
who is by him, commonly from the mother: English #A#, #B#, #C#, #H#,
#I#: German #A#, #D#, #E#, #F#: the Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish,
Magyar versions. The bequest to the poisoner is the gallows in English
#B#, #C#, #H#, #I#, Italian #A#, #B#, #C#; hell, English #A#, German
#A#, #D#, #F#, Swedish #A#, #B#, Danish; and an equivalent in German
#E#, the Dutch and the Magyar copy. 'The Cruel Brother,' No 11, and
'Edward,' No 13, have a will of this same fashion.

In all the English versions the burden has the entreaty "Make my bed,"
and this is addressed to the mother in all but #L#, #N#. In #H#, an
Irish copy, and #I#, an American one, the mother asks where the bed
shall be made; and the answer is, In the churchyard. This feature is
found again in German #B#, #C# and in the Wendish version.

The resemblance in the form of the stanza in all the versions deserves a
word of remark. For the most part, the narrative proceeds in sections of
two short lines, or rather half lines, which are a question and an
answer, the rest of the stanza being regularly repeated. English #L#,
#N#, as written (#L# not always), separate the question and answer; this
is done, too, in Italian #B#, #C#. German #E#, on the contrary, has two
questions and the answers in each stanza, and is altogether peculiar.
Swedish #B# varies the burden in part, imagining father, brother,
sister, etc., to ask what the little girl will give to each, and
adapting the reply accordingly, "Faderen min," "Broderen min."

A Bohemian and a Catalan ballad which have two of the three principal
traits of the foregoing, the poisoning and the testament, do not
exhibit, perhaps have lost, the third, the employment of snakes.

The story of the first is that a mother who dislikes the wife her son
has chosen attempts to poison her at the wedding feast. She sets a glass
of honey before the son, a glass of poison before the bride. They
exchange cups. The poison is swift. The young man leaves four horses to
his brother, eight cows to his sister, his fine house to his wife. "And
what to me, my son?" asks the mother. A broad mill-stone and the deep
Moldau is the bequest to her. Waldau, B[:o]hmische Granaten, II, 109, cited
by Reifferscheid, p. 137 f.

The Catalan ballad seems to have been softened at the end. Here again a
mother hates her daughter-in-law. She comes to the sick woman, "com qui
no 'n sab[e']s res," and asks What is the matter? The daughter says,
You have poisoned me. The mother exhorts her to confess and receive
the sacrament, and then make her will. She gives her castles in France
to the poor and the pilgrims [and the friars], and to her brother
Don Carlos [who, in one version is her husband]. Two of the versions
remember the Virgin. "And to me?" "To you, my husband [my cloak,
rosary], that when you go to mass you may remember me." In one version
the mother asks the dying woman where she will be buried. She says At
Saint Mary's. Mil[a'], Observaciones, p. 103 f, No 5, two versions:
Briz y Salt['o], II, 197 f, two also, the first nearly the same as
Mil[a']'s first.

Poisoning by giving a snake as food, or by infusing the venom in drink,
is an incident in several other popular ballads.

Donna Lombarda attempts, at the instigation of a lover, to rid herself
of her husband by pounding a serpent, or its head, in a mortar, and
mixing the juice with his wine [in one version simply killing the snake
and putting it in a cask]: Nigra, Canzoni del Piemonti, in Rivista
Contemporanea, XII, 32 ff, four versions; Marcoaldi, p. 177, No 20;
Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, p. 46, No 72; Righi, Canti popolari
veronesi, p. 37, No 100*; Ferraro, C. p. monferrini, p. 1, No 1;
Bernoni, C. p. veneziani, Puntata V, No 1. In three of Nigra's versions
and in Ferraro's the drink is offered when the husband returns from
hunting. The husband, rendered suspicious by the look of the wine, or
warned of his danger, forces his wife to drink first. So in a northern
ballad, a mother who attempts to destroy her sons [step-sons] with a
brewage of this description is obliged to drink first, and bursts with
the poison: 'Eiturbyrlunar kv[ae][dh]i,' ['I]slenzk Fornkv., II, 79,
No 43 A; 'Fru Gundela,' Arwidsson, II, 92, No 89; 'Signelill aa hennes
synir,' Bugge, p. 95, No XX, the last half.

In one of the commonest Slavic ballads, a girl, who finds her brother
an obstacle to her desires, poisons him, at the instigation and under
the instruction of the man she fancies, or of her own motion, by giving
him a snake to eat, or the virus in drink. The object of her passion,
on being informed of what she has done, casts her off, for fear of her
doing the like to him. Bohemian: 'Sestra travi[vc]ka,' Erben, P. n.
w [vC]ech['a]ch, 1842, I, 9, No 2, Proston['a]rodni [vc]esk['e] P.,
1864, p. 477, No 13; Swoboda, Sb['i]rka [vc]. n. P., p. 19; German

108. Etc. The attempt is made, but unsuccessfully, in Sacharof, P.
russkago N., IV, 7.

A version given by De Rada, Rapsodie d'un poema albanese, p. 78, canto
x, resembles the Slavic, with a touch of the Italian. A man incites a
girl to poison her brother by pounding the poison out of a serpent's
head and tail and mixing it with wine.

In a widely spread Romaic ballad, a mother poisons the bride whom
her son has just brought home,--an orphan girl in some versions, but
in one a king's daughter wedding a king's son. The cooks who are
preparing the feast are made to cook for the bride the heads of three
snakes [nine snakes' heads, a three-headed snake, winged snakes and
two-headed adders]. In two Epirote versions the poisoned girl bursts
with the effects. "[Gk: Ta kaka petherika]," Passow, p. 335, No 456,
nearly==Zambelios, p. 753, No 41; Passow, p. 337, No 457; Tommaseo,
Canti popolari, III, 135; Jeannaraki, p. 127, No 130[149]; Chasiotis
(Epirote), p. 51, No 40, "[Gk: H[^e] bourgaropoula kai h[^e] kak[^e]
pethera;]" p. 103, No 22, "[Gk: Ho Dionys kai h[^e] kak[^e] pethera]."
(Liebrecht, Volkskunde, p. 214.)

An Italian mother-in-law undertakes to poison her son's wife with a
snake-potion. The wife, on her husband's return from the chase,
innocently proposes to share the drink with him. Her husband no sooner
has tasted than he falls dead. (Kaden, Italien's Wunderhorn, p. 85).

Scott cites in his preface to 'Lord Randal' a passage from a MS.
chronicle of England, in which the death of King John is described as
being brought about by administering to him the venom of a toad (cf. the
Magyar ballad). The symptoms--swelling and rupture--are found in the
Scandinavian and Epirote ballads referred to above, besides those
previously noticed (p. 155). King John had asked a monk at the abbey of
Swinshed how much a loaf on the table was worth. The monk answered a
half-penny. The king said that if he could bring it about, such a loaf
should be worth twenty pence ere half a year. The monk thought he would
rather die than that this should come to pass. "And anon the monk went
unto his abbot and was shrived of him, and told the abbot all that the
king said, and prayed his abbot to assoil him, for he would give the
king such a wassail that all England should be glad and joyful thereof.
Then went the monk into a garden, and found a toad therein, and took her
up, and put her in a cup, and filled it with good ale, and pricked her
in every place, in the cup, till the venom came out in every place, and
brought it before the king, and kneeled, and said: 'Sir, wassail: for
never in your life drank ye of such a cup.' 'Begin, monk,' said the
king: and the monk drank a great draught, and took the king the cup, and
the king also drank a great draught, and set down the cup. The monk anon
went to the firmary, and there died anon, on whose soul God have mercy,
amen. And five monks sing for his soul especially, and shall while the
abbey standeth. The king was anon full evil at ease, and commanded to
remove the table, and asked after the monk; and men told him that he was
dead, for his womb was broke in sunder. When the king heard this tiding,
he commanded for to truss: but all it was for nought, for his belly
began to swell from the drink that he drank, that he died within two
days, the morrow after Saint Luke's day." Minstrelsy, III, 287 f. The
same story in Eulogium Historiarum, ed. Haydon, III, 109 f.

EDWARD

        Minstrelsy, p. 339. From recitation.

        #B.# Percy's Reliques, 1765, I, 53. Communicated by Sir
        David Dalrymple.

        #C.# MS. of A. Laing, one stanza.


#A b#, "given from the recitation of an old woman," is evidently #A a#
slightly regulated by Motherwell. #B#, we are informed in the 4th
edition of the Reliques, p. 61, was sent Percy by Sir David Dalrymple,
Lord Hailes. Motherwell thought there was reason to believe "that his
lordship made a few slight verbal improvements on the copy he
transmitted, and altered the hero's name to Edward,--a name which, by
the bye, never occurs in a Scottish ballad, except where allusion is
made to an English king."[150] Dalrymple, at least, would not be likely
to change a Scotch for an English name. The Bishop might doubtless
prefer Edward to Wat, or Jock, or even Davie. But as there is no
evidence that any change of name was made, the point need not be
discussed. As for other changes, the word "brand," in the first stanza,
is possibly more literary than popular; further than this the language
is entirely fit. The affectedly antique spelling[151] in Percy's copy
has given rise to vague suspicions concerning the authenticity of the
ballad, or of the language: but as spelling will not make an old ballad,
so it will not unmake one. We have, but do not need, the later
traditional copy to prove the other genuine. 'Edward' is not only
unimpeachable, but has ever been regarded as one of the noblest and most
sterling specimens of the popular ballad.

Motherwell seems to incline to regard 'Edward' rather as a detached
portion of a ballad than as complete in itself. "The verses of which it
consists," he says, "generally conclude the ballad of 'The Twa
Brothers,' and also some versions of 'Lizie Wan:'" Minstrelsy, LXVII,
12. The Finnish parallel which Motherwell refers to, might have
convinced him that the ballad is complete as it is; and he knew as well
as anybody that one ballad is often appended to another by reciters, to
lengthen the story or improve the conclusion.[152] More or less of
'Edward' will be found in four versions of 'The Twa Brothers' and two of
'Lizie Wan,' further on in this volume.

This ballad has been familiarly known to have an exact counterpart in
#Swedish#. There are four versions, differing only as to length: 'Sven i
Roseng[oa]rd,' #A#, Afzelius, No 67, III, 4, eleven two-line stanzas, with
three more lines of burden; #B#, III, 3, six stanzas (Bergstr[:o]m's ed.,
No 54, 1, 2); #C#, Arwidsson, No 87 #A#, II, 83, eighteen stanzas; #D#,
No 87 B, II, 86, sixteen stanzas. The same in #Danish#: #A#, Grundtvig,
Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p. 175, nine stanzas; #B#, Boisen, Nye
og gamle Viser, 10th ed., No 95, p. 185, 'Brodermordet.' And in
#Finnish#, probably derived from the Swedish, but with traits of its
own: #A#, Schr[:o]ter's Finnische Runen, p. 124, 'Werinen Pojka,' The
Bloodstained Son, fifteen two-line stanzas, with two lines of refrain;
#B#, 'Velisurmaaja,' Brother-Murderer, Kanteletar, p. x, twenty stanzas.

All these are a dialogue between mother and son, with a question and
answer in each stanza. The mother asks, Where have you been? The son
replies that he has been in the stable [Danish, grove, fields; Finnish
#A#, on the sea-strand]. "How is it that your foot is bloody?"[153]
[clothes, shirt; Finnish, "How came your jerkin muddy?" etc.] A horse
has kicked or trod on him. "How came your sword so bloody?" He then
confesses that he has killed his brother. [Swedish #D# and the Danish
copies have no question about the foot, etc.] Then follows a series of
questions as to what the son will do with himself, and what shall become
of his wife, children, etc., which are answered much as in the English
ballad. Finally, in all, the mother asks when he will come back, and he
replies (with some variations), When crows are white. And that will be?
When swans are black. And that? When stones float. And that? When
feathers sink, etc. This last feature, stupidly exaggerated in some
copies, and even approaching burlesque, is one of the commonplaces of
ballad poetry, and may or may not have been, from the beginning, a part
of the ballads in which it occurs. Such a conclusion could not be made
to adhere to 'Edward,' the last stanza of which is peculiar in
implicating the mother in the guilt of the murder. Several versions of
'The Twa Brothers' preserve this trait, and 'Lizie Wan' also.

The stanza of this ballad was originally, in all probability, one of two
lines--a question and an answer--with refrains, as we find it in #A# 10,
11, 12, and the corresponding Swedish and Finnish ballad; and in 'Lord
Randal,' #J#, #K#, etc., and also the corresponding Swedish and German
ballad. #A# 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 are now essentially stanzas of one line,
with refrains; that is, the story advances in these at that rate. #A# 4,
7 (==#C#) are entirely irregular, substituting narrative or descriptive
circumstances for the last line of the refrain, and so far forth
departing from primitive simplicity.[154] The stanza in #B# embraces
always a question and a reply, but for what is refrain in other forms of
the ballad we have epical matter in many cases. #A# 1, 2,

[150] An eager "Englishman" might turn Motherwell's objection to the
name into an argument for 'Edward' being an "English" ballad.

[151] That is to say, initial _quh_ and _z_ for modern _wh_ and _y_, for
nothing else would have excited attention. Perhaps a transcriber thought
he ought to give the language a look at least as old as Gavin Douglas,
who spells _quhy_, _dois_, _[gh]our_. The _quh_ would serve a purpose,
if understood as indicating that the aspirate was not to be dropped, as
it often is in English _why_. The _z_ is the successor of [gh], and was
meant to be pronounced _y_, as _z_ is, or was, pronounced in
_gaberlunzie_ and other Scottish words. See Dr J. A. H. Murray's Dialect
of the Southern Counties of Scotland, pp. 118, 129. Since _quh_ and _z_
serve rather as rocks of offence than landmarks, I have thought it best
to use _wh_ and _y_.

[152] Motherwell also speaks of a ballad of the same nature as quoted in
Werner's 'Twenty-Fourth of February.' The stanza cited (in Act I, Scene
1) seems to be Herder's translation of 'Edward' given from memory.

[153] We have a similar passage in most of the copies of the third class
of the German ballads corresponding to No 4. A brother asks the man who
has killed his sister why his shoes [sword, hands] are bloody. See p.
36, p. 38. So in 'Herr Axel,' Arwidsson, No 46, I, 308.

[154] These have perhaps been adapted to the stanza of 'The Twa
Brothers,' with some versions of which, as already remarked, the present
ballad is blended.

[155] With regard to translations, I may say now, what I might well have
said earlier, that I do not aim at making a complete list, but give such
as have fallen under my notice.

#B a# is from tradition of the latter half of the eighteenth century;
the other copies from the earlier part of this.

Three sisters go out (together, #A#, #B#, #C#, successively, #D#, #E#)
to gather flowers (#A#, #B#, #E#). A banished man (outlyer bold, #D#,
Loudon lord, #E#) starts up from a hiding-place, and offers them one
after the other the choice of being his wife or dying by his hand.

    (#A.#)
    'It's whether will ye be a rank robber's wife,
    Or will ye die by my wee penknife?'

    (#D.#)
    'Wiltow twinn with thy maidenhead, or thy sweet life?'

The first and the second express a simple preference for death, and are
killed and laid by, "to bear the red rose company" (#A#). The youngest,
in #A#, says she has a brother in the wood, who will kill him if he
kills her. The outlaw asks the brother's name, finds that he himself is
the man, and takes his own life with the same weapon that had shed the
blood of his sisters. #B#, #C#, #D# have three brothers, the youngest of
whom is the banished lord (#C#), the outlyer bold (#D#). The story is
defective in #B#, #C#. In #D# the outlaw, on finding what he has done,
takes a long race, and falls on his knife. The conclusion of #E# is not
so finely tragic. A brother John comes riding by just as the robber is
about to kill the third sister, apprehends him by the agency of his
three pages, and reserves him to be hanged on a tree,

    Or thrown into the poisond lake,
    To feed the toads and rattle-snake.

According to the account given by Herd, and repeated by Jamieson, the
story of the lost conclusion of #B# made the banished man discover that
he had killed his two brothers as well as his two sisters.

This ballad, with additional circumstances, is familiar to all branches
of the Scandinavian race.

#Danish.# There are many versions from oral tradition, as yet
unprinted, besides these two: #A#, 'Hr. Truels's D[/o]ttre,' Danske
Viser, III, 392, No 164, there reprinted from Sandvig, Beskrivelse over
[/O]en M[/o]en, 1776: #B#, 'Herr Thors B[/o]rn,' from recent tradition
of North Sleswig, Berggreen, Danske Folke-Sange, 3d ed., p. 88, No 42.

#A.# Herr Truels' three daughters oversleep their matins one morning,
and are roused by their mother. If we have overslept our matins, they
say, we will make up at high mass. They set out for church, and in a
wood fall in with three robbers, who say:

    'Whether will ye be three robbers' wives,
    Or will ye rather lose your lives?'

Much rather death, say they. The two elder sisters submitted to their
fate without a word; the third made a hard resistance. With her last
breath she adjured the robbers to seek a lodging at Herr Truels' that
night. This they did. They drank so long that they drank Herr Truels to
bed. Then they asked his wife to promise herself to all three. First,
she said, she must look into their bags. In their bags she saw her
daughters' trinkets. She excused herself for a moment, barred the door
strongly, roused her husband, and made it known to him that these guests
had killed his three daughters. Herr Truels called on all his men to
arm. He asked the robbers who was their father. They said that they had
been stolen by robbers, on their way to school, one day; had had a hard
life for fourteen years; and the first crime they had committed was
killing three maids yesterday. Herr Truels revealed to them that they
had murdered their sisters, and offered them new clothes, in which they
might go away. "Nay," they said, "not so; life for life is meet." They
were taken out of the town, and their heads struck off. #B# differs from
#A# in only a few points. The robbers ask lodging at Herr Thor's, as
being pilgrims. When he discovers their true character, he threatens
them with the wheel. They say, Shall we come to the wheel? Our father
drinks Yule with the king. They tell him their story, and their father
offers them saddle and horse to make their best way off. They reply, "We
will give blood for blood," spread their cloaks on the floor, and let
their blood run.

#A.# Herr T[:o]res' daughters overslept matins, dressed themselves
handsomely, and set off for mass. All on the heath they were met by
three wood-robbers, who demanded, Will ye be our wives, or lose your
lives? The first answered: God save us from trying either! the second,
Rather let us range the world! the third, Better death with honor! But

    First were they the three wood-robbers' wives,
    And after that they lost their young lives.

The robbers strip them; then go and ask to be taken in by Herr T[:o]res. He
serves them with mead and wine, but presently begins to wish his
daughters were at home. His wife sees him to bed; then returns to her
guests, who offer her a silken sark to pass the night with them. "Give
me a sight of the silken sark," she cries, with prophetic soul: "God
have mercy on my daughters!" She rouses her husband, and tells him that
the robbers have slain his bairns. He puts on his armor and kills two of
them: the third begs to be spared till he can say who were his kin; his
father's name is T[:o]res! Father and mother resolve to build a church for
penance, and it shall be called Kerna. #B#, #C#, #D#. The girls meet
three "vallare," strolling men, and none of them good (#C#). The robbers
cut off the girls' heads on the trunk of a birch (cf. English #C# 5:
"It's lean your head upon my staff," and with his pen-knife he has
cutted it aff): three springs burst forth immediately. They go to the
house, and ask the mother if she will buy silken sarks that nine maids
have stitched (#B#). She says:

    'Open your sacks, and let me see:
    Mayhap I shall know them all three.'

The father, in #B#, when he discovers that he has slain his own sons,
goes to the smith, and has an iron band fastened round his middle. The
parents vow to build a church as an expiation, and it shall be called
Kerna (#B#, #C#).

#F[:a]r[:o]e.# 'Torkilds Riim, eller St. Catharin[ae] Vise, 'Lyngbye,
F[ae]r[/o]iske Qv[ae]der, p. 534/p. 535. In this form of the story,
as in the Icelandic versions which follow, the robbers are not the
brothers of the maids. Torkild's two daughters sleep till the sun
shines on their beds. Their father wakens them, and tells Katrine she
is waited for at church. Katrine dresses herself splendidly, but does
not disdain to saddle her own horse.

    And since no knave was ready to help,
    Katrine bridled the horse herself.

    And since no knave was standing about,
    Herself put the bit in her horse's mouth.

First she came upon three strollers (vadlarar[156]), then two, then one,
and the last asked her whether she would pass the night with him (vera
qv[:o]ldar vujv) or die. He cut off her head, and wherever her blood ran a
light kindled; where her head fell a spring welled forth: where her body
lay a church was [afterwards] built. The rover came to Torkild's house,
and the father asked if he had seen Katrine. He said she had been at
Mary kirk the day before, and asked for a lodging, feigning to be sick.
This was readily granted. He went to bed, and Aasa, the other sister,
waited upon him. He offered her a silken sark to sleep with him. Aasa
asked to see the sark first, and found on it her sister's mark. The
fellow went on to offer her a blue cloak and gold crown successively,
and on both of these she saw her sister's mark. Aasa bade him
good-night, went to her father, and told him that the man they had
housed had killed his daughter. Torkild ordered his swains to light a
pile in the wood: early the next morning they burned the murderer on it.

#Icelandic.# Five Icelandic versions, and the first stanza of two more,
are given in ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, I, 108 ff, No 15, 'Vallara
kv[ae][dh]i.'

The story is nearly the same as in the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad. Two of
Thorkell's daughters sleep till after the sun is up (#B#, #C#). They
wash and dress; they set out for church (#C#). On the heath they
encounter a strolling man, #A#; a tall, large man, #C#, #E#; a horseman
or knight, #D#. He greets them: "Why will ye not speak? Are ye come
of elves, or of kings themselves?" #A# [Are ye come of earls, or of
beggar-churls? #B#]. They answer, We are not come of elves, nor of
kings themselves; we are Thorkell's daughters, and serve Mary kirk. He
asks, Will ye choose to lose your life, or shall I rather take you to
wife? The choice, they say, is hard: they would rather die. He kills
them and buries them. At night he goes to Thorkell's house, where Asa
is alone. He knocks to be let in; Asa refuses; he draws the latch with
his deft fingers (#A#, #C#, #D#). He offers Asa a silken sark to sleep
with him [and a blue cloak to say nothing, #A#]. She asked to see the
sark, and knew her sisters' work, begged him to wait a moment, went to
her father, and told him that the murderer of his daughters was there.
Thorkell dashed his harp to the floor [and kicked over the table, #D#,
#E#]. The murderer in the morning was hanged like a dog, #A#, #B#.
[Thorkell tore at his hair and cut him down with an elder-stock, #C#;
they fought three days, and on the fourth the villain was hanged in a
strap, #E#, the knight was hanging like a dog, #D#]. A miraculous light
burned over the place where the maids had been buried, #A# 16, #C# 27,
#D# 24, #E# 12. When their bodies were taken into the church, the bells
rang of themselves, #D#.

#Norwegian# versions of this ballad have been obtained from tradition,
but none as yet have been published.

"The mains and burn of Fordie, the banks of which are very beautiful,"
says Aytoun (I, 159), "lie about six miles to the east of Dunkeld."
Tradition has connected the story with half a dozen localities in
Sweden, and, as Professor Grundtvig informs me, with at least eight
places in the different provinces of Denmark. The Kerna church of the
Swedish ballads, not far from Link[:o]ping (Afzelius), has been popularly
supposed to derive its name from a Catharina, Karin, or Karna, killed by
her own brother, a wood-robber, near its site. See Afzelius, ed.
Bergstr[:o]m, II, 329 ff: Danske Viser, III, 444 f.

[156] Lyngbye insists on translating _vadlarar_ pilgrims, though his
people understood the word to mean robbers. He refers to the Icelandic
vallari, which, originally a pilgrim, came to mean a tramp. No one can
fail to recognize the character who has become the terror of our rural
districts, and to whom, in our preposterous regard for the rights of
"man," we sacrifice the peace, and often the lives, of women.

LEESOME BRAND

        #A.# 'Leesome Brand.' #a.# Buchan's Ballads of the North
        of Scotland, I, 38. #b.# Motherwell's MS., p. 626.

        #B.# 'The Broom blooms bonnie,' etc., Motherwell's MS., p.
        365.


This is one of the cases in which a remarkably fine ballad has been
worse preserved in Scotland than anywhere else. Without light from
abroad we cannot fully understand even so much as we have saved, and
_with_ this light comes a keen regret for what we have lost.

#A#, from Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, is found also in
Motherwell's MS., but without doubt was derived from Buchan. Though
injured by the commixture of foreign elements, #A# has still much of the
original story. #B# has, on the contrary, so little that distinctively
and exclusively belongs to this story that it might almost as well have
been put with the following ballad, 'Sheath and Knife,' as here. A third
ballad, 'The Birth of Robin Hood,' preserves as much of the story as
#A#, but in an utterly incongruous and very modern setting, being, like
'Erlinton,' #C#, forced into an absurd Robin Hood framework.

The mixture of four-line with two-line stanzas in #A# of course comes
from different ballads having been blended, but for all that, these
ballads might have had the same theme. Stanzas 33-35, however, are such
as we meet with in ballads of the 'Earl Brand' class, but not in those
of the class to which 'Leesome Brand' belongs. In the English ballads,
and nearly all the Danish, of the former class, there is at least a
conversation between son and mother [father], whereas in the other the
catastrophe excludes such a possibility. Again, the "unco land" in the
first stanza, "where winds never blew nor cocks ever crew," is at least
a reminiscence of the paradise depicted in the beginning of many of the
versions of 'Ribold and Guldborg,' and stanza 4 of 'Leesome Brand'
closely resembles stanza 2 of 'Earl Brand,' #A#.[157] Still, the first
and fourth stanzas suit one ballad as well as the other, which is not
true of 33-35.

The name Leesome Brand may possibly be a corruption of Hildebrand, as
Earl Brand almost certainly is; but a more likely origin is the
Gysellannd of one of the kindred Danish ballads.

The white hind, stanzas 28, 30, is met with in no other ballad of this
class, and, besides this, the last four stanzas are in no kind of
keeping with what goes before, for the "young son" is spoken of as
having been first brought home at some previous period. Grundtvig has
suggested that the hind and the blood came from a lost Scottish ballad
resembling 'The Maid Transformed into a Hind,' D.g.F, No 58. In this
ballad a girl begs her brother, who is going hunting, to spare the
little hind that "plays before his foot." The brother nevertheless
shoots the hind, though not mortally, and sets to work to flay it, in
which process he discovers his sister under the hind's hide. His sister
tells him that she had been successively changed into a pair of
scissors, a sword, a hare, a hind, by her step-mother, and that she was
not to be free of the spell until she had drunk of her brother's blood.
Her brother at once cuts his fingers, gives her some of his blood, and
the girl is permanently restored to her natural shape, and afterwards is
happily married. Stanzas similar to 36-41 of #A# and 12-16 of #B# will
be found in the ballad which follows this, to which they are especially
well suited by their riddling character; and I believe that they belong
there, and not here. It is worthy of remark, too, that there is a _hind_
in another ballad, closely related to No 16 ('The Bonny Hind'), and that
the hind in 'Leesome Brand' may, in some way not now explicable, have
come from this. The confounding of 'Leesome Brand' with a ballad of the
'Bonny Hind' class would be paralleled in Danish, for in 'Redselille og
Medelvold' #T# (and perhaps #I#, see Grundtvig's note, V, 237), the
knight is the lady's brother.

The "auld son" in #B#, like the first bringing home of the _young_ son
in #A# 45, 47, shows how completely the proper story has been lost sight
of. There should be no son of any description at the point at which this
stanza comes in, and _auld_ son should everywhere be _young_ son. The
best we can do, to make sense of stanza 3, is to put it after 8, with
the understanding that woman and child are carried off for burial;
though really there is no need to move them on that account. The
shooting of the child is unintelligible in the mutilated state of the
ballad. It is apparently meant to be an accident. Nothing of the kind
occurs in other ballads of the class, and the divergence is probably a
simple corruption.

The ballad which 'Leesome Brand' represents is preserved among the
Scandinavian races under four forms.

#Danish.# I. 'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L[:o]n,' a single copy from a manuscript
of the beginning of the 17th century: Grundtvig, V, 231, No 270. II.
'Redselille og Medelvold,' in an all but unexampled number of versions,
of which some sixty are collated, and some twenty-five printed, by
Grundtvig, most of them recently obtained from tradition, and the oldest
a broadside of about the year 1770: Grundtvig, V, 234, No 271. III.
'S[:o]nnens Sorg,' Grundtvig, V, 289, No 272, two versions only: #A# from
the middle of the 16th century; #B# three hundred years later,
previously printed in Berggreen's Danske Folkesange, I, No 83 (3d ed.).
IV. 'Stalbroders Kvide,' Grundtvig, V, 301, No 273, two versions: #A#
from the beginning of the 17th century, #B# from about 1570.

#Swedish.# II. #A#, broadside of 1776, reprinted in Grundtvig, No 271,
V, 281, Bilag 1, and in Jamieson's Illustrations, p. 373 ff, with a
translation. #B#, 'Herr Redevall,' Afzelius, II, 189, No 58, new ed. No
51. #C#, 'Krist' Lilla och Herr Tideman,' Arwidsson, I, 352, No 54 A.
#D#, #E#, #F#, #G#, from Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection,
first printed by Grundtvig, No 271, V, 282 ff, Bilag 2-5. #H#, 'Rosa
lilla,' Eva Wigstr[:o]m, Folkvisor fr[oa]n Sk[oa]ne, in Ur de nordiska
Folkens Lif, af Artur Hazelius, p. 133, No 8. III. A single version, of
date about 1650, 'Moder och Son,' Arwidsson, II, 15, No 70.

#Norwegian.# II. Six versions and a fragment, from recent tradition:
#A-E#, #G#, first printed by Grundtvig, No 271, V, 284 ff, Bilag 6-11;
#F#, 'Grivilja,' in Lindeman's Norske Fjeldmelodier, No 121. III. Six
versions from recent tradition, #A-F#, first printed by Grundtvig, No
272, V, 297 ff, Bilag I-6.

#Icelandic.# III. 'Sonar harmur,' ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, I, 140
ff, No 17, three versions, #A#, #B#, #C#, the last, which is the
oldest, being from late in the 17th century; also the first stanza of a
fourth, #D#.

All the Scandinavian versions are in two-line stanzas save Danish 272
#B#, and #A# in part, and Icelandic 17 #C#, which are in four; the last,
however, in stanzas of two couplets.

It will be most convenient to give first a summary of the story of
'Redselille og Medelvold,' and to notice the chief divergences of the
other ballads afterwards. A mother and her daughter are engaged in
weaving gold tissue. The mother sees milk running from the girl's
breasts, and asks an explanation. After a slight attempt at evasion, the
daughter confesses that she has been beguiled by a knight. The mother
threatens both with punishment: he shall be hanged [burned, broken on
the wheel, sent out of the country, i.e., sold into servitude], and she
sent away [broiled on a gridiron, burned, drowned]. Some copies begin
further back, with a stanza or two in which we are told that the knight
has served in the king's court, and gained the favor of the king's
daughter. Alarmed by her mother's threats, the maid goes to her lover's
house at night, and after some difficulty in effecting an entrance (a
commonplace, like the ill-boding milk above) informs him of the fate
that awaits them. The knight is sufficiently prompt now, and bids her
get her gold together while he saddles his horse. They ride away, with
[or without] precautions against discovery, and come to a wood. Four
Norwegian versions, #A#, #B#, #C#, #G#, and also two Icelandic versions,
#A#, #B#, of 'S[/o]nnens Sorg,' interpose a piece of water, and a
difficulty in crossing, owing to the ferryman's refusing help or the
want of oars; but this passage is clearly an infiltration from a
different story. Arriving at the wood, the maid desires to rest a while.
The customary interrogation does not fail,--whether the way is too long
or the saddle too small. The knight lifts her off the horse, spreads his
cloak for her on the grass, and she gives way to her anguish in such
exclamations as "My mother had nine women: would that I had the worst of
them!" "My mother would never have been so angry with me but she would
have helped me in this strait!" Most of the Danish versions make the
knight offer to bandage his eyes and render such service as a man may;
but she replies that she would rather die than that man should know of
woman's pangs. So Swedish #H#, nearly. Partly to secure privacy, and
partly from thirst, she expresses a wish for water, and her lover goes
in search of some. (This in nearly all the Danish ballads, and many of
the others. But in four of the Norwegian versions of 'S[/o]nnens Sorg' the
lover is told to go and amuse himself, much as in our ballads.) When he
comes to the spring or the brook, there sits a nightingale and sings.
_Two_ nightingales, a small bird, a voice from heaven, a small dwarf, an
old man, replace the nightingale in certain copies, and in others there
is nothing at all; but the great majority has a single nightingale, and,
as Grundtvig points out, the single bird is right, for the bird is
really a vehicle for the soul of the dead Redselille. The nightingale
sings, "Redselille lies dead in the wood, with two sons [son and
daughter] in her bosom." All that the nightingale has said is found to
be true. According to Danish #O# and Swedish #C#, the knight finds the
lady and a child, according to Swedish #B# and Norwegian #A#, #B#, #C#,
the lady and two sons, dead. In Danish #B#, #L# (as also the Icelandic
'Sonar Harmur,' #A#, #B#, and Danish 'Stalbroders Kvide,' #A#) the
knight digs a grave, and lays mother and children in it; he lays himself
with them in #A# and #M#. It is not said whether the children are dead
or living, and the point would hardly be raised but for what follows. In
Danish #D#, #P# and Swedish #F#, it is expressly mentioned that the
children are _alive_, and in #Q#, #R#, #S#, #T#, #U#, six copies of #V#,
and #Y#, and also in 'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L[/o]n,' and in 'S[/o]nnens Sorg,'
Danish #A#, Norwegian #A#, #C#, #D#, #E#, the children are heard, or
seem to be heard, shrieking from under the ground. Nearly all the
versions make the knight run himself through with his sword, either
immediately after the others are laid in the grave, or after he has
ridden far and wide, because he cannot endure the cries of the children
from under the earth. This would seem to be the original conclusion of
the story; the horrible circumstance of the children being buried alive
is much more likely to be slurred over or omitted at a later day than to
be added.

We may pass over in silence the less important variations in the very
numerous versions of 'Redselille and Medelvold,' nor need we be detained
long by the other three Scandinavian forms of the ballad. 'S[/o]nnens Sorg'
stands in the same relation to 'Redselille and Medelvold' as 'Hildebrand
and Hilde,' does to 'Ribold and Guldborg' (see p. 89 of this volume);
that is, the story is told in the first person instead of the third. A
father asks his son why he is so sad, Norwegian #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#,
Icelandic #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#. Five years has he sat at his father's
board, and never uttered a merry word. The son relates the tragedy of
his life. He had lived in his early youth at the house of a nobleman,
who had three daughters. He was on very familiar terms with all of them,
and the youngest loved him. When the time came for him to leave the
family, she proposed that he should take her with him, Danish #B#,
Icelandic #A#, #B#, #C# [_he_ makes the proposal in Norwegian #C#]. From
this point the narrative is much the same as in 'Redselille and
Medelvold,' and at the conclusion he falls dead in his father's arms [at
the table], Norwegian #A#, #B#, #D#, Icelandic #A#. The mother takes the
place of the father in Danish #B# and Swedish, and perhaps it is the
mother who tells the story in English #A#, but the bad condition of the
text scarcely enables us to say. Danish #B# and the Swedish copy have
lost the middle and end of the proper story: there is no wood, no
childbirth, no burial. The superfluous boat of some Norwegian versions
of 'Redselille' reappears in these, and also in Icelandic #A#, #B#; it
is overturned in a storm, and the lady is drowned.

'Stalbroders Kvide' differs from 'S[/o]nnens Sorg' only in this: that the
story is related to a comrade instead of father or mother.

'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L[/o]n,' which exists but in a single copy, has a
peculiar beginning. Sir Nilaus has served eight years in the king's
court without recompense. He has, however, gained the favor of the
king's daughter, who tells him that she is suffering much on his
account. If this be so, says Nilaus, I will quit the land with speed. He
is told to wait till she has spoken to her mother. She goes to her
mother and says: Sir Nilaus has served eight years, and had no reward;
he desires the best that it is in your power to give. The queen
exclaims, He shall never have my only daughter's hand! The young lady
immediately bids Nilaus saddle his horse while she collects her gold,
and from this point we have the story of Redselille.

#Dutch.# Willems, Oude vlaemsche Liederen, p. 482, No 231, 'De Ruiter en
Mooi Elsje;' Hoffmann v. Fallersleben, Niederl[:a]ndische Volkslieder, 2d
ed., p. 170, No 75: broadside of the date 1780.

A mother inquires into her daughter's condition, and learns that she is
going with child by a trooper (he is called both 'ruiter' and
'landsknecht'). The conversation is overheard by the other party, who
asks the girl whether she will ride with him or bide with her mother.
She chooses to go with him, and as they ride is overtaken with pains.
She asks whether there is not a house where she can rest. The soldier
builds her a hut of thistles, thorns, and high stakes, and hangs his
cloak over the aperture. She asks him to go away, and to come back when
he hears a cry: but the maid was dead ere she cried. The trooper laid
his head on a stone, and his heart brake with grief.

#German.# #A#, Simrock, No 40, p. 92, 'Von Farbe so bleich,' from Bonn
and Rheindorf, repeated in Mittler, No 194. The mother, on learning her
daughter's plight, imprecates a curse on her. The maid betakes herself
to her lover, a trooper, who rides off with her. They come to a cool
spring, and she begs for a fresh drink, but, feeling very ill, asks if
there is no hamlet near, from which she could have woman's help. The
aid of the trooper is rejected in the usual phrase, and he is asked
to go aside, and answer when called. If there should be no call, she
will be dead. There was no call, and she was found to be dead, with
two sons in her bosom. The trooper wrapped the children in her apron,
and dug her grave with his sword. #B#, Reifferscheid, Westf[:a]lische
Volkslieder, p. 106, 'Ach Wunder [:u]ber Wunder,' from B[:o]kendorf:
much the same as to the story. #C#, Mittler, No 195, p. 175, 'Von
Farbe so bleich,' a fragment of a copy from Hesse; Zuccalmaglio, p.
187, No 90, 'Die Waisen,' an entire copy, ostensibly from the Lower
Rhine, but clearly owing its last fourteen stanzas to the editor. The
trooper, in this supplement, leaves the boys with his mother, and goes
over seas. The boys grow up, and set out to find their father. In
the course of their quest, they pass a night in a hut in a wood, and
are overheard saying a prayer for their father and dead mother, by a
person who announces herself as their maternal grandmother! After this
it is not surprising that the father himself should turn up early the
next morning. The same editor, under the name of Montanus, gives in
Die deutschen Volksfeste, p. 45 f, a part of this ballad again, with
variations which show his hand beyond a doubt. We are here informed
that the ballad has above a hundred stanzas, and that the conclusion is
that the grandmother repents her curse, makes her peace with the boys,
and builds a convent.

#French.# Bujeaud, Chants et Chansons populaires des provinces de
l'Ouest, #A#, I, 198, #B#, I, 200, 'J'entends le rossignolet.' #A#. This
ballad has suffered injury at the beginning and the end, but still
preserves very well the chief points of the story. A lover has promised
his mistress that after returning from a long absence he would take her
to see his country. While traversing a wood she is seized with her
pains. The aid of her companion is declined: "Cela n'est point votre
m['e]tier." She begs for water. The lover goes for some, and meets a lark,
who tells him that he will find his love dead, with a child in her arms.
Two stanzas follow which are to no purpose. #B#. The other copy of this
ballad has a perverted instead of a meaningless conclusion, but this
keeps some traits that are wanting in #A#. It is a two-line ballad, with
the nightingale in the refrain: "J'entends le rossignolet." A fair maid,
walking with her lover, falls ill, and lies down under a thorn. The
lover asks if he shall go for her mother. "She would not come: she has a
cruel heart." Shall I go for mine? "Go, like the swallow!" He comes back
and finds his love dead, and says he will die with his mistress. The
absurd conclusion follows that she was feigning death to test his love.

The names in the Scandinavian ballads, it is remarked by Grundtvig, V,
242, 291, are not Norse, but probably of German derivation, and, if
such, would indicate a like origin for the story. The man's name, for
instance, in the Danish 'S[/o]nnens Sorg,' #A#, Gysellannd, seems to point
to Gisalbrand or Gisalbald, German names of the 8th or 9th century.
There is some doubt whether this Gysellannd is not due to a corruption
arising in the course of tradition (see Grundtvig, V, 302); but if the
name may stand, it will account for our Leesome Brand almost as
satisfactorily as Hildebrand does for Earl Brand in No 7.

The passage in which the lady refuses male assistance during her
travail--found as well in almost all the Danish versions of 'Redselille
and Medelvold,' in the German and French, and imperfectly in Swedish
#D#--occurs in several other English ballads, viz., 'The Birth of Robin
Hood,' 'Rose the Red and White Lily,' 'Sweet Willie,' of Finlay's
Scottish Ballads, II, 61, 'Burd Helen,' of Buchan, II, 30, 'Bonnie
Annie,' No 23. Nearly the whole of the scene in the wood is in
'Wolfdietrich.' Wolfdietrich finds a dead man and a woman naked to the
girdle, who is clasping the stem of a tree. The man, who was her
husband, was taking her to her mother's house, where her first child was
to be born, when he was attacked by the dragon Schadesam. She was now in
the third day of her travail. Wolfdietrich, having first wrapped her in
his cloak, offers his help, requesting her to tear a strip from her
shift and bind it round his eyes. She rejects his assistance in this
form, but sends him for water, which he brings in his helmet, but only
to find the woman dead, with a lifeless child at her breast. He wraps
mother and child in his mantle, carries them to a chapel, and lays them
on the altar; then digs a grave with his sword, goes for the body of the
man, and buries all three in the grave he has made. Grimm, Altd[:a]nische

    Ane for him, and another for her,
    To carry them baith wi might and virr.

    17
    He's done him to her mother's coffer,
    And there he 's taen his lover's tocher;

    18
    Wherein were sixty thousand pound,
    Which all to her by right belongd.

    19
    When they had ridden about six mile,
    His true love then began to fail.

    20
    'O wae's me,' said that gay ladye,
    'I fear my back will gang in three!

    21
    'O gin I had but a gude midwife,
    Here this day to save my life,

    22
    'And ease me o my misery,
    O dear, how happy I woud be!'

    23
    'My love, we're far frae ony town,
    There is nae midwife to be foun.

    24
    'But if ye'll be content wi me,
    I'll do for you what man can dee.'

    25
    'For no, for no, this maunna be,'
    Wi a sigh, replied this gay ladye.

    26
    'When I endure my grief and pain,
    My companie ye maun refrain.

    27
    'Ye'll take your arrow and your bow,
    And ye will hunt the deer and roe.

    28
    'Be sure ye touch not the white hynde,
    For she is o the woman kind.'

    29
    He took sic pleasure in deer and roe,
    Till he forgot his gay ladye.

    30
    Till by it came that milk-white hynde,
    And then he mind on his ladye syne.

    31
    He hasted him to yon greenwood tree,
    For to relieve his gay ladye;

    32
    But found his ladye lying dead,
    Likeways her young son at her head.

    33
    His mother lay ower her castle wa,
      And she beheld baith dale and down;
    And she beheld young Leesome Brand,
      As he came riding to the town.

    34
    'Get minstrels for to play,' she said,
      'And dancers to dance in my room;
    For here comes my son, Leesome Brand,
      And he comes merrilie to the town.'

    35
    'Seek nae minstrels to play, mother,
      Nor dancers to dance in your room;
    But tho your son comes, Leesome Brand,
      Yet he comes sorry to the town.

    36
    'O I hae lost my gowden knife;
    I rather had lost my ain sweet life!

    37
    'And I hae lost a better thing,
    The gilded sheath that it was in.'

    38
    'Are there nae gowdsmiths here in Fife,
    Can make to you anither knife?

    'Put in your hand at my bed head,

    He put his hand at her bed head,
      And there he found a gude grey horn,

      That had been there sin he was born.

    47

The three stanzas of this ballad which are found in the Musical Museum
(#C#) were furnished, it is said, by Burns. It was first printed in full
(#A b#) in Motherwell's Minstrelsy. Motherwell retouched a verse here
and there slightly, to regulate the metre. #A a# is here given as it
stands in his manuscript. #B# consists of some scattered verses as
remembered by Sir W. Scott.

The directions in 3, 4 receive light from a passage in 'Robin Hood's
Death and Burial:'

    'But give me my bent bow in my hand,
      And a broad arrow I'll let flee,
    And where this arrow is taken up
      There shall my grave diggd be.

    'Lay me a green sod under my head,' etc.

Other ballads with a like theme are 'The Bonny Hind,' further on in this
volume, and the two which follow it.

A defective copy of this ballad was printed in Cromek's Select Scottish
Songs, Ancient and Modern, 1810 (#D#). A fragment, comprising the first
half of the story, was inserted in "Lowran Castle, or the Wild Boar of
Curridoo: with other Tales," etc., by Robert Trotter, Dumfries,
1822[159] (#F#). A complete copy was first given in Kinloch's Ancient
Scottish Ballads, 1827 (#G#); another, described by the editor as made
up from Cromek's fragment and two copies from recitation, in
Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 36,[160] later in the same year; and a
third, closely resembling Kinloch's, in Buchan's Ballads of the North of
Scotland, in 1828 (#H#). Three versions complete, or nearly so, and a
fragment of a fourth are now printed for the first time, all from
Motherwell's manuscripts (#A#, #B#, #C#, #E#).

The stanza about the auger bore [wimble bore], #B# 1, #F# 3, #H# 4, is
manifestly out of place. It is found in 'The Whummil Bore' (see further
on), and may have slipped into 'Hind Horn' by reason of its following,
in its proper place, a stanza beginning, "Seven lang years I hae served
the king:" cf. #F# 2, #H# 3.

#G# 17, 18, 21, 22, which are not intelligible in their present
connection, are perhaps, as well as #G# 16, #H# 18-20, borrowed from
some Robin Hood ballad, in which a change is made with a beggar.

The noteworthy points in the story of Hind Horn are these. Hind Horn has
served the king seven years (#D#, #F#), and has fallen in love with his
daughter. She gives Hind Horn a jewelled ring: as long as the stone
keeps its color, he may know that she is faithful; but if it changes
hue, he may ken she loves another man. The king is angry (#D#), and Hind
Horn goes to sea [is sent, #D#]. He has been gone seven years, #E#, #F#
[seven years and a day, #B#], when, looking on his ring, he sees that
the stone is pale and wan, #A-H#. He makes for the land at once, and,
meeting an old beggar, asks him for news. No news but the king's
daughter's wedding: it has lasted nine days [two and forty, #A#], and
she will not go into the bride-bed till she hears of Hind Horn, #E#.
Hind Horn changed cloaks and other gear with the beggar, and when he
came to the king's gate asked for a drink in Horn's name,[161] #A#, #B#,
#D#. The bride herself came down, and gave him a drink out of her own
hand, #A#, #B#, #C#, #G#, #H#. He drank out the drink and dropped in the
ring.

    'O gat ye 't by sea, or gat ye 't by lan,
    Or gat ye 't aff a dead man's han?'

So she asked; and he answered:

    'I gat na 't by sea, I gat na 't by lan,
    But I gat it out of your own han.' #D# 14.

    'I got na 't by sea, I got na 't by land,
    Nor got I it aff a drownd man's hand;

    'But I got it at my wooing,
    And I'll gie it at your wedding.' #G# 29, 30.

The bride, who had said,

    'I'll go through nine fires so hot,
    But I'll give him a drink for Young Hynhorn's sake,' #B# 16,

is no less ready now:

    'I'll tak the red gowd frae my head,
    And follow you and beg my bread.

    'I'll tak the red gowd frae my hair,
    And follow you for evermair.' #H# 31, 32.

But Hind Horn let his cloutie cloak fall, #G#, #H#, and told her,

    'Ye need na leave your bridal gown,
    For I'll make ye ladie o many a town.'

The story of Horn, of which this ballad gives little more than the
catastrophe, is related at full in

Horn, in the old English _gest_, is son of Murry [Allof], king of
Suddenne. He is a youth of extraordinary beauty, and has twelve
comrades, of whom Athulf and Fikenild are his favorites. One day, as
Murry was out riding, he came upon fifteen ships of Saracens, just
arrived. The pagans slew the king, and insured themselves, as they
thought, against Horn's future revenge by putting him and his twelve
aboard a vessel without sail or rudder; but "the children" drove to
shore, unhurt, on the coast of Westerness. The king, Ailmar, gave them a
kind reception, and committed them to Athelbrus, his steward, to be
properly brought up. Rymenhild, the king's daughter, fell in love with
Horn, and having, with some difficulty, prevailed upon Athelbrus to
bring him to her bower, offered herself to him as his wife. It were no
fair wedding, Horn told her, between a thrall and a king,--a speech
which hurt Rymenhild greatly; and Horn was so moved by her grief that he
promised to do all she required, if she would induce the king to knight
him. This was done the next day, and Horn at once knighted all his
comrades. Rymenhild again sent for Horn, and urged him now to make her
his wife. But Horn said he must first prove his knighthood: if he came
back alive, he would then marry her. Upon this Rymenhild gave him a
ring, set with stones of such virtue that he could never be slain if he
looked on it and thought of his leman. The young knight had the good
fortune to fall in immediately with a ship full of heathen hounds, and
by the aid of his ring killed a hundred of the best of them. The next
day he paid Rymenhild a visit, and found her drowned in grief on account
of a bad dream. She had cast her net in the sea, and a great fish had
broken it: she weened she should lose the fish that she would choose.
Horn strove to comfort her, but could not conceal his apprehension that
trouble was brewing. The fish proved to be Fikenild, Horn's much
cherished friend. He told Ailmar of the intimacy with Rymenhild, and
asserted that Horn meant to kill the king as well as marry the princess.
Ailmar was very angry (v. 724, Wissmann), and much grieved, too. He
found the youth in his daughter's bower, and ordered him to quit the
land anon. Horn saddled his horse and armed himself, then went back to
Rymenhild, and told her that he was going to a strange land for seven
years: if, after that, he neither came nor sent word, she might take a
husband. He sailed a good way eastward (v. 799) to Ireland, and,
landing, met two princes, who invited him to take service with their
father. The king, Thurston, welcomed him, and had soon occasion to
employ him; for at Christmas came into court a giant, with a message
from pagans newly arrived. They proposed that one of them should fight
three Christians:

    'If your three slay our one.
    Let all this land be your own;
    If our one oercomes your three,
    All this land then ours shall be.'

Horn scorned to fight on such terms; he alone would undertake three of
the hounds; and so he did. In the course of a hard fight it came out
that these were the very heathen that had slain King Murry. Horn looked
on his ring and thought on Rymenhild, then fell on his foes. Not a man
of them escaped; but King Thurston lost many men in the fight, among
them his two sons. Having now no heir, he offered Horn his daughter
Reynild and the succession. Horn replied that he had not earned such a
reward yet. He would serve the king further; and when he asked for his
daughter, he hoped the king would not refuse her.

Seven years Horn stayed with King Thurston, and to Rymenhild neither
sent nor went. A sorry time it was for her, and worst at the end, for
King Modi of Reynis asked her in marriage, and her father consented. The
wedding was to be in a few days. Rymenhild despatched messengers to
every land, but Horn heard nothing, till one day, when he was going out
to shoot, he encountered one of these, and learned how things stood. He
sent word to his love not to be troubled; he would be there betimes.
But, alas, the messenger was drowned on his way back, and Rymenhild,
peering out of her door for a ray of hope, saw his body washed up by the
waves. Horn now made a clean breast to Thurston, and asked for help.
This was generously accorded, and Horn set sail for Westerness. He
arrived not too early on the day of the wedding,--"ne might he come no
later!"--left his men in a wood, and set off for Ailmar's court alone.
He met a palmer, and asked his news. The palmer had come from a bridal;
a wedding of maid Rymenhild, who wept and would not be married, because
she had a husband, though he was out of the land. Horn changed clothes
with the palmer, put on the sclavin, took scrip and staff, blackened his
skin and twisted his lip, and presented himself at the king's gate. The
porter would not let him in; Horn kicked open the wicket, threw the
porter over the bridge, made his way into the hall, and sat down in the
beggars' row. Rymenhild was weeping as if she were out of her wits, but
after meat she rose to give all the knights and squires drink from a
horn which she bare: such was the custom. Horn called to her:

    'Skink us with the first,
    The beggars ben athirst.'

She laid down her horn and filled him a gallon bowl; but Horn would not
drink of that. He said, mysteriously, "Thou thinkest I am a beggar, but
I am a fisher, come far from the East, to fish at thy feast. My net lies
near at hand, and hath full seven year. I am come to see if it has taken
any fish.

    'I am come to fish;
    Drink to me from thy dish,
    Drink to Horn from horn!'"

Rymenhild looked at him, a chill creeping over her heart. What he meant
by his fishing she did not see. She filled her horn and drank to him,
handed it to the pilgrim, and said, "Drink thy fill, and tell me if ever
thou saw Horn." Horn drank, and threw the ring into the vessel. When the
princess went to bower, she found the ring she had given Horn. She
feared he was dead, and sent for the palmer. The palmer said Horn had
died on the voyage to Westerness, and had begged him to go with the ring
to Rymenhild. Rymenhild could bear no more. She threw herself on her
bed, where she had hid a knife, to kill both King Modi and herself if
Horn should not come; she set the knife to her heart, and there Horn
stopped her. He wiped off the black, and cried, "I am Horn!" Great was
their bliss, but it was not a time to indulge themselves fully.

    Horn sprang out of hall,
    And let his sclavin fall,      (1246)

and went to summon his knights. Rymenhild sent after him the faithful
Athulf, who all the while had been watching for Horn in the tower. They
slew all that were in the castle, except King Ailmar and Horn's old
comrades. Horn spared even Fikenild, taking an oath of fidelity from him
and the rest. Then he made himself known to Ailmar, denied what he had
been charged with, and would not marry Rymenhild even now, not till he
had won back Suddenne. This he went immediately about; but while he was
engaged in clearing the land of Saracens and rebuilding churches, the
false Fikenild bribed young and old to side with him, built a strong
castle, "married" Rymenhild, carried her into his fortress, and began a
feast. Horn, warned in a dream, again set sail for Westerness, and came
in by Fikenild's new castle. Athulf's cousin was on the shore, to tell
him what had happened; how Fikenild had wedded Rymenhild that very day;
he had beguiled Horn twice. Force would not avail now. Horn disguised
himself and some of his knights as harpers and fiddlers, and their music
gained them admittance. Horn began a lay which threw Rymenhild into a
swoon. This smote him to the heart; he looked on his ring and thought of
her. Fikenhild and his men were soon disposed of. Horn was in a
condition to reward all his faithful adherents. He married Athulf to
Thurston's daughter, and made Rymenhild queen of Suddenne.

The French romance contains very nearly the same story, extended, by
expansions of various sorts, to about six times the length of King Horn.
It would be out of place to notice other variations than those which
relate to the story preserved in the ballads. Rimild offers Horn a ring
when she first avows her love. He will not take it then, but accepts a
second tender, after his first fight. When he is accused to the king, he
offers to clear himself by combat with heavy odds, but will not submit,
king's son as he is, to purgation by oath. The king says, then he may
quit the land and go--to Norway, if he will. Horn begs Rimild to
maintain her love for him seven years. If he does not come then, he will
send her word to act thereafter at her pleasure. Rimild exchanges the
ring she had previously given him for one set with a sapphire, wearing
which faithfully he need not fear death by water nor fire, battle nor
tourney (vv 2051-8). He looks at this ring when he fights with the pagan
that had killed his father, and it fires his heart to extraordinary
exploits (3166 ff). Having learned through a friend, who had long been
seeking him, that Rimild's father is about to marry her to a young king
(Modun), Horn returns to Brittany with a large force. He leaves his men
in a woody place, and goes out alone on horseback for news; meets a
palmer, who tells him that the marriage is to take place that very day;
gives the palmer his fine clothes in exchange for sclavin, staff and
scrip, forces his way into the city, and is admitted to the banquet hall
with the beggars. After the guests had eaten (4152 ff), Rimild filled a
splendid cup with piment, presented it first _a sun dru_, and then, with
her maids, served the whole company. As she was making her fifth round,
Horn pulled her by the sleeve, and reproached her with attending only to
the rich. "Your credit would be greater should you serve _us_." She set
a handsome cup before him, but he would not drink. "Corn apelent Horn li
Engleis," he said. "If, for the love of him who bore that name, you
would give me the same horn that you offered your _ami_, I would share
it with you." All but fainting, Rimild gave him the horn. He threw in
his ring, even that which she had given him at parting, drank out half,
and begged her to drink by the love of him whom he had named. In
drinking, she sipped the ring into her mouth, and she saw at once what
it was (4234). "I have found a ring," said she. "If it is yours, take
it. Blest be he to whom I gave it: if you know aught of him, conceal it
not. If you are Horn, it were a great sin not to reveal yourself." Horn
owned that the ring was his, but denied knowledge of the man she spake
of. For himself, he had been reared in that land, and by service had
come into possession of a hawk, which, before taming it, he had put in a
cage: that was nigh seven years since: he had come now to see what it
amounted to. If it should prove to be as good as when he left it, he
would carry it away with him; but if its feathers were ruffled and
broken, he would have nothing to do with it. At this, Rimild broke into
a laugh, and cried, "Horn, 't is you, and your hawk has been safely
kept!"[162] She would go with him or kill herself. Horn saw that she had
spoken truth, but, to try her yet further, said he was indeed Horn, whom
she had loved, but he had come back with nothing: why should she follow
a poor wretch who could not give her a gown to her back? "Little do you
know me," was her reply. "I can bear what you bear, and there is no king
in the East for whom I would quit you."

'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' with many diversities of its own as to
details, is more like the French than the English romance as to the
story, and, on the other hand, has one or two resemblances to the
ballads which they both lack. Rimnild's father, maddened by the traitor
Wikel's false information, beats her till she bleeds, and threatens to
slay Horn. Rimnild, expecting her lover to be at least exiled, assures
Horn that she will marry no other man for seven years. The king, who had
shut himself up till his first wrath was past, tells Horn, when he next
comes into his presence, that if he is found in the land on the morrow,
he shall be drawn with horses and hanged. Rimnild, at parting, gives him
a ring, with these words:

    'Loke thou forsake it for no thing,
    It schal ben our tokening;
      The ston it is wele trewe.
    When the ston wexeth wan,
    Than chaungeth the thou[gh]t of thi leman,
      Take than a newe;
    When the ston wexeth rede,
    Than have Y lorn mi maidenhed,
      O[gh]aines the untrewe.'

                              (Michel, st. 48.)

Horn, for his part, bids her every day look into a spring in her arbor:
should she see his shadow, then he is about to marry another; till then
his thought will not have changed (sts 48, 49). Though loved, as before,
by another princess, Horn kept his faith; but when seven years were
gone, on looking at the stone he saw that its hue was changed (st. 71).
He immediately gathered a force, and set sail for Rimnild. On landing he
saw a beggar, who turned out to be one of his old friends, and had been
looking for him a long time. That day Moging the king was to marry
Rimnild. They changed weeds (76); Horn forced his way into the castle.
While Rimnild was serving the guests, Horn, who had tried to pass for a
fool, called to her to attend to God's men. She fetched him drink, and
he said, "For Horn's love, if ever he was dear to thee, go not ere this
be drunk." He threw the ring into the cup: she brought him another drink
(something is wrong here, for nothing is said of her seeing and
recognizing the ring), and asked if Horn were there. She fainted when
she learned that he was, but on recovering sent Hatherof (==Athulf) to
bid the king make merry, and then to gather periwinkle and ivy, "grasses
that ben of main" (to stain her face with, no doubt), and then to tell
Horn to wait for her under a woodside.

    'When al this folk is gon to play,
    He and Y schal steal oway,
    Bituene the day and the ni[gh]t.'      (87)

Hatherof did his message. Of true love Horn was sure. He said he would
come into the field with a hundred knights. A tournament follows, as in
the French romance; the royal bridegroom is unhorsed, but spared;
treachery is punished and forced to confession.

    Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,
    Horn brou[gh]t hir to his bedde.      (94)

That the lay or gest of King Horn is a far more primitive poem than the
French romance, and could not possibly be derived from it, will probably
be plain to any one who will make even a hasty comparison of the two;
and that the contrary opinion should have been held by such men as
Warton and Tyrwhitt must have been the result of a general theory, not
of a particular examination.[163] There is, on the other hand, no
sufficient reason for supposing that the English lay is the source of
the other two poems. Nor do the special approximations of the ballads to
the romance of Horn Child oblige us to conclude that these, or any of
them, are derived from that poem. The particular resemblances are the
discoloration of the ring, the elopement with the bride, in #C#, #G#,
#H# (which is only prepared for, but not carried out, in Horn Child),
and the agreement between the couplet just cited from Horn Child,

    Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,
    Horn brou[gh]t hir to his bedde,

and the last stanza of #A#, #B#, #C#:

    The bridegroom he had wedded the bride,
    But Young Hind Horn he took her to bed.      (#A#)

    The bridegroom thought he had the bonnie bride wed,
    But Young Hyn Horn took the bride to bed.      (#B#)

    Her ain bridegroom had her first wed,
    But Young Hyn Horn had her first to bed.      (#C#)

The likeness evinces a closer affinity of the oral traditions with the
later English romance than with the earlier English or the French, but
no filiation. And were filiation to be accepted, there would remain the
question of priority. It is often assumed, without a misgiving, that
oral tradition must needs be younger than anything that was committed to
writing some centuries ago; but this requires in each case to be made
out; there is certainly no antecedent probability of that kind.[164]

Two Scandinavian ballads, as Dr Prior has remarked, seem to have been at
least suggested by the romances of Horn.

(1.) 'Unge Hr. Tor og Jomfru Tore,' Grundtvig, No 72, II, 263,
translated by Prior, III, 151. Of this there are two traditional
versions: #A# from a manuscript of the sixteenth century, #B# from one
of the seventeenth. They agree in story. In #A#, Tor asks S[/o]lffuermord
how long she will wait for him. Nine years, she answers, if she can do
so without angering her friends. He will be satisfied with eight. Eight
have passed: a family council is held, and it is decided that she shall
not have Young Tor, but a certain rich count. Her father "gives her
away" that same day. The lady goes up to a balcony and looks seaward.
Everybody seems to be coming home but her lover. She begs her brother to
ride down to the shore for her. Tor is just coming in, hails the
horseman, and eagerly asks how are the maids in the isle. The brother
tells him that _his_ maid has waited eight years, and is even now
drinking her bridal, but with tears. Tor takes his harp and chess-board,
and plays outside the bridal hall till the bride hears and knows him. He
then enters the hall, and asks if there is anybody that can win a game
of chess. The father replies, Nobody but S[/o]lffuermord, and she sits a
bride at the board. The mother indulgently suggests that the midsummer
day is long, and the bride might well try a game. The bride seeks an
express sanction of her father, who lessons her the livelong day, being
suspicious of Tor, but towards evening consents to her playing a little
while,--not long. Tor wins the first game, and must needs unpack his
heart in a gibing parable, ending

    'Full hard is gold to win,
    And so is a trothless quean.'

She wins the next game, takes up the parable, and says

    'Many were glad their faith to hold,
    Were their lot to be controlled.'

They are soon at one, and resolve to fly. They slip away, go aboard
Tor's ship, and put off. The bride's parents get information, and the
mother, who is a professor of the black art, raises a storm which she
means shall sink them both. No one can steer the ship but the bride. She
stands at the helm, with her gold crown on, while her lover is lying
seasick on the deck, and she brings the craft safe into Norway, where a
second wedding is celebrated.

(2.) The other ballad is 'Herr Lovmand og Herr Thor,' Syv, iv, No 68,
Danske Viser, IV, 180, No 199, translated by Prior, II, 442. Lovmand,
having betrothed Ingelil, asks how long she will be his maid. "Eight
years, if I may," she says. This term has elapsed; her brothers consult,
and give her to rich Herr Thor. They drink the bridal for five days; for
nine days; she will not go to bed. On the evening of the tenth, they
begin to use force. She begs that she may first go to the look-out
up-stairs. From there she sees ships, great and small, and the sails
which her own hands have made for her lover. Her brother goes down to
the sea, as in the other ballad, and has a similar interview. Lovmand
has the excuse of having been sick seven years. He borrows the brother's
horse, flies faster than a bird, and the torch is burning at the door of
the bride's house when he arrives. Thor is reasonable enough to give up
the bride, and to accept Lovmand's sister.

The ballad is extremely common in Sweden, and at least six versions
have been published. #A#, 'Herr Lagman och Herr Thor,' from a
manuscript of the end of the sixteenth century, Arwidsson, I, 165, No
24; #B#, from a manuscript, _ib._, p. 168; #C#, from oral tradition,
p. 171; #D#, 'Lageman och hans Brud,' Eva Wigstr[:o]m, Folkdiktning
samlad och upptecknad i Sk[oa]ne, p. 29, No 12; #E#, 'Stolt Ingrid,'
Folkvisor fr[oa]u Sk[oa]ne, upptecknade af E. Wigstr[:o]m, in Hazelius,
Ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 121, No 3; #F#, 'Deielill och Lageman,'
Fagerlund, Anteckningar om Korpo och Houtsk[:a]rs Socknar, p. 192,
No 3. In #A#, #D# the bride goes off in her lover's ship; in #C# he
carries her off on his horse, when the dancing is at its best, and
subsequently, upon the king's requisition, settles matters with his
rival by killing him in single fight. The stolid bridegroom, in the
others, consents to a peaceable arrangement.

Certain points in the story of Horn--the long absence, the sudden
return, the appearance under disguise at the wedding feast, and the
dropping of the ring into a cup of wine obtained from the bride--repeat
themselves in a great number of romantic tales. More commonly it is a
husband who leaves his wife for seven years, is miraculously informed on
the last day that she is to be remarried on the morrow, and is restored
to his home in the nick of time, also by superhuman means. Horn is
warned to go back, in the ballads and in Horn Child, by the
discoloration of his ring, but gets home as he can; this part of the
story is slurred over in a way that indicates a purpose to avoid a
supernatural expedient.

Very prominent among the stories referred to is that of Henry of
Brunswick [Henry the Lion, Reinfrid of Brunswick], and this may well be
put first, because it is preserved in Scandinavian popular ballads.[165]

(1.) The latest of these, a Swedish ballad, from a collection made at
the end of the last century, 'Hertig Henrik,' Arwidsson, No 168, II,
422, represents Duke Henry as telling his wife that he is minded to go
off for seven years (he says not whither, but it is of course to the
East); should he stay eight or nine, she may marry the man she fancies.
He cuts a ring in two; gives her one half and keeps the other. He is
made captive, and serves a heathen lord and lady seven years, drawing
half the plough, "like another horse." His liberation is not accounted
for, but he was probably set free by his mistress, as in the ballad
which follows. He gets possession of an excellent sword, and uses it on
an elephant who is fighting with a lion. The grateful lion transports
the duke to his own country while he is asleep. A herdsman, of whom he
asks food, recommends him to go to the Brunswick mansion, where there is
a wedding, and Duke Henry's former spouse is the bride. When Henry comes
to the house, his daughter is standing without; he asks food for a poor
pilgrim. She replies that she has never heard of a pilgrim taking a lion
about with him. But they give him drink, and the bride, _pro more_,
drinks out of the same bowl, and finds the half ring in the bottom. The
bride feels in her pocket and finds her half,[166] and the two, when
thrown upon a table, run together and make one ring.

(2.) The Danish ballad[167] (Grundtvig, No 114, #B#, from a 17th century
manuscript), relates that Duke Henry, in consequence of a dream, took
leave of his wife, enjoining her to wait to the eighth year, and, if
then he did not return, marry whom she liked. In the course of his
fights with the heathen, Henry was made captive, and had to draw the
harrow and plough, like a beast. One day (during his lord's absence, as
we learn from #A#) the heathen lady whom he served set him free. He had
many adventures, and in one of them killed a panther who was pressing a
lion hard, for which service the lion followed him like a dog. The duke
then happened upon a hermit, who told him that his wife was to be
married the next day, but he was to go to sleep, and not be concerned.
He laid his head on a stone in the heathen land, and woke in a trice to
hear German speech from a herdsman's mouth. The herdsman confirmed what
the hermit had said: the duchess was to be married on the morrow. The
duke went to the kitchen as a pilgrim, and sent word to the lady that he
wished to drink to her. The duchess, surprised at this freedom, summoned
him into her presence. The verses are lost in which the cup should be
given the pilgrim and returned to the lady. When she drank off the wine
that was left, a half ring lay in the glass.

Danish #A#, though of the 16th century, does not mention the ring.

(3.) A Flemish broadside, which may originally have been of the 15th
century, relates the adventures of the Duke of Brunswick in sixty-five
stanzas of four long lines: reprinted in von der Hagen's Germania, VIII,
359, and Hoffmann's Niederl[:a]ndische Volkslieder, No 2, p. 6;
Coussemaker, No 47, p. 152; abridged and made over, in Willems, O. v.
L., p. 251, No 107. The duke, going to war, tells his wife to marry
again if he stays away seven years. She gives him half of her ring.
Seven years pass, and the duke, being then in desperate plight in a
wilderness, is taken off by a ship; by providential direction, no doubt,
though at first it does not so appear. For the fiend is aboard, who
tells him that his wife is to be married to-morrow, and offers, for his
soul, to carry him to his palace in his sleep before day. The duke,
relying on heaven and his lion, professes to accept the terms: he is to
be taken to his palace _in his sleep_. The lion rouses his master at the
right time, and the fiend is baffled. The duke goes to the marriage
feast, and sends a message to the bride that he desires a drink from her
in memory of her lord. They take him for a beggar, but the lady orders
him wine in a gold cup. The cup goes back to her with the duke's half
ring in it. She cries, "It is my husband!" joins her half to the one in
the cup, and the two adhere firmly.

(4.) A German poem of the 15th century, by Michel Wyssenhere, in
ninety-eight stanzas of seven lines, first printed by Massmann,
Denkm[ae]ler deutscher Sprache und Literatur, p. 122, and afterwards by
Erlach, II, 290, and elsewhere. The Lord of Brunswick receives an
impression in a dream that he ought to go to the Holy Sepulchre. He cuts
a ring in two, and gives his wife one half for a souvenir, but fixes no
time for his absence, and so naturally says nothing about her taking
another husband. He has the adventures which are usual in other versions
of the story, and at last finds himself among the Wild Hunt (das w[:o]den
her), and obliges one of the company, by conjurations, to tell him how
it is with his wife and children. The spirit informs him that his wife
is about to marry another man. He then constrains the spirit to
transport him and his lion to his castle. This is done on the same terms
as in the Flemish poem, and the lion wakes his master. His wife offers
him drink; he lets his half ring drop in the glass, and, upon the glass
being returned to the lady, she takes out the token, finds it like her
half, and cries out that she has recovered her dear husband and lord.

(5.) Henry the Lion, a chap-book printed in the 16th century, in one
hundred and four stanzas of eight short verses; reprinted in B[:u]sching's
Volkssagen, M[:a]rchen und Legenden, p. 213 ff, and (modernized) by
Simrock in the first volume of Die deutschen Volksb[:u]cher. The hero goes
out simply in quest of adventures, and, having lost his ship and all his
companions, is floating on a raft with his lion, when the devil comes to
him and tells him that his wife is to remarry. A compact is made, and
the devil balked, as before. Though we were not so informed at the
beginning, it now turns out that the duke had given a half ring to the
duchess seven years before, and had bidden her take a second husband if
he did not come back in that time. The duke sends a servant to beg a
drink of wine of his wife, and returns the cup, as in (3), (4).

(6.) A ballad in nine seven-line stanzas, supposed to be by a
Meistersinger, preserved in broadsides of about 1550 and 1603, B[:o]hme, No
5, p. 30, Erk's Wunderhorn, IV, 111. (7.) Hans Sachs's 'Historia,' 1562,
in two hundred and four verses, Works, ed. 1578, Buch iv, Theil ii,
Blatt lvii^b-lviii^b.[168] (8.) A Meistersingerlied of the end of the
16th century, in three twenty-line stanzas, printed in Idunna u. Hermode
for March 27, 1813 (appended to p. 64), and after this, with changes, in
Kretzschmer, II, 17, No 5.--These three agree with the foregoing as to
the ring.

(9.) Reinfrid von Braunschweig, c. 1300, ed. Bartsch, 1871. Reinfrid is
promised by the Virgin, who appears to him thrice in vision, that he
shall have issue if he will go over sea to fight the heathen. He breaks
a ring which his wife had given him, and gives her one half, vv.
14,906-11. If he dies, she is to marry, for public reasons, vv.
14,398-407; but she is not to believe a report of his death unless she
receives his half of the ring back, vv. 14,782-816, 15,040-049. The
latter part of the romance not being extant, we do not know the
conclusion, but a variation as to the use made of the ring is
probable.[169]

The story of Reinfrit is also preserved in a Bohemian prose chap-book
printed before 1565. This prose is clearly a poem broken up, and it is
believed that the original should be placed in the first half of the
14th century, or possibly at the end of the 13th. The hero returns, in
pilgrim's garb, after seven years' absence, to find his wife about to be
handed over by her father to another prince. He lets his ring fall into
a cup, and goes away; his wife recognizes the ring, and is reunited to
him. The story has passed from the Bohemian into Russian and Magyar.

XXIX, 83 ff, the ring at p. 92; XXXII, 322 ff.

Similar use is made of the ring in other German romances. (1.) 'Der edle
Moringer' (MS. of 14th century) asks his wife to wait seven years for
him, while he visits the land of St Thomas. He is warned by an angel, at
the expiration of that period, that he will lose her if he does not go
back, bewails himself to his patron, and is conveyed home in a sleep. He
begs an alms at his castle-gate in the name of God, St Thomas, and the
noble Moringer; is admitted to his wife's presence; sings a lay
describing his own case, which moves the lady much; throws into a beaker
of wine, which she sets before him, the ring by which she was married to
him, sends the cup back to her, and is recognized. B[:o]hme, No 6, p. 32;
Uhland, No 298, p. 773. (2.) In the older Hildebrandslied, which is of
the 14th century, or earlier, the hero, returning after an absence of
thirty-two years, drops his ring into a cup of wine presented to him by
his wife. B[:o]hme, No 1, p. 1; Uhland, No 132, p. 330. (3.) Wolfdietrich
drops Ortnit's ring into a cup of wine sent him by Liebgart, who has
been adjudged to the Graf von Biterne in consideration of his having, as
he pretended, slain the dragon. The cup is returned to the empress, the
ring identified, the pretension refuted, and Liebgart given to Ortnit's
avenger. Wolfdietrich B, ed. J[:a]nicke, I, 280 ff, stanzas 767-785. (4.)
King Rother (whose history has passages of the strongest resemblance to
Horn's), coming to retrieve his wife, who has been kidnapped and carried
back to her father, lands below Constantinople, at a woody and hilly
place, and assumes a pilgrim's disguise. On his way to the city he meets
a man who tells him that Ymelot of Babylon has invaded Greece, and taken
Constantin, his wife's father, prisoner; and that Constantin, to save
his life, has consented to give his daughter to the heathen king's son.
Rother steals into the hall, and even under the table at which the royal
party are sitting, and contrives to slip his ring into the hand of his
distressed young queen, who, thus assured of his presence, immediately
recovers her spirits. Massmann, Deutsche Gedichte des zw[oe]lften
Jahrhunderts, Theil ii, p. 213, vv. 3687-3878.

One of the best and oldest stories of the kind we are engaged with is
transmitted by C[ae]sarius of Heisterbach in his Dialogus Miraculorum, of
the first quarter of the 13th century. Gerard, a soldier living in
Holenbach ("his grandchildren are still alive, and there is hardly a man
in the town who does not know about this"), being, like Moringer,
devoted to St Thomas of India, was impelled to visit his shrine. He
broke a ring and gave one half to his wife, saying, Expect me back in
five years, and marry whom you wish if I do not come then. The journey,
which would be long enough any way, was providentially protracted. He
reached the shrine at last, and said his prayers, and then remembered
that that was the last day of his fifth year. Alas, my wife will marry
again, he thought; and quite right he was, for the wedding was even then
preparing. A devil, acting under the orders of St Thomas, set Gerard
down at his own door. He found his wife supping with her second partner,
and dropped his half ring into her cup. She took it out, fitted it to
the half which had been given her, rushed into his arms, and bade
good-by to the new bridegroom. Ed. Strange, II, 131.

A tradition closely resembling this has been found in Switzerland,
Gerard and St Thomas being exchanged for Wernhart von Str[:a]ttlingen and
St Michael. Menzel's Odin, p. 96.

Another of the most remarkable tales of this class is exquisitely told
by Boccaccio in the Decamerone, G. x, N. ix. Messer Torello, going to
the crusade, begs his wife to wait a year, a month, and a day before she
marries again. The lady assures him that she will never be another man's
wife; but he replies that a woman young, beautiful, and of high family,
as she is, will not be allowed to have her way. With her parting embrace
she gives him a ring from her finger, saying, If I die before I see you
again, remember me when you look on this. The Christians were wasted by
an excessive mortality, and those who escaped the ravages of disease
fell into the hands of Saladin, and were imprisoned by him in various
cities, Torello in Alexandria. Here he was recognized by Saladin, whom
he had entertained with the most delicate and splendid hospitality a few
months before, when the soldan was travelling through Italy in disguise.
Saladin's return for this courtesy was so magnificent as almost to put
Lombardy out of Torello's head,[170] and besides he trusted that his
wife had been informed of his safety by a letter which he had sent. This
was not so, however, and the death of another Torello was reported in
Italy as his, in consequence of which his supposed widow was solicited
in marriage, and was obliged to consent to take another husband after
the time should have expired which she had promised to wait. A week
before the last day, Torello learned that the ship which carried his
letter had been wrecked, and the thought that his wife would now marry
again drove him almost mad. Saladin extracted from him the cause of his
distress, and promised that he should yet be at home before the time was
out, which Torello, who had heard that such things had often been done,
was ready to believe. And in fact, by means of one of his necromancers,
Saladin caused Torello to be transported to Pavia in one night--the
night before the new nuptials. Torello appeared at the banquet the next
day in the guise of a Saracen, under the escort of an uncle of his, a
churchman, and at the right moment sent word to the lady that it was a
custom in his country for a bride to send her cup filled with wine to
any stranger who might be present, and for him to drink half and cover
the cup, and for her to drink the rest. To this the lady graciously
assented. Torello drank out most of the wine, dropped in the ring which
his wife had given him when they parted, and covered the cup. The lady,
upon lifting the cover, saw the ring, knew her husband, and, upsetting
the table in her ecstasy, threw herself into Torello's arms.

Tales of this description still maintain themselves in popular
tradition. 'Der Ring ehelicher Treue,' Gottschalk, Deutsche
Volksm[:a]rchen, II, 135, relates how Kuno von Falkenstein, going on a
crusade, breaks his ring and gives one half to his wife, begging her to
wait seven years before she marries again. He has the adventures of
Henry of Brunswick, with differences, and, like Moringer, sings a lay
describing his own case. The new bridegroom hands him a cup; he drops in
his half ring, and passes the cup to the bride. The two halves join of
themselves.[171] Other examples, not without variations and
deficiencies, in details, are afforded by 'Der getheilte Trauring,'
Schmitz, Sagen u. Legenden des Eifler Volkes, p. 82; 'Bodman,' Uhland,
in Pfeiffer's Germania, IV, 73-76; 'Graf Hubert von Kalw,' Meier,
Deutsche Sagen, u.s.w., aus Schwaben, p. 332, No 369, Grimms, Deutsche
Sagen, No 524; 'Der B[:a]renh[:a]uter,' Grimms, K.u.H. m[:a]rchen, No 101;
'Berthold von Neuhaus,' in Kern's Schlesische Sagen-Chronik, p. 93.

A story of the same kind is interwoven with an exceedingly impressive
adventure related of Richard Sans-Peur in Les Chroniques de Normandie,
Rouen, 1487, chap. lvii, cited in Michel, Chronique des Ducs de
Normandie par Benoit, II, 336 ff. A second is told of Guillaume Martel,
seigneur de Bacqueville; still others of a seigneur Gilbert de Lomblon,
a comrade of St. Louis in his first crusade. Am['e]lie de Bosquet, La
Normandie romanesque et merveilleuse, pp. 465-68, 470.

A Picard ballad, existing in two versions, partly cited by Rathery in
the Moniteur Universel for August 26, 1853, tells of a Sire de Cr['e]qui,
who, going beyond seas with, his sovereign, breaks his ring and gives
half to his young wife; is gone ten years, and made captive by the
Turks, who condemn him to death on account of his adhesion to Christ;
and is transported to his ch[^a]teau on the eve of the day of his doom.
This very day his wife is to take another husband, sorely against her
will. Cr['e]qui appears in the rags of a beggar, and legitimates himself by
producing his half of the ring (which, in a way not explained by
Rathery, has been brought back by a swan).

'Le Retour du Mari,' Puymaigre, Chants populaires messins, p. 20, has
also some traits of ballads of this class. A bridegroom has to go on a
campaign the very day of his nuptials. The campaign lasts seven years,
and the day of his return his wife is about to remarry. He is invited to
the wedding supper, and towards the close of it proposes to play cards
to see who shall have the bride. The guests are surprised. The soldier
says he will have the bride without winning her at cards or dice, and,
turning to the lady, asks, Where are the rings I gave you at your
wedding seven years ago? She will go for them; and here the story breaks
off.[172]

The same hard fortune is that of Costantino, a young Albanian, who is
called to the service of his king three days after his marriage. He
gives back her ring to his wife, and tells her he must go to the wars
for nine years. Should he not return in nine years and nine days, he
bids her marry. The young wife says nothing, waits her nine years and
nine days, and then, since she is much sought for, her father wishes her
to marry. She says nothing, again, and they prepare for the bridal.
Costantino, sleeping in the king's palace, has a bad dream, which makes
him heave a sigh that comes to his sovereign's ear. The king summons all
his soldiers, and inquires who heaved that sigh. Costantino confesses it
was he, and says it was because his wife was marrying. The king orders
him to take the swiftest horse and make for his home. Costantino meets
his father, and learns that his dream is true, presses on to the church,
arrives at the door at the same time as the bridal procession, and
offers himself for a bride's-man. When they come to the exchange of
rings, Costantino contrives that his ring shall remain on the bride's
finger. She knows the ring; her tears burst forth. Costantino declares
himself as having been already crowned with the lady.[173] Camarda,
Appendice al Saggio di Grammatologia, etc., 90-97, a Calabrian-Albanese
copy. There is a Sicilian, but incomplete, in Vigo, Canti popolari
siciliani, p. 342 ff, ed. 1857, p. 695 ff, ed. 1870-74.

With this belongs a ballad, very common in Greece, which, however, has
for the most part lost even more of what was in all probability the
original catastrophe. '[Gk: Anagn[^o]rismos],' Chasiotis, Popular Songs of
Epirus, p. 88, No 27, comes nearer the common story than other
versions.[174] A man who had been twelve years a slave after being a
bridegroom of three days, dreams that his wife is marrying, runs to the
cellar, and begins to sing dirges. The king hears, and is moved. "If it
is one of the servants, increase his pay; if a slave, set him free." The
slave tells his story (in three lines); the king bids him take a swift
gray. The slave asks the horses, which is a swift gray. Only one
answers, an old steed with forty wounds. "I am a swift gray; tie two or
three handkerchiefs around your head, and tie yourself to my back!"[175]
He comes upon his father pruning the vineyard. "Whose sheep are those
feeding in the meadows?" "My lost son's." He comes to his mother. "What
bride are they marrying?" "My lost son's." "Shall I get to them in
church while they are crowning?" "If you have a fast horse, you will
find them crowning; if you have a bad horse, you will find them at
table." He finds them at church, and calls out, A bad way ye have: why
do ye not bring out the bride, so that strangers may give her the cup? A
good way we have, they answer, we who bring out the bride, and strangers
give her the cup. Then he takes out his ring, while he is about to
present the cup to the bride. The bride can read; she stands and reads
(his name), and bids the company begone, for her mate has come, the
first crowned.

In other cases we find the hero in prison. He was put in for thirty
days; the keys are lost, and he stays thirty years. Legrand, p. 326, No
145; [Gk: Neoell[^e]nika Analekta], I, 85, No 19. More frequently he is
a galley slave: Zambelios, p. 678, No 103==Passow, No 448; Tommaseo,
III, 152==Passow, No 449; Sakellarios, [Gk: Kypriaka], III, 37, No 13:
[Gk: Neoell[^e]nika Analekta], I, 86, No 20; Jeannaraki, [Gk: Asmata
kr[^e]tika], p. 203, No 265. His bad dream [a letter from home] makes
him heave a sigh which shakes the prison, or stops [splits] the
galley.[176] In Tommaseo, III, 152, on reaching the church, he cries,
"Stand aside, gentlemen, stand aside, my masters; let the bride pour
for me." She pours him one cup and two, and exclaims (the ring which
was dropped into the cup having dropped out of the story), My John
has come back! Then they both "go out like candles." In Sakellarios
they embrace and fall dead, and when laid in the grave come up as a
cypress and a citron tree. In the Cretan ballad John does not dismount,
but takes the bride on to the horse and is off with her; so in the
beautiful ballad in Fauriel, II, 140, No 11, '[Gk: H[^E] HArpag[^e]],'
"peut-[^e]tre la plus distingu['e]e de ce recueil," which belongs with
this group, but seems to be later at the beginning and the end. Even
here the bride takes a cup to pour a draught for the horseman.

In Russia the ring story is told of Dobrynya and Nastasya. Dobrynya,
sent out shortly after his marriage to collect tribute for Vladimir,
requests Nastasya to wait for him twelve years: then she may wed again,
so it be not with Alesha. Twelve years pass. Alesha avows that he has
seen Dobrynya's corpse lying on the steppe, and sues for her hand.
Vladimir supports the suit, and Nastasya is constrained to accept this
prohibited husband. Dobrynya's horse [two doves, a pilgrim] reveals to
his master what is going on, and carries him home with marvellous speed.
Dobrynya gains admittance to the wedding-feast in the guise of a
merry-maker, and so pleases Vladimir with his singing that he is allowed
to sit where he likes. He places himself opposite Nastasya, drops his
ring in a cup, and asks her to drink to him. She finds the ring in the
bottom, falls at his feet and implores pardon.[177] Wollner, Volksepik
der Grossrussen, p. 122 f; Rambaud, La Russie ['E]pique, p. 86 f.

We have the ring employed somewhat after the fashion of these western
tales in Somadeva's story of Vid['u]shaka. The Vidy['u]dh['a]r['i]
Bhadr['a], having to part for a while with Vid['u]shaka, for whom she
had conceived a passion, gives him her ring. Subsequently, Vid['u]shaka
obliges a rakshas whom he has subdued to convey him to the foot of a
mountain on which Bhadr['a] had taken refuge. Many beautiful girls
come to fetch water in golden pitchers from a lake, and, on inquiring,
Vid['u]shaka finds that the water is for Bhadr['a]. One of the girls
asks him to lift her pitcher on to her shoulder, and while doing this
he drops into the pitcher Bhadr['a]'s ring. When the water is poured on
Bhadr['a]'s hands, the ring falls out. Bhadr['a] asks her maids if they
have seen a stranger. They say they have seen a mortal, and that he had
helped one of them with her pitcher. They are ordered to go for the
youth at once, for he is Bhadr['a]'s consort.[178]

According to the letter of the ballads, should the ring given Horn by
his lady turn wan or blue, this would signify that she loved another
man: but though accuracy would be very desirable in such a case, these
words are rather loose, since she never faltered in her love, and
submitted to marry another, so far as she submitted, only under
constraint. 'Horn Child,' sts 48, 71, agrees with the ballads as to this
point. We meet a ring of similar virtue in 'Bonny Bee-Hom,' Jamieson's
Popular Ballads, I, 187, and Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland,
I, 169.

    'But gin this ring should fade or fail,
      Or the stone should change its hue,
    Be sure your love is dead and gone,
      Or she has proved untrue.'

                              Jamieson, p. 191.

In the Roumanian ballad, 'Ring and Handkerchief,' a prince going to war
gives his wife a ring: if it should rust, he is dead. She gives him a
gold-embroidered handkerchief: if the gold melts, she is dead.
Alecsandri, Poesi[)i] pop. ale Rom[^a]nilor, p. 20, No 7; Stanley, Rouman
Anthology, p. 16, p. 193. In Gonzenbach's Sicilianische M[:a]rchen, I, 39,
No 7, a prince, on parting with his sister, gives her a ring, saying, So
long as the stone is clear, I am well: if it is dimmed, that is a sign
that I am dead. So No 5, at p. 23. A young man, in a Silesian story,
receives a ring from his sweetheart, with the assurance that he can
count upon her faith as long as the ring holds; and after twenty years'
detention in the mines of Siberia, is warned of trouble by the ring's
breaking: Goedsche, Schlesischer Sagen- Historien- u. Legendenschatz, I,
37, No 16. So in some copies of 'Lamkin,' the lord has a foreboding that
some ill has happened to his lady from the rings on his fingers bursting
in twain: Motherwell, p. 291, st. 23; Finlay, II, 47, st. 30.[179]

    In Scotland there was a babie born,
      Lill lal, etc.
    And his name it was called young Hind Horn.
      With a fal lal, etc.

    2
    He sent a letter to our king
    That he was in love with his daughter Jean.

    He's gien to her a silver wand,

    4
    She's gien to him a diamond ring,
    With seven bright diamonds set therein.

    5
    'When this ring grows pale and wan,
    You may know by it my love is gane.'

    6
    One day as he looked his ring upon,
    He saw the diamonds pale and wan.

    7
    He left the sea and came to land,
    And the first that he met was an old beggar man.

    8
    'What news, what news?' said young Hind Horn;
    'No news, no news,' said the old beggar man.

    9
    'No news,' said the beggar, 'no news at a',
    But there is a wedding in the king's ha.

    10
    'But there is a wedding in the king's ha,
    That has halden these forty days and twa.'

    11
    'Will ye lend me your begging coat?
    And I'll lend you my scarlet cloak.

    'Will you lend me your beggar's rung?
    And I'll gie you my steed to ride upon.

    The auld beggar man was bound for to ride,

    16
    When he came to the king's gate,
    He sought a drink for Hind Horn's sake.

    17
    The bride came down with a glass of wine,
    When he drank out the glass, and dropt in the ring.

    18
    'O got ye this by sea or land?
    Or got ye it off a dead man's hand?'

    19
    'I got not it by sea, I got it by land,
    And I got it, madam, out of your own hand.'

    There he met with a jovial beggar.

    9
    'What news, what news, old man?' he did say:
    'This is the king's young dochter's wedding day.'

    10
    'If this be true you tell to me,
    You must niffer clothes with me.

    11
    'You'll gie me your cloutit coat,
    I'll gie you my fine velvet coat.

    12
    'You'll gie me your cloutit pock,
    I'll gie you my purse; it'll be no joke.'

    13
    'Perhaps there['s] nothing in it, not one bawbee;'
    'Yes, there's gold and silver both,' said he.

    14
    'You'll gie me your bags of bread,
    And I'll gie you my milk-white steed.'

    15
    When they had niffered all, he said,
    'You maun learn me how I'll beg.'

    16
    'When you come before the gate,
    You'll ask for a drink for the highman's sake.'

    17
    When that he came before the gate,
    He calld for a drink for the highman's sake.

    18
    The bride cam tripping down the stair,
    To see whaten a bold beggar was there.

    19
    She gave him a drink with her own hand;
    He loot the ring drop in the can.

    20
    'Got ye this by sea or land?
    Or took ye't aff a dead man's hand?'

    21
    'I got na it by sea nor land,
    But I got it aff your own hand.'

    22
    The bridegroom cam tripping down the stair,
    But there was neither bride nor beggar there.

    23
    Her ain bridegroom had her first wed,
    But Young Hyn Horn had her first to bed.

    Seven long years he served the king,
    For the love of his daughter Jean.

    3
    He courted her through a wimble bore,
    The way never woman was courted before.

    4
    He gave her through a silver wand,
    With three singing laverocks there upon.

    5
    She gave him back a gay gold ring,
    With three bright diamonds glittering.

    'When this ring grows pale and blue,
    Fair Jeanie's love is lost to you.'

    Young Hynd Horn is gone to sea,
    And there seven long years staid he.

    When he lookd his ring upon,
    It grew pale and it grew wan.

    Young Hynd Horn is come to land,

    'Hynde Horn's bound love, and Hynde Horn's free,
    Whare was ye born, or in what countrie?'

    2
    'In gude greenwud whare I was born,
    And all my friends left me forlorn.

    3
    'I gave my love a silver wand;
    That was to rule oure all Scotland.

    4
    'My love gave me a gay gowd ring;
    That was to rule abune a' thing.'

    5
    'As lang as that ring keeps new in hue,
    Ye may ken that your love loves you.

    6
    'But whan that ring turns pale and wan,
    Ye may ken that your love loves anither man.'

    7
    He hoisted up his sails, and away sailed he,
    Till that he cam to a foreign countrie.

    8
    He looked at his ring; it was turnd pale and wan;
    He said, 'I wish I war at hame again.'

    9
    He hoisted up his sails, and hame sailed he,
    Until that he came to his ain countrie.

    10
    The first ane that he met wi
    Was wi a puir auld beggar man.

    11
    'What news, what news, my silly old man?
    What news hae ye got to tell to me?'

    12
    'Na news, na news,' the puir man did say,
    'But this is our queen's wedding day.'

    13
    'Ye'll lend me your begging weed,
    And I'll gie you my riding steed.'

    14
    'My begging weed is na for thee,
    Your riding steed is na for me.'

    'Which is the gate that ye used to gae?
    And what are the words ye beg wi?'

    17
    'Whan ye come to yon high hill,
    Ye'll draw your bent bow nigh until.

    18
    'Whan ye come to yonder town,
    Ye'll let your bent bow low fall down.

    19
    'Ye'll seek meat for St Peter, ask for St Paul,
    And seek for the sake of Hynde Horn all.

    20
    'But tak ye frae nane of them a',
    Till ye get frae the bonnie bride hersel O.'

    21
    Whan he cam to yon high hill,
    He drew his bent bow nigh until.

    22
    And whan he cam to yonder town,
    He lute his bent bow low fall down.

    23
    He saught meat for St Peter, he askd for St Paul,
    And he sought for the sake of Hynde Horn all.

    24
    But he would tak frae nane o them a',
    Till he got frae the bonnie bride hersel O.

    25
    The bride cam tripping doun the stair,
    Wi the scales o red gowd on her hair.

    26
    Wi a glass of red wine in her hand,
    To gie to the puir auld beggar man.

    27
    It's out he drank the glass o wine,
    And into the glass he dropt the ring.

    28
    'Got ye't by sea, or got ye't by land,
    Or got ye't aff a drownd man's hand?'

    29
    'I got na't by sea, I got na't by land,
    Nor got I it aff a drownd man's hand.

    30
    'But I got it at my wooing,
    And I'll gie it at your wedding.'

    31
    'I'll tak the scales o gowd frae my head,
    I'll follow you, and beg my bread.

    32
    'I'll tak the scales of gowd frae my hair,
    I'll follow you for evermair.'

    33
    She has tane the scales o gowd frae her head,
    She has followed him to beg her bread.

    34
    She has tane the scales o gowd frae her hair,
    And she has followed him for evermair.

    But atween the kitchen and the ha,
    There he lute his cloutie cloak fa.

    He hoist up sails and home came he,
    Home unto his ain countrie.

    12
    The first he met on his own land,
    It chancd to be a beggar man.

[159] This I should have missed but for the kindness of Mr W. Macmath.

[160] Motherwell's printed copy, Minstrelsy, p. 36, is thus made up:
stanzas 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, from Cromek (#D#); 4-7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19,
20, 24-28, 30-37, from #B#; 12, 17, 18 from #E#. 23 # #A# 14. 10, 21,
22, 29, have not been found in his manuscripts. The first line of the
burden is from #B#, the second from #E#. Motherwell alters his texts
slightly, now and then.

[161] #C# 16, 17 are corrupted, and also #F# 19, 23, #G# 21; all three
in a way which allows of easy emendation. Hymon [high, man] in #C#
should of course be Hyn Horn. The injunction in #G#, #H# should be to
ask nothing for Peter or Paul's sake, but all for Horn's.

[162] When Horn was near the city, he stopped to see how things would
go. King Modun passed, with Wikel, in gay discourse of the charms of
Rimild. Horn called out to them insultingly, and Modun asked who he was.
Horn said he had formerly served a man of consequence as his fisherman:
he had thrown a net almost seven years ago, and had now come to give it
a look. If it had taken any fish, he would love it no more; if it should
still be as he left it, he would carry it away. Modun thinks him a fool.
(3984-4057, and nearly the same in 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimild,'
77-79). This is part of a story in the Gesta Romanorum, of a soldier who
loved the emperor's daughter, and went to the holy land for seven years,
after a mutual exchange of fidelity for that time. A king comes to woo
the princess, but is put off for seven years, upon her alleging that she
has made a vow of virginity for so long. At the expiration of this term,
the king and the soldier meet as they are on the way to the princess.
The king, from certain passages between them, thinks the soldier a fool.
The soldier takes leave of the king under pretence of looking after a
net which he had laid in a certain place seven years before, rides on
ahead, and slips away with the princess. Gest. Rom., Oesterley, p. 597,
No 193; Gr[:a]sse, II, 159; Madden, p. 32; Swan, I, p. lxv. A similar story
in Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands, I, 281, 'Baillie Lunnain.'
(Simrock, Deutsche M[:a]rchen, No 47, is apparently a translation from the
Gesta.) The riddle of the hawk, slightly varied, is met with in the
romance of Blonde of Oxford and Jehan of Dammartin, v. 2811 ff, 3143 ff,
3288 ff (ed. Le Roux de Lincy, pp. 98, 109, 114), and, still further
modified, in Le Romant de Jehan de Paris, ed. Montaiglon, pp. 55, 63,
111. (Le Roux de Lincy, K[:o]hler, Mussafia, G. Paris). 'Horn et
Rimenhild,' it will be observed, has both riddles, and that of the net
is introduced under circumstances entirely like those in the Gesta
Romanorum. The French romance is certainly independent of the English in
this passage.

[163] See the excellent studies of King Horn by Wissmann, in Quellen und
Forschungen, No 16, and Anglia, IV, 342 ff.

[164] #A#, #B#, and #E#, which had not been printed at the time of his
writing, will convince Professor Stimming, whose valuable review in
Englische Studien, I, 351 ff, supplements, and in the matter of
_derivation_, I think, rectifies, Wissmann's Untersuchungen, that the
king's daughter in the ballads was faithful to Horn, and that they were
marrying her against her will, as in the romances. This contingency
seems not to have been foreseen when the ring was given: but it must be
admitted that it was better for the ring to change, to the temporary
clouding of the lady's character, than to have Horn stay away and the
forced marriage go on.

[165] See the ample introduction to 'Henrik af Brunsvig,' in Grundtvig,
No 114, II, 608 ff.

[166] It appears that these half rings are often dug up. "Neuere
Ausgrabungen haben vielfach auf solche Ringst[:u]cke gef[:u]hrt, die, als
Zeichen unverbr[:u]chlicher Treue, einst mit dem Geliebten gebrochen, ja
wie der Augenschein beweist, entzwei geschnitten, und so ins Grab
mitgenommen wurden, zum Zeichen dass die Liebe [:u]ber den Tod hinaus
daure." Rochholz, Schweizersagen aus dem Aargau, II, 116.

[167] Translated, with introduction of verses from #A#, by Prior,
Ancient Danish Ballads, II, 71.

[168] I have not seen this, and depend upon others here.

[169] G[:o]deke, 'Reinfr[^i]t von Braunschweig,' p. 89, conjectures
that the half ring was, or would have been, employed in the sequel by
some impostor (the story may never have been finished) as evidence
of Brunswick's death. A ring is so used in a Silesian tradition, of
the general character of that of Henry the Lion, with the difference
that the knight is awakened by a cock's crowing: 'Die Hahnkr[:a]he
bei Breslau,' in Kern's Schlesische Sagen-Chronik, p. 151. There is a
variation of this last, without the deception by means of the ring, in
Goedsche's Schlesischer Sagenschatz, p. 37, No 16.

[170] There are marked correspondences between Boccaccio's story and the
veritable history of Henry the Lion as given by Bartsch, Herzog Ernst,
cxxvi f: e. g., the presents of clothes by the empress (transferred to
Torello's wife), and the handsome behavior of two soldens, here
attributed to Saladin.

[171] Without the conclusion, also in Binder's Schw[:a]bische
Volkssagen, II, 173. These Volksm[:a]rchen, by the way, are
"erz[:a]hlt" by Gottschalk. It is not made quite so clear as could be
wished, whether they are merely re-told.

[172] Germaine's husband, after an absence of seven years, overcomes his
wife's doubts of his identity by exhibiting half of her ring, which
_happened_ to break the day of their wedding, or the day after:
Puymaigre, p. 11, Champfleury, Chansons des Provinces, p. 77. The
conclusion to Sir Tristrem, which Scott supplied, "abridged from the
French metrical romance, in the style of Tomas of Erceldoune," makes
Ganhardin lay a ring in a cup which Brengwain hands Ysonde, who
recognizes the ring as Tristrem's token. The cup was one of the presents
made to King Mark by Tristrem's envoy, and is transferred to Ysonde by
Scott. The passage has been cited as ancient and genuine.

[173] In the Greek rite, rings are used in the betrothal, which as a
rule immediately precedes the marriage. The rings are exchanged by the
priest and sponsors (Camarda says three times). Crowns, of vine twigs,
etc., are the emblems in the nuptial ceremony, and these are also
changed from one head to the other.

[174] I was guided to nearly all these Greek ballads by Professor
Liebrecht's notes, Zur Volkskunde, p. 207.

[175] This high-mettled horse is a capital figure in most of the
versions. In one of them the caution is given, "Do not feel safe in
spurring him: he will scatter thy brains ten ells below the ground." The
gray (otherwise the black) is of the same breed as the Russian
Dobrynya's, a little way on; or the foal that took Charles the Great,
under similar circumstances, from Passau to Aachen between morn and eve,
('Karl der Grosse,' from Enenkels Weltbuch, c. 1250, in von der Hagen's
Gesammtabenteuer, II, 619 ff); or the black in the poem and tale of
Thedel von Walmoden.

[176] In Jeannaraki the bey says, "My slave, give us a song, and I will
free you." John sings of his love, whom he was to lose that day. So
Zambelios, as above, Tommaseo, p. 152, and [Gk: Neo. Anal.] No. 20.
Compare Brunswick, in Wyssenhere, and Moringer.

[177] Otherwise: Nastasya waits _six_ years, as desired; is told that
Dobrynya is dead and is urged to marry Alesha; will not hear of marriage
for six years more; Vladimir then interposes. Dobrynya is furious, as
these absentees are sometimes pleased to be. He complains that women
have long hair and short wits, and so does Brunswick in Wyssenhere's
poem, st. 89. Numerous as are the instances of these long absences, the
woman is rarely, if ever, represented as in the least to blame. The
behavior of the man, on the other hand, is in some cases trying. Thus,
the Conde Dirlos tells his young wife to wait for him seven years, and
if he does not come in eight to marry the ninth. He accomplishes the
object of his expedition in three years, but stays fifteen, never
writes,--he had taken an unnecessary oath not to do that before he
started,--and forbids anybody else to write, on pain of death. Such is
his humor; but he is very much provoked at being reported dead. Wolf and
Hofmann, Primavera y Flor de Romances, II, 129, No 164.

Romania, VI, 359. Herr v. Bodman leaves his marriage ring in a
wash-bowl! Meier, Deutsche V. m. aus Schwaben, 214 f.

[179] The ring given Horn by Rymenbild, in 'King Horn,' 579 ff
(Wissmann), and in the French romance, 2056 ff, protects him against
material harm or mishap, or assures him superiority in fight, as long as
he is faithful. So in Buchan's version of 'Bonny Bee-Ho'm,' st. 8:

    'As lang's this ring's your body on,
      Your blood shall neer be drawn.'

"The king's daughter of Linne" gives her champion two rings, one of
which renders him invulnerable, and the other will staunch the blood of
any of his men who may be wounded: Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
Introduction, p. lvii. Eglamore's ring, Percy MS., II, 363, st. 51, will
preserve his life on water or land. A ring given Wolfdietrich by the
empress, #D# VIII, st. 42, ed. J[:a]nicke, doubles his strength and makes
him fire-proof in his fight with the dragon. The ring lent Ywaine by his
lady will keep him from prison, sickness, loss of blood, or being made
captive in battle, and give him superiority to all antagonists, so long
as he is true in love: Ritson, Met. Rom. I, 65, vv 1533 ff. But an
Indian ring which Reinfr[^i]t receives from his wife before he departs for
the crusade, 15,066 ff, has no equal, after all; for, besides doing as
much as the best of these, it imparts perpetual good spirits. It is
interesting to know that this matchless jewel had once been the property
of a Scottish king, and was given by him to his daughter when she was
sent to Norway to be married: under convoy of Sir Patrick Spens?

#B# can be traced in Banffshire, according to Christie, for more than a
hundred years, through the old woman that sang it, and her forbears. #C
a#, #D# were originally published by Allies in the year 1845, in a
pamphlet bearing the title The Jovial Hunter of Bromsgrove, Horne the
Hunter, and Robin Hood. No intimation as to the source of his copy, #C
b#, is given by Bell, i. e., Dixon. Apparently all the variations from
Allies, #C a#, are of the nature of editorial improvements. #E a# is
said (1857) to be current in the north of England as a nursery song.

One half of #A#, the oldest and fullest copy of this ballad (the second
and fourth quarters), is wanting in the Percy MS. What we can gather of
the story is this. A knight finds a lady sitting in a tree, #A#, #C#,
#D# [under a tree, #E#], who tells him that a wild boar has slain Sir
Broning, #A# [killed her lord and thirty of his men, #C#; worried her
lord and wounded thirty, #E#]. The knight kills the boar, #B-D#, and
seems to have received bad wounds in the process, #A#, #B#; the boar
belonged to a giant, #B#; or a wild woman, #C#, #D#. The knight is
required to forfeit his hawks and leash, and the little finger of his
right hand, #A# [his horse, his hound, and his lady, #C#]. He refuses to
submit to such disgrace, though in no condition to resist, #A#; the
giant allows him time to heal his wounds, forty days, #A#; thirty-three,
#B#; and he is to leave his lady as security for his return, #A#. At the
end of this time the knight comes back sound and well, #A#, #B#, and
kills the giant as he had killed the boar, #B#. #C# and #D# say nothing
of the knight having been wounded. The wild woman, to revenge her
"pretty spotted pig," flies fiercely at him, and he cleaves her in two.
The last quarter of the Percy copy would, no doubt, reveal what became
of the lady who was sitting in the tree, as to which the traditional
copies give no light.

Our ballad has much in common with the romance of 'Sir Eglamour of
Artois,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, II, 338; Thornton Romances,
Camden Society, ed. Halliwell, p. 121; Ellis, Metrical Romances, from an
early printed copy, Bohn's ed., p. 527. Eglamour, simple knight, loving
Christabel, an earl's daughter, is required by the father, who does not
wish him well, to do three deeds of arms, the second being to kill a
boar in the kingdom of Sattin or Sydon, which had been known to slay
forty armed knights in one day (Percy, st. 37). This Eglamour does,
after a very severe fight. The boar belonged to a giant, who had kept
him fifteen years to slay Christian men (Thornton, st. 42, Percy, 40).
This giant had demanded the king of Sydon's daughter's hand, and comes
to carry her off, by force, if necessary, the day following the
boar-fight. Eglamour, who had been found by the king in the forest, in a
state of exhaustion, after a contest which had lasted to the third or
fourth day, and had been taken home by him and kindly cared for, is now
ready for action again. He goes to the castle walls with a squire, who
carries the boar's head on a spear. The giant, seeing the head,
exclaims,

    'Alas, art thou dead!
      My trust was all in thee!
    Now by the law that I lieve in,
    My little speckled hoglin,
      Dear bought shall thy death be.'

                              Percy, st. 44.

Eglamour kills the giant, and returns to Artois with both heads. The
earl has another adventure ready for him, and hopes the third chance may
quit all. Eglamour asks for twelve weeks to rest his weary body.

#B# comes nearest the romance, and possibly even the wood of Tore is a
reminiscence of Artois. The colloquy with the giant in #B# is also,
perhaps, suggested by one which had previously taken place between
Eglamour and another giant, brother of this, after the knight had killed
one of his harts (Percy, st. 25). #C# 11, #D# 9 strikingly resemble the
passage of the romance cited above (Percy, 44, Thornton, 47).

The ballad has also taken up something from the romance of 'Eger and
Grime,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, I, 341; Laing, Early Metrical
Tales, p. 1; 'Sir Eger, Sir Grahame, and Sir Gray-Steel,' Ellis's
Specimens, p. 546. Sir Egrabell (Rackabello, Isaac-a-Bell), Lionel's
father, recalls Sir Eger, and Hugh the Gr[ae]me in #B# is of course the
Grahame or Grime of the romance, the Hugh being derived from a later
ballad. Gray-Steel, a man of proof, although not quite a giant, cuts off
the little finger of Eger's right hand, as the giant proposes to do to
Lionel in #A# 21.

The friar in #E# 1^3, 4^1, may be a corruption of Ryalas, or some like
name, as the first line of the burden of #E#, 'Wind well, _Lion_, good
hunter,' seems to be a perversion of 'Wind well _thy horn_, good
hunter,' in #C#, #D#.[180] This part of the burden, especially as it
occurs in #A#, is found, nearly, in a fragment of a song of the time of
Henry VIII, given by Mr Chappell in his Popular Music of the Olden Time,
I, 58, as copied from "MSS Reg., Append. 58."

    'Blow thy horne, hunter,
      Cum, blow thy horne on hye!
    In yonder wode there lyeth a doo,
      In fayth she woll not dye.
    Cum, blow thy horne, hunter,
    Cum, blow thy horne, joly hunter!'

A terrible swine is a somewhat favorite figure in romantic tales. A
worthy peer of the boar of Sydon is killed by King Arthur in 'The
Avowynge of King Arthur,' etc., Robson, Three Early English Metrical
Romances (see st. xii). But both of these, and even the Erymanthian,
must lower their bristles before the boar in 'Kilhwch and Olwen,'
Mabinogion, Part iv, pp. 309-16. Compared with any of these, the "felon
sow" presented by Ralph Rokeby to the friars of Richmond (Evans, Old
Ballads, II, 270, ed. 1810, Scott, Appendix to Rokeby, note M) is a tame
villatic pig: the old mettle is bred out.

Professor Grundtvig has communicated to me a curious Danish ballad of
this class, 'Limgrises Vise,' from a manuscript of the latter part of
the 16th century. A very intractable damsel, after rejecting a multitude
of aspirants, at last marries, with the boast that her progeny shall be
fairer than Christ in heaven. She has a litter of nine pups, a pig, and
a boy. The pig grows to be a monster, and a scourge to the whole region.

    He drank up the water from dike and from dam,
    And ate up, besides, both goose, gris and lamb.

The beast is at last disposed of by baiting him with the nine
congenerate dogs, who jump down his throat, rend liver and lights, and
find their death there, too. This ballad smacks of the broadside, and is
assigned to the 16th century. A fragment of a Swedish swine-ballad, in
the popular tone, is given by Dybeck, Runa, 1845, p. 23; another, very
similar, in Axelson's Vesterdalarne, p. 179, 'Koloregris,' and Professor
Sophus Bugge has recovered some Norwegian verses. The Danish story of
the monstrous birth of the pig has become localized: the Liimfiord is
related to have been made by the grubbing of the Limgris: Thiele,
Danmarks Folkesagn, II. 19, two forms.

There can hardly be anything but the name in common between the Lionel
of this ballad and Lancelot's cousin-german.

    And as he rode still on the plaine,
    He saw a lady sitt in a graine.

    She said, 'I will sitt in this tree

    'Tell me, lady, and doe not misse,

    How he might that wilde bore beguile.

    18
    'S_i_r Egrabell,' he said, 'my father was;

    [Then he put his horn unto his mouth],
    Then he blowd a blast full north, east, west and south.
      As he was, etc.

    6
    And the wild boar heard him full into his den;
    Then he made the best of his speed unto him.
      To Sir Ryalas, etc.

    7
    Then the wild boar, being so stout and so strong,
    He thrashd down the trees as he came along.
      To Sir Ryalas, etc.

    8
    'O what dost thou want of me?' the wild boar said he;
    'O I think in my heart I can do enough for thee.'
      For I am, etc.

    9
    Then they fought four hours in a long summer's day,
    Till the wild boar fain would have gotten away.
      From Sir Ryalas, etc.

    10
    Then Sir Ryalas drawd his broad sword with might,
    And he fairly cut his head off quite.
      For he was, etc.

    11
    Then out of the wood the wild woman flew:
    'Oh thou hast killed my pretty spotted pig!
      As thou beest, etc.

    12
    'There are three things I do demand of thee,
    It's thy horn, and thy hound, and thy gay lady.'
      As thou beest, etc.

    13
    'If these three things thou dost demand of me,
    It's just as my sword and thy neck can agree.'
      For I am, etc.

    14
    Then into his locks the wild woman flew,
    Till she thought in her heart she had torn him through.
      As he was, etc.

    15
    Then Sir Ryalas drawd his broad sword again,
    And he fairly split her head in twain.
      For he was, etc.

    16
    In Bromsgrove church they both do lie;
    There the wild boar's head is picturd by
      Sir Ryalas, etc.

KING ORFEO

        The Leisure Hour, February 14, 1880, No 1468: Folk-Lore
        from Unst, Shetland, by Mrs Saxby, p. 109.


Mr Edmondston, from whose memory this ballad was derived, notes that
though stanzas are probably lost after the first which would give some
account of the king in the east wooing the lady in the west, no such
verses were sung to him. He had forgotten some stanzas after the fourth,
of which the substance was that the lady was carried off by fairies;
that the king went in quest of her, and one day saw a company passing
along a hill-side, among whom he recognized his lost wife. The troop
went to what seemed a great "ha-house," or castle, on the hillside.
Stanzas after the eighth were also forgotten, the purport being that a
messenger from behind the grey stane appeared and invited the king in.

We have here in traditional song the story of the justly admired
medi[ae]val romance of Orpheus, in which fairy-land supplants Tartarus,
faithful love is rewarded, and Eurydice (Heurodis, Erodys, Eroudys) is
retrieved. This tale has come down to us in three versions: #A#, in the
Auchinleck MS., dating from the beginning of the fourteenth century,
Advocates Library, Edinburgh, printed in Laing's Select Remains of the
Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland, 'Orfeo and Heurodis,' No 3; #B#,
Ashmole MS., 61, Bodleian Library, of the first half of the fifteenth
century, printed in Halliwell's Illustrations of Fairy Mythology, 'Kyng
Orfew,' p. 37; #C#, Harleian MS., 3810, British Museum, printed by
Ritson, Metrical Romanc[:e]es, II, 248, 'Sir Orpheo.' At the end of the
Auchinleck copy we are told that harpers in Britain heard this marvel,
and made a lay thereof, which they called, after the king, 'Lay Orfeo.'
The other two copies also, but in verses which are a repetition of the
introduction to 'Lay le Freine,' call this a Breton lay.

The story is this (#A#). Orfeo was a king [and so good a harper never
none was, #B#]. One day in May his queen went out to a garden with two
maidens, and fell asleep under an "ympe" tree. When she waked she
shrieked, tore her clothes, and acted very wildly. Her maidens ran to
the palace and called for help, for the queen would go mad. Knights and
ladies went to the queen, took her away, and put her to bed; but still
the excitement continued. The king, in great affliction, besought her to
tell him what was the matter, and what he could do. Alas! she said, I
have loved thee as my life, and thou me, but now we must part. As she
slept knights had come to her and had bidden her come speak with their
king. Upon her refusal, the king himself came, with a company of knights
and damsels, all on snow-white steeds, and made her ride on a palfrey by
his side, and, after he had shown her his palace, brought her back and
said: Look thou be under this ympe tree tomorrow, to go with us; and if
thou makest us any let, we will take thee by force, wherever thou be.
The next day Orfeo took the queen to the tree under guard of a thousand
knights, all resolved to die before they would give her up: but she was
spirited away right from the midst of them, no one knew whither.

The king all but died of grief, but it was no boot. He gave his kingdom
in charge to his high steward, told his barons to choose a new king when
they should learn that he was dead, put on a sclavin and nothing else,
took his harp, and went barefoot out at the gate. Ten years he lived in
the woods and on the heath; his body wasted away, his beard grew to his
girdle. His only solace was in his harp, and, when the weather was
bright, he would play, and all the beasts and birds would flock to him.
Often at hot noon-day he would see the king of fairy hunting with his
rout, or an armed host would go by him with banners displayed, or
knights and ladies would come dancing; but whither they went he could
not tell. One day he descried sixty ladies who were hawking. He went
towards them and saw that one of them was Heurodis. He looked at her
wistfully, and she at him; neither spoke a word, but tears fell from her
eyes, and the ladies hurried her away. He followed, and spared neither
stub nor stem. They went in at a rock, and he after. They alighted at a
superb castle; he knocked at the gate, told the porter he was a
minstrel, and was let in. There he saw Heurodis, sleeping under an ympe
tree.

Orfeo went into the hall, and saw a king and queen, sitting in a
tabernacle. He kneeled down before the king. What man art thou? said the
king. I never sent for thee, and never found I man so bold as to come
here unbidden. Lord, quoth Orfeo, I am but a poor minstrel, and it is a
way of ours to seek many a lord's house, though we be not welcome.
Without more words he took his harp and began to play. All the palace
came to listen, and lay down at his feet. The king sat still and was
glad to hear, and, when the harping was done, said, Minstrel, ask of me
whatever it be; I will pay thee largely. "Sir," said Orfeo, "I beseech
thee give me the lady that sleepeth under the ympe tree." "Nay," quoth
the king, "ye were a sorry couple; for thou art lean and rough and
black, and she is lovely and has no lack. A lothly thing were it to see
her in thy company." "Gentle king," replied the harper, it were a fouler
thing to hear a lie from thy mouth." "Take her, then, and be blithe of
her," said the king.

Orfeo now turned homewards, but first presented himself to the steward
alone, and in beggar's clothes, as a harper from heathendom, to see if
he were a true man. The loyal steward was ready to welcome every good
harper for love of his lord. King Orfeo made himself known; the steward
threw over the table, and fell down at his feet, and so did all the
lords. They brought the queen to the town. Orfeo and Heurodis were
crowned anew, and lived long afterward.

The Scandinavian burden was, perhaps, no more intelligible to the singer
than "Hey non nonny" is to us. The first line seems to be Unst for
Danish

    Skoven [oa]rle gr[:o]n (Early green's the wood).

The sense of the other line is not so obvious. Professor Grundtvig has
suggested to me,

    Hvor hjorten han g[oa]r [oa]rlig (Where the hart goes yearly).

        #M.# From Miss M. Reburn, as learned in County Meath,
        Ireland, one stanza.


Two fragments of this ballad, #A#, #B#, were printed in the last quarter
of the eighteenth century; #C-L# were committed to writing after 1800;
and, of these, #E#, #H#, #J#, #K# are now printed for the first time.

#A-H# differ only slightly, but several of these versions are very
imperfect. A young woman, who passes for a leal maiden, gives birth to
two babes [#A#, #B#, one, #H#, three], puts them to death with a
penknife, #B-F#, and buries them, or, #H#, ties them hand and feet and
buries them alive. She afterwards sees two pretty boys, and exclaims
that if they were hers she would treat them most tenderly. They make
answer that when they were hers they were very differently treated,
rehearse what she had done, and inform or threaten her that hell shall
be her portion, #C#, #D#, #E#, #F#, #H#. In #I# the children are buried
alive, as in #H#, in #J a# strangled, in #J b# and #L# killed with the
penknife, but the story is the same down to the termination, where,
instead of simple hell-fire, there are various seven-year penances,
properly belonging to the ballad of 'The Maid and the Palmer,' which
follows this.

All the English ballads are in two-line stanzas.[181]

Until 1870 no corresponding ballad had been found in Denmark, though
none was more likely to occur in #Danish#. That year Kristensen, in the
course of his very remarkable ballad-quest in Jutland, recovered two
versions which approach surprisingly near to Scottish tradition, and
especially to #E#: Jydske Folkeviser, I, 329, No 121 #A#, #B#,
'Barnemordersken.' Two other Danish versions have been obtained since
then, but have not been published. #A# and #B# are much the same, and a
close translation of #A# will not take much more space than would be
required for a sufficient abstract.

    Little Kirsten took with her the bower-women five,
    And with them she went to the wood belive.

    She spread her cloak down on the earth,
    And on it to two little twins gave birth.

    She laid them under a turf so green,
    Nor suffered for them a sorrow unseen.

    She laid them under so broad a stone,
    Suffered sorrow nor harm for what she had done.

    Eight years it was, and the children twain
    Would fain go home to their mother again.

    They went and before Our Lord they stood:
    'Might we go home to our mother, we would.'

    'Ye may go to your mother, if ye will,
    But ye may not contrive any ill.'

    They knocked at the door, they made no din:
    'Rise up, our mother, and let us in.'

    By life and by death hath she cursed and sworn,
    That never a child in the world had she borne.

    'Stop, stop, dear mother, and swear not so fast,
    We shall recount to you what has passed.

    'You took with you the bower-women five,
    And with them went to the wood belive.

    'You spread your cloak down on the earth,
    And on it to two little twins gave birth.

    'You laid us under a turf so green,
    Nor suffered for us a sorrow unseen.

    'You laid us under so broad a stone,
    Suffered sorrow nor harm for what you had done.'

    'Nay my dear bairns, but stay with me;
    And four barrels of gold shall be your fee.'

    'You may give us four, or five, if you choose,
    But not for all that, heaven will we lose.

    'You may give us eight, you may give us nine,
    But not for all these, heaven will we tine.

    'Our seat is made ready in heavenly light,
    But for you a seat in hell is dight.'

A ballad is spread all over #Germany# which is probably a variation of
'The Cruel Mother,' though the resemblance is rather in the general
character than in the details. #A#, 'H[:o]llisches Recht,' Wunderhorn,
II, 202, ed. of 1808, II, 205, ed. 1857. Mittler, No 489, p. 383, seems
to be this regulated and filled out. #B#, Erlach, 'Die Rabenmutter,'
IV, 148; repeated, with the addition of one stanza, by Zuccalmaglio,
p. 203, No 97. #C#, 'Die Kindsm[:o]rderinn,' Meinert, p. 164, from
the Kuhl[:a]ndchen; turned into current German, Erk's Liederhort,
p. 144, No 41^c. #D#, Simrock, p. 87, No 37^a, from the Aargau.

The story is nearly this in all. A herdsman, passing through a wood,
hears the cry of a child, but cannot make out whence the sound comes.
The child announces that it is hidden in a hollow tree, and asks to be
taken to the house where its mother is to be married that day. There
arrived, the child proclaims before all the company that the bride is
its mother. The bride, or some one of the party, calls attention to the
fact that she is still wearing her maiden-wreath. Nevertheless, says the
child, she has had three children: one she drowned, one she buried in a
dung-heap [the sand], and one she hid in a hollow tree. The bride wishes
that the devil may come for her if this is true, and, upon the word,
Satan appears and takes her off; in #B#, #G#, #J#, with words like
these:

    'Komm her, komm her, meine sch[:o]nste Braut,
    Dein Sessel ist dir in der H[:o]lle gebaut.' #J# 9.

A #Wendish# version, 'Der H[:o]llentanz,' in Haupt and Schmaler, I, 290, No
292, differs from the German ballads only in this, that the bride has
already borne nine children, and is going with the tenth.

A combination of #B#, #C#, #D#, #F# is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske
og skotske Folkeviser, No 43, p. 279, and #I#, from the eighth stanza
on, p. 282. #C# is translated by Wolff, Halle der V[:o]lker, I, 11, and
Hauschatz, p. 223; Allingham's version (nearly #B a#) by Knortz, L. u.

[181] All the genuine ones. 'Lady Anne,' in Scott's Minstrelsy, III,
259, 1803, is on the face of it a modern composition, with extensive
variations, on the theme of the popular ballad. It is here given in an
Appendix, with a companion piece from Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and
Galloway Song.


APPENDIX

LADY ANNE

"This ballad was communicated to me by Mr Kirkpatrick Sharpe of Hoddom,
who mentions having copied it from an old magazine. Although it has
probably received some modern corrections, the general turn seems to be
ancient, and corresponds with that of a fragment [#B b#], which I have
often heard sung in my childhood." Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,
III, 259, ed. 1803.

Buchan, Gleanings, p. 90, has an additional stanza between 8 and 9 of
Scott's, whether from the old magazine or not, it would not be worth the
while to ascertain.

Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, I, 339, has rewritten even 'Lady Anne.'

Translated by Schubart, p. 170, and by Gerhard, p. 92.

    1
    Fair Lady Anne sate in her bower,
      Down by the greenwood side,
    And the flowers did spring, and the birds did sing,
      'Twas the pleasant May-day tide.

    2
    But fair Lady Anne on Sir William calld,
      With the tear grit in her ee,
    'O though them be fause, may Heaven thee guard,
      In the wars ayont the sea!'

    3
    Out of the wood came three bonnie boys,
      Upon the simmer's morn,
    And they did sing and play at the ba',
      As naked as they were born.

    4
    'O seven lang years wad I sit here,
      Amang the frost and snaw,
    A' to hae but ane o these bonnie boys,
      A playing at the ba.'

    5
    Then up and spake the eldest boy,
      'Now listen, thou fair ladie,
    And ponder well the rede that I tell,
      Then make ye a choice of the three.

    6
    ''Tis I am Peter, and this is Paul,
      And that ane, sae fair to see,
    But a twelve-month sinsyne to paradise came,
      To join with our companie.'

    7
    'O I will hae the snaw-white boy,
      The bonniest of the three:'
    'And if I were thine, and in thy propine,
      O what wad ye do to me?'

    8
    ''Tis I wad clead thee in silk and gowd,
      And nourice thee on my knee:'
    'O mither, mither, when I was thine,
      Sic kindness I couldna see.

    9
    'Beneath the turf, where now I stand,
      The fause nurse buried me;
    The cruel pen-knife sticks still in my heart,
      And I come not back to thee.'

       *       *       *       *       *

"There are many variations of this affecting tale. One of them appears
in the Musical Museum, and is there called 'Fine Flowers of the Valley,'
of which the present is either the original or a parallel song. I am
inclined to think it is the original." Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and
Galloway Song, p. 267.

    4

    And washed her hands wi mony a tear.

    5
    And as she kneelt to her God in prayer,
    The sweet wee babe was smiling there.

    'O ay, my God, as I look to thee,
    My babe 's atween my God and me.

    7

        IV, 96.

        #B.# Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. Laing, p. 157.


The only English copy of this ballad that approaches completeness is
furnished by the Percy manuscript, #A#. Sir Walter Scott remembered, and
communicated to Kirkpatrick Sharpe, three stanzas, and half of the
burden, of another version, #B#.

There are three versions in #Danish#, no one of them very well
preserved. #A#,'Maria Magdalena,' is a broadside of about 1700, existing
in two identical editions: Grundtvig, No 98, II, 530; #B#, _ib._, was
written down in the F[:a]r[:o]e isles in 1848, by Hammershaimb; #C# was
obtained from recitation by Kristensen in Jutland in 1869, Jydske
Folkeviser, I, 197, No 72, 'Synderinden.'

A #F[:a]r[:o]e# version, from the end of the last century or the
beginning of this, is given in Grundtvig's notes, p. 533 ff.

Versions recently obtained from recitation in #Norway# are: 'Maria,'
Bugge's Gamle Norske Folkeviser, No 18; #A#, p. 88; #B#, p. 90, a
fragment, which has since been completed, but only two more stanzas
printed, Grundtvig, III, 889; #C#, Bugge, p. 91. #D#, #E# are reported,
but only a stanza or two printed, Grundtvig, III, 889f; #F#, printed 890
f, and #G#, as obtained by Lindeman, 891: all these, #D-G#, communicated
by Bugge. #C#, and one or two others, are rather Danish than Norwegian.

This is, according to Afzelius, one of the commonest of #Swedish#
ballads. These versions are known: #A#, "a broadside of 1798 and 1802,"
Grundtvig, II, 531, Bergstr[:o]m's Afzelius, I, 335; #B#, 'Magdalena,'
Atterbom's Poetisk Kalender for 1816, p. 20; #C#, Afzelius, II, 229;
#D#, Arwidsson, I, 377, No 60; #E#, Dybeck's Svenska Visor, H[:a]fte 2, No
6, only two stanzas; #F#, #G#, "in Wiede's collection, in the Swedish
Historical and Antiquarian Academy;" #H#, "in Cavallius and Stephens'
collection, where also #A#, #F#, #G# are found;" #I#, Maximilian
Axelson's Vesterdalarne, p. 171; #J#, 'Jungfru Adelin,' E. Wigstr[:o]m's
Folkdiktning, No 38, p. 76; #K#, 'Jungfru Maja,' Album utgifvet af
Nyl[:a]ndingar, VI, 227. #A-F# are printed in Grundtvig's notes, II, 533
ff, and also some verses of #G#, #H#.

The ballad is known to have existed in #Icelandic# from a minute of Arne
Magnusson, who cites the line, "Swear not, swear not, wretched woman,"
but it has not been recovered (Grundtvig, III, 891, note d).

#Finnish#, 'Mataleenan vesimatka,' Kanteletar, ed. 1864, p. 240.

The story of the woman of Samaria, John, iv, is in all these blended
with medi[ae]val traditions concerning Mary Magdalen, who is assumed to be
the same with the woman "which was a sinner," in Luke, vii, 37, and also
with Mary, sister of Lazarus. This is the view of the larger part of the
Latin ecclesiastical writers, while most of the Greeks distinguish the
three (Butler, 'Lives of the Saints,' VII, 290, note). It was reserved
for ballads, as Grundtvig remarks, to confound the Magdalen with the
Samaritan woman.

The traditional Mary Magdalen was a beautiful woman of royal descent,
who derived her surname from Magdalum, her portion of the great family
estate. For some of her earlier years entirely given over to carnal
delights, "unde jam, proprio nomine perdito, peccatrix consueverat
appellari," she was, by the preaching of Jesus, converted to a
passionate repentance and devotedness. In the course of the persecution
of the church at Jerusalem, when Stephen was slain and the Christians
widely dispersed, Mary, with Lazarus, her brother, Martha, and many
more, were set afloat on the Mediterranean in a rudderless ship, with
the expectation that they would find a watery grave. But the malice of
the unbelieving was overruled, and the vessel came safe into port at
Marseilles. Having labored some time for the christianizing of the
people, and founded churches and bishoprics, Mary retired to a solitude
where there was neither water, tree, nor plant, and passed the last
thirty years of her life in heavenly contemplation. The cave in which
she secluded herself is still shown at La Sainte Baume. The absence of
material comforts was, in her case, not so great a deprivation, since
every day at the canonical hours she was carried by angels to the skies,
and heard, with ears of the flesh, the performances of the heavenly
choirs, whereby she was so thoroughly refected that when the angels
restored her to her cave she was in need of no bodily aliment. (Golden
Legend, Gr[ae]sse, c. 96.) It is the practical Martha that performs real
austerities, and those which are ascribed to her correspond too closely
with the penance in the Scandinavian ballads not to be the original of
it: "Nam in primis _septem_ annis, glandibus et radicibus herbisque
crudis et _pomis_[182] silvestribus corpusculum sustentans potius quam
reficiens, victitavit.... Extensis solo ramis arboreis aut viteis,
lapide pro cervicali capiti superposito subjecto, ... incumbebat."
(Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. Hist., ix, 100.)

The best-preserved Scandinavian ballads concur nearly in this account. A
woman at a well, or a stream, is approached by Jesus, who asks for
drink. She says she has no vessel to serve him with. He replies that if
she were pure, he would drink from her hands. She protests innocence
with oaths, but is silenced by his telling her that she has had three
children, one with her father, one with her brother, one with her parish
priest: Danish #A#, #B#, #C#; F[:a]r[:o]e; Swedish #C#, #D#, #F#, #I#, #J#,
#K#; Norwegian #A#, #C#, #F#, #G#. She falls at his feet, and begs him
to shrive her. Jesus appoints her a seven years' penance in the wood.
Her food shall be the buds or the leaves of the tree [grass, worts,
berries, bark], her drink the dew [brook, juice of plants], her bed the
hard ground [linden-roots, thorns and prickles, rocks, straw and
sticks]; all the while she shall be harassed by bears and lions
[wolves], or snakes and drakes (this last in Swedish #B#, #C#, #D#, #I#,
#K#, Norwegian #A#). The time expired, Jesus returns and asks how she
has liked her penance. She answers, as if she had eaten daintily, drunk
wine, slept on silk or swan's-down, and had angelic company [had been
listening to music].[183] Jesus then tells her that a place is ready for
her in heaven.

The penance lasts eight years in Swedish #C#, #F#, #J#, Norwegian #A#;
nine in the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad; fifteen in Danish #B#; and six weeks
in Danish #C#. It is to range the field in Danish #A#, Swedish #F#; to
walk the snows barefoot in the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad and Norwegian #B#;
in Norwegian #D# to stand nine years in a rough stream and eight years
naked in the church-paths.

The names Maria, or Magdalena, Jesus, or Christ, are found in most of
the Scandinavian ballads. Swedish #E# has 'Lena (Lilla Lena); Swedish
#H# He-lena; #J#, Adelin; #K#, Maja. Norwegian #A# gives no name to the
woman, and Danish #A# a name only in the burden; Norwegian #B# has,
corruptly, Margjit. In Danish #C#, Norwegian #B#, #G#, Jesus is called
an _old_ man, correspondingly with the "old palmer" of English #A#, but
the old man is afterwards called Jesus in Norwegian #G# (#B# is not
printed in full), and in the burden of Danish #C#. The Son is exchanged
for the Father in Swedish #D#.

Stanzas 4, 5 of Swedish #A#, #G#, approach singularly near to English
#A# 6, 7:

Swedish #A#:

    4
    'Would thy leman now but come,
    Thou wouldst give him to drink out of thy hand.'

    5
    By all the worlds Magdalen swore,
    That leman she never had.

Swedish #G#:

    4
    'Yes, but if I thy leman were,
    I should get drink from thy snow-white hand.'

    5
    Maria swore by the Holy Ghost,
    She neer had to do with any man.

The woman is said to have taken the lives of her three children in
Danish #A#, #B#, #C#, and of two in Swedish #C#, #D#, #F#, #I#, #J#, #K#
(#B# also, where there are but two in all), a trait probably borrowed
from 'The Cruel Mother.'

The seven years' penance of the Scandinavian ballads is multiplied three
times in English #A#, and four times in #B# and in those versions of
'The Cruel Mother' which have been affected by the present ballad (20,
#I#, #J#, #K#; #L# is defective). What is more important, the penance in
the English ballads is completely different in kind, consisting not in
exaggerated austerities, but partly, at least, in transmigration or
metensomatosis: seven years to be a fish, 20, #I#, #J#, #K#; seven years
a bird, 20, #I#, #J#, #K#; seven years a stone, 21, #A#, #B#; seven
years an eel, 20, #J#; seven years a bell, or bell-clapper, 20, #I#, 21,
#A# (to ring a bell, 20, #K#, #L#). Seven years in hell seems to have
been part of the penance or penalty in every case: seven years a porter
in hell, 21, #B#, 20, #I#, #K#; seven years down in hell, 20, #J#; seven
years to "ring the bell and see sic sights as ye darna tell, 20, #L#;"
"other seven to lead an ape in hell," #A#, a burlesque variation of the
portership.

The Finnish Mataleena, going to the well for water, sees the reflection
of her face, and bewails her lost charms. Jesus begs a drink: she says
she has no can, no glass. He bids her confess. "Where are your three
boys? One you threw into the fire, one into the water, and one you
buried in the wilderness." She fills a pail with her tears, washes his
feet, and wipes them with her hair: then asks for penance. "Put me, Lord
Jesus, where you will. Make me a ladder-bridge over the sea, a brand in
the fire, a coal in the furnace."

There are several Slavic ballads which blend the story of the Samaritan
woman and that of 'The Cruel Mother,' without admixture of the Magdalen.
#Wendish# #A,# 'Aria' (M-aria?), Haupt and Schmaler, I, 287, No 290, has
a maid Who goes for water on Sunday morning, and is joined by an old man
who asks for a drink. She says the water is not clean; it is dusty and
covered with leaves. He says, The water is clean, but you are unclean.
She demands proof, and he bids her go to church in her maiden wreath.
This she does. The grass withers before her, a track of blood follows
her, and in the churchyard there come to her nine headless boys, who
say, Nine sons hast thou killed, chopt off their heads, and meanest to
do the same for a tenth. She entreats their forgiveness, enters the
church, sprinkles herself with holy water, kneels at the altar and
crosses herself, then suddenly sinks into the ground, so that nothing is
to be seen but her yellow hair. #B#, 'Die Kindesm[:o]rderin,' _ib._, II,
149, No 197, begins like #A#. As the maid proceeds to the church, nine
graves open before her, and nine souls follow her into the church. The
oldest of her children springs upon her and breaks her neck, saying,
"Mother, here is thy reward. Nine of us didst thou kill."

There are two #Moravian# ballads of the same tenor: #A#, Deutsches
Museum, 1855, I, 282, translated by M. Klapp: #B#, communicated to the
Zeitschrift des b[:o]hmischen Museums, 1842, p. 401, by A.W. [vS]embera, as
sung by the "m[:a]hrisch sprechenden Slawen" in Prussian Silesia; the first
seven stanzas translated in Haupt u. Schmaler, II, 314, note to No 197.
The Lord God goes out one Sunday morning, and meets a maid, whom he asks
for water. She says the water is not clean. He replies that it is
cleaner than she; for (#A#) she has seduced fifteen men and had
children with all of them, has filled hell with the men and the sea with
the children. He sends her to church; but, as she enters the
church-yard, the bells begin to ring (of themselves), and when she
enters the church, all the images turn their backs. As she falls on her
knees, she is changed into a pillar of salt.

The popular ballads of some of the southern nations give us the legend
of the Magdalen without mixture.

#French.# #A#, Po['e]sies populaires de la France, I (not paged), from
Sermoyer, Ain, thirty lines, made stanzas by repetition. Mary goes from
door to door seeking Jesus. He asks what she wants: she answers, To be
shriven. Her sins have been such, she says, that the earth ought not to
bear her up, the trees that see her can but tremble. For penance she is
to stay seven years in the woods of Baume, eat the roots of the trees,
drink the dew, and sleep under a juniper. Jesus comes to inquire about
her when this space has expired. She says she is well, but her hands,
once white as flower-de-luce, are now black as leather. For this Jesus
requires her to stay seven years longer, and then, being thoroughly
cured of her old vanities, she is told,

    'Marie Magdeleine, allez au paradis;
    La porte en est ouverte depuis hier [a'] midi.'

#B# is nearly the same legend in Proven[c,]al: Damase Arbaud, I, 64. The
penance is seven years in a cave, at the end of which Jesus passes, and
asks Mary what she has had to eat and drink. "Wild roots, and not always
them; muddy water, and not always that." The conclusion is peculiar.
Mary expresses a wish to wash her hands. Jesus pricks the rock, and
water gushes out. She bewails the lost beauty of her hands, and is
remanded to the cavern for another seven years. Upon her exclaiming at
the hardship, Jesus tells her that Martha shall come to console her, the
wood-dove fetch her food, the birds drink. But Mary is not reconciled:

    'Lord God, my good father,
      Make me not go back again!
    With the tears from my eyes
      I will wash my hands clean.

    'With the tears from my eyes
      I will wash your feet,
    And then I will dry them
      With the hair of my head.'

#C#, Po['e]sies populaires de la Gascogne, Blad['e], 1881, p. 339; 'La
pauvre Madeleine,' seventeen stanzas of four short lines, resembles #B#
till the close. When Jesus comes back after the second penance, and
Mary says, as she had before, that she has lived like the beasts, only
she has lacked water, Jesus again causes water to spring from the rock.
But Mary says, I want no water. I should have to go back to the cave
for another seven years. She is conducted straightway to paradise.

#D#, Blad['e], as before, p. 183, 'Marie-Madeleine,' six stanzas of five
short lines. Mary is sent to the mountains for seven years' penance; at
the end of that time washes her hands in a brook, and is guilty of
admiring them; is sent back to the mountains for seven years, and is
then taken to heaven.

A #Catalan# ballad combines the legend of the Magdalen's penance with
that of her conversion: Mil['a], Observaciones, p. 128, No 27, 'Santa
Magdalena,' and Briz y Salt['o], Cansons de la Terra, II, 99. Martha,
returning from church, asks Magdalen, who is combing her hair with a
gold comb, if she has been at mass. Magdalen says no, nor had she
thought of going. Martha advises her to go, for she certainly will fall
in love with the preacher, a young man; pity that he ever was a friar.
Magdalen attires herself with the utmost splendor, and, to hear the
sermon better, takes a place immediately under the pulpit. The first
word of the sermon touched her; at the middle she fainted. She stripped
off all her ornaments, and laid them at the preacher's feet. At the door
of the church she inquired of a penitent where Jesus was to be found.
She sought him out at the house of Simon, washed his feet with her
tears, and wiped them with her hair, picked up from the floor the bones
which he had thrown away. Jesus at last noticed her, and asked what she
wished. She wished to confess. He imposed the penance of seven years on
a mountain, "eating herbs and fennels, eating bitter herbs." Magdalen
turned homewards after the seven years, and found on the way a spring,
where she washed her hands, with a sigh over their disfigurement. She
heard a voice that said, Magdalen, thou hast sinned. She asked for new
penance, and was sent back to the mountain for seven years more. At the
end of this second term she died, and was borne to the skies with every
honor from the Virgin, saints, and angels.

ST STEPHEN AND HEROD

        Sloane MS., 2593, fol. 22 b; British Museum.


The manuscript which preserves this delightful little legend has been
judged by the handwriting to be of the age of Henry VI. It was printed
entire by Mr T. Wright, in 1856, for the Warton Club, under the title,
Songs and Carols, from a manuscript in the British Museum of the
fifteenth century, the ballad at p. 63. Ritson gave the piece as 'A
Carol for St Stephen's Day,' in Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 83, and it has
often been repeated; e. g., in Sandys' Christmas Carols, p. 4,
Sylvester's, p. 1.

The story, with the Wise Men replacing Stephen, is also found in the
carol, still current, of 'The Carnal and the Crane,' Sandys, p. 152, in
conjunction with other legends and in this order: the Nativity, the Wise
Men's passage with Herod, the Massacre of the Innocents, the Flight into
Egypt, Herod and the Sower.

The legend of Stephen and Herod occurs, and is even still living, in
Scandinavian tradition, combined, as in English, with others relating to
the infancy of Jesus.

#Danish.# 'Jesusbarnet, Stefan og Herodes:' #A#, Grundtvig, No 96, II,
525. First printed in Erik Pontoppidan's little book on the reliques of
Paganism and Papistry among the Danish People, 1736, p. 70, as taken
down from the singing of an old beggar-woman before the author's
door.[184] Syv alludes to the ballad in 1695, and cites one stanza. The
first five of eleven stanzas are devoted to the beauty of the Virgin,
the Annunciation, and the birth of the Saviour. The song then goes on
thus:

    6
    Saint Stephen leads the foals to water,
      All by the star so gleaming:
    'Of a truth the prophet now is born
      That all the world shall ransom.'

    7
    King Herod answered thus to him:
      'I'll not believe this story,
    Till the roasted cock that is on the board
      Claps his wings and crows before me.'

    8
    The cock he clapped his wings and crew,
      'Our Lord, this is his birthday!'
    Herod fell off from his kingly seat,
      For grief he fell a swooning.

    9
    King Herod bade saddle his courser gray,
      He listed to ride to Bethlem;
    Fain would he slay the little child
      That to cope with him pretended.

    10
    Mary took the child in her arms,
      And Joseph the ass took also,
    So they traversed the Jewish land,
      To Egypt, as God them guided.

    11
    The little children whose blood was shed,
      They were full fourteen thousand,
    But Jesus was thirty miles away
      Before the sun was setting.

#B.# A broadside of fourteen four-line stanzas, in two copies, #a# of
the middle, #b# from the latter part, of the last century. #b# was
printed "in the Dansk Kirketidende for 1862, No 43," by Professor George
Stephens: #a# is given by Grundtvig, III, 881. The first three stanzas
correspond to #A# 1-5, the next three to #A# 6-8: the visit of the Wise
Men to Herod is then intercalated, 7-10, and the story concludes as in
#A# 9-11.

#C.# 'Sankt Steffan,' Kristensen, II, 123, No 36, from recitation about
1870, eight four-line stanzas, 1-3 agreeing with #A# 3-6, 4-6 with #A#
6-9, 7, 8 with #A# 9, 11. The verbal resemblance with the copy sung by
the old beggar-woman more than a hundred and thirty years before is
often close.

A #F[:a]r[:o]e# version, 'Rudisar v['i]sa,' was communicated to the Dansk
Kirketidende for 1852, p. 293, by Hammershaimb, twenty-six two-line
stanzas (Grundtvig, II, 519). Stephen is in Herod's service. He goes out
and sees the star in the east, whereby he knows that the Saviour of the
world, "the great king," is born. He comes in and makes this
announcement. Herod orders his eyes to be put out: so, he says, it will
appear whether this "king" will help him. They put out Stephen's eyes,
but now he sees as well by night as before by day. At this moment a
cock, roast and carved, is put on the board before Herod, who cries out:

    'If this cock would stand up and crow,
    Then in Stephen's tale should I trow.'

    Herod he stood, and Herod did wait,
    The cock came together that lay in the plate.

    The cock flew up on the red gold chair,
    He clapped his wings, and he crew so fair.

Herod orders his horse and rides to Bethlehem, to find the new-born
king. As he comes in, Mary greets him, and tells him there is still mead
and wine. He answers that she need not be so mild with him: he will have
her son and nail him on the cross. "Then you must go to heaven for him,"
says Mary. Herod makes an attempt on Jesus, but is seized by twelve
angels and thrown into the Jordan, where the Evil One takes charge of
him.

#Swedish.# A single stanza, corresponding to Danish #A# 6, #B# 4, #C# 4,
is preserved in a carol, 'Staffans Visa,' which was wont to be sung all
over Sweden on St Stephen's day, in the Christmas sport, not yet given
up, called Staffansskede; which consisted in young fellows riding about
from house to house early in the morning of the second day of Yule, and
levying refreshments.[185] One of the party carried at the end of a pole
a lighted lantern, made of hoops and oiled paper, which was sometimes in
the shape of a six-cornered star. Much of the chant was improvised, and
both the good wishes and the suggestions as to the expected treat would
naturally be suited to particular cases; but the first stanza, with but
slight variations, was (Afzelius, III, 208, 210):

    Stephen was a stable-groom,
      We thank you now so kindly!
    He watered the five foals all and some,
      Ere the morning star was shining.
      No daylight's to be seen,
      The stars in the sky
        Are gleaming.

or,

    Stephen was a stable-groom,
      Bear thee well my foal!
    He watered the five foals all and some,
      God help us and Saint Stephen!
      The sun is not a-shining,
      But the stars in the sky
        Are gleaming.

There is also a Swedish ballad which has the substance of the story of
Danish #A# 6-8, but without any allusion to Stephen. It occurs as a
broadside, in two copies, dated 1848, 1851, and was communicated by
Professor Stephens to the Dansk Kirketidende, 1861, Nos 3, 4, and is
reprinted by Grundtvig, III, 882 f, and in Bergstr[:o]m's Afzelius, II, 360
f. There are eleven four-line stanzas, of which the last six relate how
Mary was saved from Herod by the miracle of the Sower (see 'The Carnal
and the Crane,' stanzas 18-28). The first five cover the matter of our
ballad. The first runs:

    In Bethlem of Judah a star there rose,
      At the time of the birth of Christ Jesus:
    'Now a child is born into the world
      That shall suffer for us death and torment.'

Herod then calls his court and council, and says to them, as he says to
Stephen in the Danish ballad, "I cannot believe your story unless the
cock on this table claps his wings and crows." This comes to pass, and
Herod exclaims that he can never thrive till he has made that child feel
the effects of his wrath. He then steeps his hands in the blood of the
Innocents, and falls off his throne in a marvellous swoon. Mary is
warned to fly to Egypt. It is altogether likely that the person who
speaks in the first stanza was originally the same as the one who says
nearly the same thing in the three Danish ballads, that is, Stephen, and
altogether unlikely that Herod's words, which are addressed to Stephen
in the Danish ballads, were addressed to his court and council rather
than to Stephen here.

#Norwegian.# Two stanzas, much corrupted, of what may have been a ballad
like the foregoing, have been recovered by Professor Bugge, and are
given by Grundtvig, III, 883.

St Stephen's appearance as a stable-groom, expressly in the Swedish
carol and by implication in the Danish ballads, is to be explained by
his being the patron of horses among the northern nations.[186] On his
day, December 26, which is even called in Germany the great Horse Day,
it was the custom for horses to be let blood to keep them well during
the year following, or raced to protect them from witches. In Sweden
they were watered "ad alienos fontes" (which, perhaps, is what Stephen
is engaged in in the carol), and treated to the ale which had been left
in the cups on St Stephen's eve; etc., etc.[187] This way of observing
St Stephen's day is presumed to be confined to the north of Europe, or
at least to be derived from that quarter. Other saints are patrons of
horses in the south, as St Eloi, St Antony, and we must seek the
explanation of St Stephen's having that office in Scandinavia, Germany,
and England in the earlier history of these regions. It was suggested as
long ago as the middle of the sixteenth century by the Archbishop Olaus
Magnus, that the horseracing, which was universal in Sweden on December
26, was a remnant of heathen customs. The horse was sacred to Frey, and
Yule was Frey's festival. There can hardly be a doubt that the customs
connected with St Stephen's day are a continuation, under Christian
auspices, of old rites and habits which, as in so many other cases, the
church found it easier to consecrate than to abolish.[188]

The miracle of the cock is met with in other ballads, which, for the
most part, relate the wide-spread legend of the Pilgrims of St James.

#French.# In three versions, Chants de Pauvres en Forez et en Velay,
collected by M. Victor Smith, Romania, II, 473 ff. Three pilgrims,
father, mother, and son, on their way to St James, stop at an inn, at St
Dominic. A maid-servant, enamored of the youth (qui ressemble une image,
que semblavo-z-un ange) is repelled by him, and in revenge puts a silver
cup [cups] belonging to the house into his knapsack. The party is
pursued and brought back, and the young pilgrim is hanged. He exhorts
his father to accomplish his vow, and to come that way when he returns.
When the father returns, after three [six] months, the boy is found to
be alive; his feet have been supported, and he has been nourished, by
God and the saints. The father tells the judge that his son is alive;
the judge replies, I will believe that when this roast fowl crows. The
bird crows: #A#, le poulet se mit a chanter sur la table; #B#, le poulet
vole au ciel, trois fois n'a battu l'aile; #C#, trois fois il a chant['e],
trois fois l'a battu l'aile. The boy is taken down and the maid hanged.

#Spanish.# #A#, Mil['a], Observaciones sobre la Poesia Popular, p. 106, No
7, 'El Romero;' #B#, Briz, Cansons de la Terra, I, 71, 'S. Jaume de
Galicia,' two copies essentially agreeing. The course of the story is
nearly as in the French. The son does not ask his father to come back.
It is a touch of nature that the mother cannot be prevented from going
back by all that her husband can say. The boy is more than well. St
James has been sustaining his feet, the Virgin his head. He directs his
mother to go to the alcalde (Mil['a]), who will be dining on a cock and a
hen, and to request him politely to release her son, who is still alive.
The alcalde replies: "Off with you! Your son is as much alive as this
cock and hen." The cock began to crow, the hen laid an egg in the dish!

#Dutch.# 'Een liedeken van sint Jacob,' Antwerpener Liederbuch, 1544, No
20, Hoffmann, p. 26; Uhland, p. 803, No 303; Willems, p. 318, No 133.
The pilgrims here are only father and son. The host's daughter avows her
love to her father, and desires to detain the young pilgrim. The older
pilgrim, hearing of this, says, My son with me and I with him. We will
seek St James, as pilgrims good and true. The girl puts the cup in the
father's sack. The son offers himself in his father's place, and is
hanged. The father finds that St James and the Virgin have not been
unmindful of the pious, and tells the host that his son is alive. The
host, in a rage, exclaims, "That's as true as that these roast fowls
shall fly out at the door!"

    But ere the host could utter the words,
    One by one from the spit brake the birds,
      And into the street went flitting;
    They flew on the roof of St Dominic's house,
      Where all the brothers were sitting.

The brothers resolve unanimously to go to the judicial authority in
procession; the innocent youth is taken down, the host hanged, and his
daughter buried alive.

#Wendish.# Haupt und Schmaler, I, 285, No 289, 'Der gehenkte
Schenkwirth.' There are two pilgrims, father and son. The host himself
puts his gold key into the boy's basket. The boy is hanged: the father
bids him hang a year and a day, till he returns. The Virgin has put a
stool under the boy's feet, and the angels have fed him. The father
announces to the host that his son is living. The host will not believe
this till three dry staves which he has in the house shall put out green
shoots. This comes to pass. The host will not believe till three fowls
that are roasting shall recover their feathers and fly out of the
window. This also comes to pass. The host is hanged.

A #Breton# ballad, 'Marguerite Laurent,' Luzel, I, #A#, p. 211, #B#, p.
215, inverts a principal circumstance in the story of the pilgrims: a
maid is hanged on a false accusation of having stolen a piece of plate.
This may be an independent tradition or a corrupt form of the other.
Marguerite has, by the grace of St Anne and of the Virgin, suffered no
harm. A young clerk, her lover, having ascertained this, reports the
case to the seneschal, who will not believe till the roasted capon on
the dish crows. The capon crows. Marguerite goes on her bare knees to St
Anne and to Notre-Dame du Folgoat, and dies in the church of the latter
(first version).

'Notre-Dame du Folgoat,' Villemarqu['e], Barzaz Breiz, p. 272, No 38, 6th
ed., is of a different tenor. Marie Fanchonik, wrongly condemned to be
executed for child murder, though hanged, does not die. The executioner
reports to the seneschal. "Burn her," says the seneschal. "Though in
fire up to her breast," says the executioner, "she is laughing
heartily." "Sooner shall this capon crow than I will believe you." The
capon crows: a roast capon on the dish, all eaten but the feet.

Religious writers of the 13th century have their version of the story of
the pilgrims, but without the prodigy of the cock. Vincent of Beauvais,
Speculum Historiale, 1. 26, c. 33, who bases his narrative on a
collection of the miracles of St James incorrectly attributed to Pope
Callixtus II,[189] has but two pilgrims, Germans, father and son. On
their way to Compostella they pass a night in an inn at Toulouse. The
host, having an eye to the forfeiture of their effects, makes them drunk
and hides a silver cup in their wallet. Son wishes to die for father,
and father for son. The son is hanged, and St James interposes to
preserve his life.[190] With Vincent agree the author of the Golden
Legend, following Callixtus, Graesse, 2d ed., p. 426, c. 99 (94), [S]
5,[191] and C[ae]sarius Heisterbacensis, Dialogus Miraculorum, c. 58, II,
130, ed. Strange, who, however, does not profess to remember every
particular, and omits to specify Toulouse as the place. Nicolas
Bertrand, who published in 1515 a history of Toulouse, places the
miracle there.[192] He has three pilgrims, like the French and Spanish
ballads, and the roast fowl flying from the spit to convince a doubting
official, like the Dutch and Wendish ballads.

But, much earlier than the last date, this miracle of St James had
become connected with the town of San Domingo de la Calzada, one of the
stations on the way to Compostella,[193] some hours east of Burgos.
Roig, the Valencian poet, on arriving there in the course of his
pilgrimage, tells the tale briefly, with two roasted fowls, cock and
hen: Lo Libre de les Dones e de Con[c,]ells, 1460, as printed by Briz from
the edition of 1735, p. 42, Book 2, vv. 135-183. Lucio Marineo, whose
work, De las cosas memorables de Espa[~n]a, appeared in 1530, had been at
San Domingo, and is able to make some addition to the miracle of the
cock. Up to the revivification, his account agrees very well with the
Spanish ballad. A roast cock and hen are lying before the mayor, and
when he expresses his incredulity, they jump from the dish on to the
table, in feathers whiter than snow. After the pilgrims had set out a
second time on their way to Compostella, to return thanks to St James,
the mayor returned to his house with the priests and all the people, and
took the cock and hen to the church, where they lived seven years, and
then died, leaving behind them a pair of the same snowy whiteness, who
in turn, after seven years, left their successors, and so on to
Marineo's day; and though of the infinite number of pilgrims who
resorted to the tomb each took away a feather, the plumage was always
full, and Marineo speaks as an eye-witness. (Edition of 1539, fol.
xliii.) Dr Andrew Borde gives nearly the same account as Marineo, in the
First Book of the Introduction of Knowledge, 1544, p. 202 ff, ed.
Furnivall.[194]

Early in the sixteenth century the subject was treated in at least two
miracle-plays, for which it is very well adapted: Un miracolo di tre
Pellegrini, printed at Florence early in the sixteenth century,
D'Ancona, Sacre Rappresentazioni, III, 465; Ludus Sancti Jacobi,
fragment de myst[e']re proven[c,]ale, Camille Arnaud, 1858.[195]

Nicolas Bertrand, before referred to, speaks of the miracle as depicted
in churches and chapels of St James. It was, for example, painted by
Pietro Antonio of Foligno, in the fifteenth century, in SS. Antonio e
Jacopo at Assisi, and by Pisanello in the old church of the Tempio at
Florence, and, in the next century, by Palmezzano in S. Biagio di S.
Girolamo at Forl[i'], and by Lo Spagna in a small chapel or tribune
dedicated to St James, about four miles from Spoleto, on the way to
Foligno. The same legend is painted on one of the lower windows of St
Ouen, and again on a window of St Vincent, at Rouen. Many more cases
might, no doubt, be easily collected.[196]

It is not at all surprising that a miracle performed at San Domingo de
la Calzada should, in the course of time, be at that place attributed to
the patron of the locality; and we actually find Luis de la Vega, in a
life of this San Domingo published at Burgos in 1606, repeating
Marineo's story, very nearly, with a substitution of Dominic for
James.[197] More than this, this author claims for this saint, who,
saving reverence, is decidedly _minorum gentium_, the merit and glory of
delivering a captive from the Moors, wherein he, or tradition, makes
free again with St James's rightful honors. The Moor, when told that the
captive will some day be missing, rejoins, If you keep him as close as
when I last saw him, he will as soon escape as this roast cock will fly
and crow. It is obvious that this anecdote is a simple jumble of two
miracles of St James, the freeing of the captives, recounted in Acta
Sanctorum, VI Julii, p. 47, [S] 190f, and the saving the life of the young
pilgrim.[198]

The restoration of a roasted fowl to life is also narrated in Acta
Sanctorum, I Septembris, p. 529, [S] 289, as occurring early in the
eleventh century (the date assigned to the story of the pilgrims), at
the table of St Stephen, the first king of Hungary. St Gunther was
sitting with the king while he was dining. The king pressed Gunther to
partake of a roast peacock, but Gunther, as he was bound by his rule to
do, declined. The king then ordered him to eat. Gunther bent his head
and implored the divine mercy; the bird flew up from the dish; the king
no longer persisted. The author of the article, without questioning the
reality of the miracle, well remarks that there seems to be something
wrong in the story, since it is impossible that the holy king should
have commanded the saint to break his vow.

But the prime circumstances in the legend, the resuscitation of the
cock, does not belong in the eleventh century, where Vincent and others
have put it, but in the first, where it is put by the English and
Scandinavian ballads. A French romance somewhat older than Vincent,
Ogier le Danois, agrees with the later English ballad in making the
occasion to be the visit of the Wise Men to Herod. Herod will not
believe what they say,

    'Se cis capon que ci m'est en pr['e]sant
    N'en est plumeus com il estoit devant,
    Et se redrece [a'] la perche en cantant.'

                              vv 11621-23.

And what he exacts is performed for his conviction.[199] Nevertheless,
as we shall now see, the true epoch of the event is not the Nativity,
but the Passion.

The ultimate source of the miracle of the reanimated cock is an
interpolation in two late Greek manuscripts of the so-called Gospel of
Nicodemus: Thilo, Codex Apocryphus Novi Testamenti, p. cxxix f;
Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocrypha, p. 269, note 3. After Judas had tried
to induce the Jews to take back the thirty pieces, he went to his house
to hang himself, and found his wife sitting there, and a cock roasting
on a spit before the coals. He said to his wife, Get me a rope, for I
mean to hang myself, as I deserve. His wife said to him, Why do you say
such things? And Judas said to her, Know in truth that I have betrayed
my master Jesus to evil-doers, who will put him to death. But he will
rise on the third day, and woe to us. His wife said, Do not talk so nor
believe it; for this cock that is roasting before the coals will as soon
crow as Jesus rise again as you say. And even while she was speaking the
words, the cock flapped his wings and crew thrice. Then Judas was still
more persuaded, and straightway made a noose of the rope and hanged
himself.[200]

The Cursor Mundi gives its own turn to this relation, with the intent to
blacken Judas a little more.[201] When Judas had betrayed Jesus, he went
to his mother with his pence, boasting of the act. "Hast thou sold thy
master?" said she. "Shame shall be thy lot, for they will put him to
death; but he shall rise again." "Rise, mother?" said Judas, "sooner
shall this cock rise up that was scalded yesternight."

    Hardly had he said the word,
      The cock leapt up and flew,
    Feathered fairer than before,
      And by God's grace he crew;
    The traitor false began to fear,
      His peril well he knew.
    This cock it was the self-same cock
      Which Peter made to rue,
    When he had thrice denied his lord
      And proved to him untrue.

A still different version existed among the Copts, who had their copies
of the apocryphal writings, and among them the gospel of Nicodemus.

The Copts say, according to Th['e]venot, "that on the day of the Supper a
roasted cock was served to our Lord, and that when Judas went out to
sell Jesus to the Jews, the Saviour commanded the cock to get up and
follow him; which the cock did, and brought back his report to our Lord
that Judas had sold him, for which service this cock shall be admitted
to paradise."[202]

The herald of the morn is described in other carols as making known the
birth of the Saviour to the animal creation, or the more familiar
members of it.

"There is a sheet of carols headed thus: 'CHRISTUS NATUS EST, Christ is
born,' with a wood-cut ten inches high by eight and one half inches
wide, representing the stable at Bethlehem; Christ in the crib, watched
by the Virgin and Joseph; shepherds kneeling; angels attending; a man
playing on the bagpipes; a woman with a basket of fruit on her head; a
sheep bleating and an ox lowing on the ground; a raven croaking and a
crow cawing on the hay-rack; a cock crowing above them; and angels
singing in the sky. The animals have labels from their mouths, bearing
Latin inscriptions. Down the side of the wood-cut is the following
account and explanation: 'A religious man, inventing the conceits of
both birds and beasts, drawn in the picture of our Saviour's birth, doth
thus express them. The cock croweth _Christus natus est_, Christ is
born. The raven asked _Quando_, When? The crow replied, _Hac nocte_,
This night. The ox cryeth out, _Ubi, ubi?_ Where, where? The sheep
bleated out, _Bethlehem_, Bethlehem. A voice from heaven sounded,
_Gloria in excelsis_, Glory be on high!'" London, 1701. Hone's Every-Day
Book, I, col. 1600 f.

A little Greek ballad, 'The Taking of Constantinople,' only seven lines
long, relates a miracle entirely like that of the cock, which was
operated for the conviction of incredulity. A nun, frying fish, hears a
voice from above, saying, Cease your frying, the city will fall into the
hands of the Turks. "When the fish fly out of the pan alive," she says,
"then shall the Turks take the city." The fish fly out of the pan alive,
and the Turkish admiraud comes riding into the city. Zambelios, p. 600,
No 2; Passow, p. 147, No 197. (Liebrecht, Volkskunde, p. 179.)

With Herod's questions and Stephen's answers in stanzas 5-8, we may

Bergstr[:o]m in his edition of Afzelius, II, 358, note 28. Skede is
gallop, or run, Icelandic skei[dh] (Bergstr[:o]m), Norwegian skeid,
skjei. Many copies of the Staffansvisa have been collected: see
Bergstr[:o]m's Afzelius, II, 356: and for a description of the custom
as practised among Swedes in Finland, with links and lanterns, but no

39 ff. Something very similar was known in Holstein: see Sch[:u]tze,
Holsteinsches Idioticon, III, 200, as quoted by Grundtvig, II, 521,
note **. From Chambers' Book of Days, II, 763 f, it appears that a
custom, called a Stephening, was still existing at the beginning of
this century, of the inhabitants of the parish of Drayton Beauchamp,
Bucks, paying a visit to the rector on December 26, and lightening his
stores of all the bread, cheese and ale they wanted. Chambers, again,
in his Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 168 f, gives a song closely
resembling the Staffansvisa, which was sung before every house on New
Year's eve, in Deerness, Orkney, with the same object of stimulating
hospitality. Similar practices are known in the Scottish Highlands: see
Campbell, Tales of the West Highlands, III, 19, and Chambers, at p. 167
of the Popular Rhymes.

[186] Stephen in all the ballads can be none other than the first
martyr, though Ihre, and other Swedes since his day, choose, for their
part, to understand a "Stephanum primum Helsingorum apostolum," who
certainly did not see the star in the east. The peasantry in
Helsingland, we are told, make their saints' day December 26, too, and
their St Stephen is a great patron of horses. The misappropriation of
the glories of the protomartyr is somewhat transparent.

[187] Grundtvig, whom I chiefly follow here, II, 521-24. In a note on
page 521, supplemented at III, 883 e, Grundtvig has collected much
interesting evidence of December 26 being the great Horse Day. J. W.
Wolf, cited by Grundtvig, II, 524, had said previously: "Nichts im leben
des ersten christlichen blutzeugen erinnert auch nur fern an pferde;
trotzdem machte das volk ihn zum patron der pferde, und setzte ihn also
an die stelle des Fro, dem im Norden, und nicht weniger bei uns, die
pferde heilig waren." Beitr[:a]ge zur deutschen Mythologie, I, 124.

[188] Jean Baptiste Thiers, Trait['e] des Superstitions, etc., 2d

Imperialia, p. 233, No 169, condemns the belief, "qu'il vaut bien mieux
...saigner des chevaux le jour de la f[^e]te de S. Estienne qu'[a']
tout autre jour." This may be one of the practices which Thiers had
learned of from his reading (see Liebrecht's preface, p. xvii f),
but might also have migrated from the east or north into France.
Superstitions, like new fashions, are always sure of a hospitable
reception, even though they impose a servitude.

[189] From a copy of this collection the story is given in Acta
Sanctorum, VI Julii, p. 50, [S] 202 ff.

[190] Vincent, as pointed out by Professor George Stephens, knew of the
miracle of the cock, and tells it at l. 25, c. 64, on the authority of
Pietro Damiani. Two Bolognese dining together, one of them carved a cock
and dressed it with pepper and sauce. "Gossip," says the other, "you
have 'fixed' that cock so that Peter himself could not put him on his
legs again." "Peter? No, not Christ himself." At this the cock jumped
up, in all his feathers, clapped his wings, crow, and threw the sauce
all over the blasphemous pair, whereby they were smitten with leprosy.

[192] Opus de Tholosanorum gestis, fol. 49 verso, according to Acta S.,
p. 46, of the volume last cited. Toulouse rivalled with Compostella in
the possession of relics of St James, and was amply entitled to the
honor of the miracle. Dr Andrew Borde, in his First Book of the
Introduction of Knowledge, says that an ancient doctor of divinity at
Compostella told him, "We have not one hair nor bone of St. James; for
St James the More and St James the Less, St Bartholomew and St Philip,
St Simon and Jude, St Bernard and St George, with divers other saints,
Carolus Magnus brought them to Toulouse." Ed. Furnivall, p. 204 f. I do
not know where the splenetic old divine got his information, but
certainly from no source so trustworthy as the chronicle of Turpin.
Besides other places in France, the body, or at least the head, of St
James was claimed by churches in Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries.
But the author of an old Itinerary of the Pilgrims to Compostella
asserts that James the Greater is one of four saints who never changed
his burial-place. See Victor Le Clerc in Hist. Litt. de la France, xxi,
283.

Antonio, and d'Ancona refers to Pisanello's.

[197] He denies the perpetual multiplication of the feathers, and adds
that the very gallows on which the pilgrim was hanged is erected in the
upper part of the church, where everybody can see it. It is diverting to
find Grossenhain, in Saxony, claiming the miracle on the ground of a big
cock in an altar picture in a chapel of St James: Gr[:a]sse, Sagenschatz

[198] For Luis de la Vega, see Acta Sanctorum, III Maii, p. 171 f,
[S][S] 6, 7, 8, VI Julii, p. 46, [S] 187. The Spanish and the Dutch
ballad give due glory to St James and the Virgin; French #C# to God and
St James. The Wendish ballad can hardly be expected to celebrate St
James, and refers the justification and saving of the boy to the Virgin
and the saints. French #A# has St Michas; #B#, God and the Virgin.

Luis de la Vega, with what seems an excess of caution, says, p. 172, as
above, [S] 8: appositique erant ad comedendum gallus et gallina, _assati
nescio an elixi_. Of boiled fowl we have not heard so far. But we find
in a song in Fletcher's play of 'The Spanish Curate,' this stanza:

    The stewd cock shall crow, cock-a-loodle-loo,
      A loud cock-a-loodle shall he crow;
    The duck and the drake shall swim in a lake
      Of onions and claret below.

                              Act III, Sc. 2; Dyce, viii, 436.

In Father Merolla's Voyage to Congo, 1682, a reference to which I owe to
Liebrecht, there is a story of a stewed cock, which, on the whole,
justifies Luis de la Vega's scruple. This must have been introduced into
Africa by some missioner, and, when so introduced, the miracle must have
had an object, which it had lost before the tale came to Father Merolla.

One of two parties at feud having marched upon the chief city of his
antagonist, and found all the inhabitants fled, the soldiers fell to
rifling the houses and killing all the living creatures they met, to
satisfy their hunger. "Amongst the rest they found a cock of a larger
size than ordinary, with a great ring of iron about one of his legs,
which occasioned one of the wisest among them to cry out, Surely this
cock must be bewitched, and it is not at all proper for us to meddle
with. To which the rest answered, Be it what it will, we are resolved to
eat it. For this end they immediately killed and tore it to pieces after
the manner of the negroes, and afterwards put it into a pot to boil.
When it was enough, they took it out into a platter, and two, according
to the custom, having said grace, five of them sat down to it with great
greediness. But before they had touched a bit, to their great wonder and
amazement, the boiled pieces of the cock, though sodden, and near
dissolved, began to move about and unite into the form they were in
before, and, being so united, the restored cock immediately raised
himself up, and jumped out of the platter upon the ground, where he
walked about as well as when he was first taken. Afterwards he leaped
upon an adjoining wall, where he became new feathered all of a sudden,
and then took his flight to a tree hard by, where fixing himself, he,
after three claps of his wings, made a most hideous noise, and then
disappeared. Every one may easily imagine what a terrible fright the
spectators were in at this sight, who, leaping with a thousand Ave
Marias in their mouths from the place where this had happened, were
contented to observe most of the particulars at a distance." It appears
that the brother of one of the two contending parties was said to have
had a very large cock, from whose crowing he took auguries, but whether
this was the same as the one restored to life is not known. Churchill's

JUDAS

        MS. B. 14, 39, of the thirteenth century, library of
        Trinity College, Cambridge, as printed in Wright &
        Halliwell's Reliqui[ae] Antiqu[ae], I, 144.


This legend, which has not been heretofore recognized as a ballad, is,
so far as is known, unique in several particulars. The common tradition
gives Judas an extraordinary domestic history,[204] but does not endow
him with a sister as perfidious as himself. Neither is his selling his
Master for thirty pieces accounted for elsewhere as it is here, if it
may be strictly said to be accounted for here.

A popular explanation, founded upon John xii, 3-6, and current for six
centuries and more, is that Judas, bearing the bag, was accustomed to
take tithes of all moneys that came into his hands, and that he
considered he had lost thirty pence on the precious ointment which had
not been sold for three hundred pence, and took this way of indemnifying
himself.

A Wendish ballad, Haupt und Schmaler, I, 276, No 284, has the following
story. Jesus besought hospitality for himself and his disciples of a
poor widow. She could give a lodging, but had no bread. Jesus said he
would care for that, and asked which of his disciples would go and buy
bread for thirty pieces of silver. Judas offered himself eagerly, and
went to the Jews' street to do his errand. Jews were gaming, under a
tub, and they challenged Judas to play. The first time he won the stake,
and the second. The third time he lost everything. "Why so sad, Judas?"
they say: "go sell your Master for thirty pieces." We are to suppose
Judas to have rejoined his company. Jesus then asks who has sold him.
John says, Is it I? and Peter, and then Judas, to whom Jesus replies,
Thou knowest best. Judas, in remorse, runs to hang himself. The Lord
bids him turn, for his sin is forgiven. But Judas keeps on till he comes
to a fir: "Soft wood, thou fir, thou wilt not bear me." Further on, till
he comes to an aspen. "Hard wood, thou aspen, thou wilt bear me." So he
hanged himself on the aspen; and still the aspen shakes and trembles for
fear of the judgment day.

According to the ballads, then, Judas lost the thirty pieces at play, or
was robbed of them, with collusion of his sister. But his passionate
behavior in the English ballad, st. 9, goes beyond all apparent
occasion. Surely it was not for his tithe of the thirty pieces.

And why does he insist to Pilate on the very thirty pieces he had lost,
rejecting every other form of payment? The ballad-singer might answer,
So it was, and rest contented. Or perhaps he might have heard, and might
tell us by way of comment, that these pieces had for long ages been
destined to be "the price of him that was valued, whom they of the
children of Israel did value;" had been coined by Abraham's father for
Ninus, and been given by Terah to his son; had passed through various
hands to the Ishmaelites, had been paid by them as the price of Joseph,
and been repaid to Joseph by his brethren for corn in Egypt; thence were
transferred to Sheba, and in the course of events were brought by the
Queen of the South as an offering to Solomon's temple; when the temple
was despoiled by Nebuchadnezzar, were given by him to the king of
Godolia, and after the kingdom of Godolia had been fused in that of
Nubia, were brought as his tribute to the infant Jesus by Melchior, king
of the same, etc.[205]

It is much to be regretted that the manuscript from which this piece was
taken has been for some years lost from Trinity College Library, so that
a collation of Wright's text has not been possible.

BONNIE ANNIE

Had an old copy of this still pretty and touching, but much disordered,
ballad been saved, we should perhaps have had a story like this. Bonnie
Annie, having stolen her father's gold and her mother's fee, and fled
with her paramour (like the maid in No 4), the ship in which she is
sailing encounters a storm and cannot get on. Annie is seized with the
pangs of travail, and deplores the absence of women (#B# 6, 7, #A# 9,
10; compare No 15, 21-26). The sailors say there is somebody on board
who is marked for death, or flying from a just doom. They cast lots, and
the lot falls on Annie,--a result which strikes us as having more
semblance of the "corrupted currents of this world" than of a pure
judgment of God. Annie, conscious only of her own guilt, asks to be
thrown overboard. Her paramour offers great sums to the crew to save
her, but their efforts prove useless, and Annie again begs, or they now
insist, that she shall be cast into the sea with her babe. This done,
the ship is able to sail on; Annie floats to shore and is buried there.

The captain of the ship is the guilty man in #A#, in #B# a rich squire.
#A# may exhibit the original plot, but it is just as likely that the
captain was substituted for a passenger, under the influence of another
ballad, in which there is no Annie, but a ship-master stained with many
crimes, whom the lot points out as endangering or obstructing the
vessel. See 'Brown Robyn's Confession,' further on.

If the narrative in Jonah, i, is the ultimate source of this and similar
stories, it must be owned that the tradition has maintained its
principal traits in this ballad remarkably well. Jonah flies from the
presence of the Lord in a ship; the ship is overtaken by a tempest;[206]
the sailors cast lots to know who is the guilty cause, and the lot falls
on Jonah; he bids the sailors take him up and cast him into the sea;
nevertheless the men row hard to bring the ship to land, but cannot
succeed; they throw Jonah into the water, and the storm ceases.[207]

[206] Jonah is asleep below. This trait we find in several Norse
ballads: see 'Brown Robyn's Confession.'

[207] A singular episode in the life of Saint Mary Magdalen in the
Golden Legend, Gr[:a]sse, c. xcvi, 2, p. 409 ff, indicates a belief that
even a dead body might prejudice the safety of a ship. The princess of
Marseilles, in the course of a storm, has given birth to a boy and
expired. The sailors demand that the body shall be thrown into the sea
(and apparently the boy, too), for, they say, as long as it shall be
with us, this thumping will not cease. They presently see a hill, and
think it better to put off the corpse, _and the boy_, there, than that
these should be devoured by sea-monsters. Fear will fasten upon anything
in such a case.

Shakspere Society edition, ed. Furnivall.

This piece was first printed by Buchan, in 1828, and all the copies
which have been recovered are of about that date. The device of a
lover's feigning death as a means of winning a shy mistress enjoys a
considerable popularity in European ballads. Even more favorite is a
ballad in which the _woman_ adopts this expedient, in order to escape
from the control of her relations: see 'The Gay Goshawk,' with which
will be given another form of the present story.

A #Danish# ballad answering to our Feigned Lyke-Wake is preserved, as I
am informed by Professor Grundtvig, in no less than fourteen
manuscripts, some of them of the 16th century, and is still living in
tradition. Five versions, as yet unprinted, #A-E#, have been furnished
me by the editor of the Ballads of Denmark.

#A#, from a manuscript of the sixteenth century. Young Herre Karl asks
his mother's rede how he may get the maid his heart is set upon. She
advises him to feign sickness, and be laid on his bier, no one to know
his counsel but the page who is to do his errands. The page bids the
lady to the wake that night. Little Kirstin asks her mother's leave to
keep wake over Karl. The wake is to be in the upper room of Karl's
house. The mother says, Be on your guard; he means to cheat you; but
Kirstin, neither listening to her mother nor asking her father, goes to
keep wake in the upper room. When she went in she could not see the
lights for her tears. She begged all the good people to pray for Karl's
soul, sat down by his head and made her own prayer, and murmured, While
thou livedst I loved thee. She lifted the cloths, and there lay Karl
wide awake and laughing. "All the devils in hell receive thy soul!" she
cried. "If thou livedst a hundred years, thou shouldst never have my
good will! "Karl proposed that she should pass the night with him. "Why
would you deceive me!" Kirstin exclaimed. "Why did you not go to my
father and betroth me honorably?" Karl immediately rode to her father's
to do this, and they were married.

#B. a#, from MSS of 1610 and later, almost identical with #b#, 'Den
forstilte Vaagestue,' Levninger, Part II, 1784, p. 34, No 7.[208] This
version gives us some rather unnecessary previous history. Karl has sued
for Ingerlille three years, and had an ill answer. He follows her to
church one fine day, and, after mass, squeezes her fingers and asks,
Will you take pity on me? She replies, You must ask my father and
friends; and he, I have, and can get no good answer. If you will give me
your troth, we can see to that best ourselves. "Never," she says.
"Farewell, then; but Christ may change your mind." Karl meets his mother
on his way from church, who asks why he is so pale. He tells her his
plight, and is advised, as before, to use craft. The wake is held on
Karl's premises.[209] Ingerlille, in scarlet mantle, goes with her
maids. She avows her love, but adds that it was a fixed idea in her mind
that he would deceive her. She lifts up the white cloth that covers the
face. Karl laughs, and says, We were good friends before, so are we
still. Bear out the bier, and follow me to bed with the fair maid. She
hopes he will have respect for her honor. Karl reassures her, leaves her
with his mother, rides to Ingerlille's house, obtains her parents'
approbation, and buys wine for his wedding.

#C#, from manuscripts of the sixteenth century. Karl is given out for
dead, and his pages ride to the convent to ask that his body may be laid
in the cloister. The bier is borne in; the prioress comes to meet it,
with much respect. The pages go about bidding maids to the wake. Ellin
asks her mother if she may go. (This looks as if there had originally
been no convent in the ballad.) Her mother tells her to put on red gold
and be wary of Karl, he is so very tricky. When Ellin owns her
attachment, Karl whispers softly, Do not weep, but follow me. Horses
were ready at the portal--_black_ horses all!

Karl sprang from the bier, took Ellin, and made for the door. The nuns,
who stood reading in the choir, thought it was an angel that had
translated her, and wished one would come for them. Karl, with fifteen
men who were in waiting, carried Ellin home, and drank his bridal with
her.

#D#, from recent oral tradition. As Karl lay in his bed, he said, How
shall I get the fair maid out of the convent? His foster-mother heard
him, and recommended him to feign death and bid the fair maid to his
wake. The maid asked her father's leave to go, but he said, Nay, the
moment you are inside the door he will seize you by the foot. But when
the page, who had first come in blue, comes back in scarlet, she goes.
She stands at Karl's head and says, I never shall forget thee; at his
feet, "I wished thee well;" at his side, "Thou wast my dearest." Then
she turns and bids everybody good-night, but Karl seizes her, and calls
to his friends to come drink his bridal. We hear nothing of the convent
after the first stanza.

#E#, from oral tradition of another quarter. Karl consults his mother
how he shall get little Kirstin out of the convent, and receives the
same counsel. A page is sent to the convent, and asks who will come to
the wake now Herr Karl is dead? Little Kirstin, without application to
the prioress, goes to her mother, who does not forbid her, but warns her
that Karl will capture her as sure as she goes into the room.

    The maid has the door by the handle,
      And is wishing them all good-night;
    Young Karl, that lay a corpse on the bier,
      Sprang up and held her tight.

    'Why here's a board and benches,
      And there's no dead body here;
    This eve I'll drink my mead and wine,
      All with my Kirstin dear.

    'Why here's a board and beds too,
      And here there's nobody dead;
    To-morrow will I go to the priest,
      All with my plighted maid.'

#F#, another copy from recent tradition, was published in 1875, in
Kristensen's Jyske Folkeviser, II, 213, No 62, 'Vaagestuen.' There is no
word of a convent here. The story is made very short. Kirsten's mother
says she will be fooled if she goes to the wake. The last stanza,
departing from all other copies, says that when Kirsten woke in the
morning Karl was off.

#G.# 'Klosterranet,' Levninger, I, 23, No 4 (1780), Danske Viser, IV,
261, No 212, a very second-rate ballad, may have the praise of
preserving consistency and conventual discipline. The young lady does
not slip out to see her mother without leave asked and had. It is my
persuasion that the convent, with its little jest about the poor nuns,
is a later invention, and that #C# is a blending of two different
stories. In #G#, Herr Morten betroths Proud Adeluds, who is more
virtuous than rich. His friends object; her friends do not want spirit,
and swear that she shall never be his. Morten's father sends him out of
the country, and Adeluds is put into a convent. After nine years Morten
returns, and, having rejected an advantageous match proposed by his
father, advises with his brother, Herr Nilaus, how to get his true love
out of the cloister. The brother's plan is that of the mother and
foster-mother in the other versions. Herr Nilaus promises a rich gift if
Morten's body may be buried within the cloister. From this point the
story is materially the same as in #C#.

'Hertugen af Skage,' Danske Viser, II, 191, No 88, has this slight
agreement with the foregoing ballads. Voldemar, the king's youngest son,
hearing that the duke has a daughter, Hildegerd, that surpasses all
maids, seeks her out in a convent in which she has taken refuge, and
gets a cold reception. He feigns death, desiring that his bones may
repose in the cloister. His bier is carried into the convent church.
Hildegerd lights nine candles for him, and expresses compassion for his
early death. While she is standing before the altar of the Virgin,
Voldemar carries her out of the church by force.

This, says Afzelius, 1814, is one of the commonest ballads in #Sweden#,
and is often represented as a drama by young people in country places.

Rancken, N[oa]gra Prof af Folks[oa]ng, o. s. v., p. 13, No 4. These
differ but slightly from Danish #D#, #E#. All three conclude with the
humorous verses about the nuns, which in Rancken's copy take this
rollicking turn:

    And all the nuns in the convent they all danced in a ring;
    'Christ send another such angel, to take us all under his wing!'

    And all the nuns in the convent, they all danced each her lone;
    'Christ send another such angel, to take us off every one!'

Bergstr[:o]m, new Afzelius, II, 131, refers to another version in
Gyllenm[:a]rs' visbok, p. 191, and to a good copy obtained by himself.

An Icelandic version for the 17th century, which is after the fashion
of Danish #C#, #G#, is given in ['I]slenzk Fornkv[ae][dh]i, II, 59, No
40, 'Marteins kvi[dh]a.' The lover has in all three a troop of armed
men in waiting outside of the convent.

Professor Bugge has obtained a version in Norway, which, however, is as
to language essentially Danish. (Bergstr[:o]m, as above.)

There is a very gay and pretty south-European ballad, in which the
artifice of feigning death is successfully tried by a lover after the
failure of other measures.

translated by Aigner, Ungarische Volksdichtungen, p. 80, 'Sch[:o]n Anton.'
Handsome Tony tells his mother that he shall die for Helen. The mother
says, Not yet. I will build a marvellous mill. The first wheel shall
grind out pearls, the middle stone discharge kisses, the third wheel
distribute small change. The pretty maids will come to see, and Helen
among them. Helen asks her mother's leave to see the mill. "Go not," the
mother replies. "They are throwing the net, and a fox will be caught."
Tony again says he must die. His mother says, not yet; for she will
build an iron bridge; the girls will come to see it, and Helen among
them. Helen asks to see the bridge; her mother answers as before. Tony
says once more that he shall die for Helen. His mother again rejoins,
Not yet. Make believe to be dead; the girls will come to see you, and
Helen among them. Helen entreats to be allowed to go to see the handsome
young man that has died. Her mother tells her she will never come back.
Tony's mother calls to him to get up; the girl he was dying for is even
now before the gate, in the court, standing at his feet. "Never," says
Helen, "saw I so handsome a dead man,--eyes smiling, mouth tempting
kisses, and his feet all ready for a spring." Up he jumped and embraced
her.

#B.# #Italian.# Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, p. 59, No 40, 'Il
Genovese.' The Genoese, not obtaining the beautiful daughter of a rich
merchant on demand, plants a garden. All the girls come for flowers,
except the one desired. He then gives a ball, with thirty-two musicians.
All the girls are there, but not the merchant's daughter. He then builds
a church, very richly adorned. All the girls come to mass, all but one.
Next he sets the bells a ringing, in token of his death. The fair one
goes to the window to ask who is dead. The good people ("ra bun-ha
gent," in the Danish ballad "det gode folk") tell her that it is her
first love, and suggest that she should attend the funeral. She asks her
father, who consents if she will not cry. As she was leaving the church,
the lover came to life, and called to the priests and friars to stop
singing. They went to the high altar to be married.

mother," cries the love-sick youth, "that all who will may hear mass;
perhaps my love among them." The mother built a church, one and another
came, but not his love. "Dig a well, mother, that those who will may
fetch water; perhaps my love among them." The well was dug, one and
another came for water, but not his love. "Say I am dead, mother, that
those who will may come to pray." Those who wished came, his love first
of all. The youth was peeping through the window. "What kind of dead man
is this, that stretches his arms for an embrace, and puts out his mouth
for a kiss?"

        #b.# 'The Three Ravens,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
        Appendix, p. xviii, No XII.


#a# was printed from Melismata, by Ritson, in his Ancient Songs, 1790,
p. 155. Mr. Chappell remarked, about 1855, Popular Music of the Olden
Time, I, 59, that this ballad was still so popular in some parts of the
country that he had "been favored with a variety of copies of it,
written down from memory, and all differing in some respects, both as to
words and tune, but with sufficient resemblance to prove a similar
origin." Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxxvii, note 49, says
he had met with several copies almost the same as #a.# #b# is the first
stanza of one of these (traditional) versions, "very popular in
Scotland."

The following verses, first printed in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, and known in several versions in Scotland, are treated by
Motherwell and others as a traditionary form of 'The Three Ravens.' They
are, however, as Scott says, "rather a counterpart than a copy of the
other," and sound something like a cynical variation of the tender
little English ballad. Dr Rimbault (Notes and Queries, Ser. V, III, 518)
speaks of unprinted copies taken down by Mr Blaikie and by Mr Thomas
Lyle of Airth.

THE WHUMMIL BORE

        #a.# Motherwell's MS., p. 191. #b.# Motherwell's
        Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. xvi, No III.


This ballad, if it ever were one, seems not to have been met with, or at
least to have been thought worth notice, by anybody but Motherwell. As
already observed in the preface to 'Hind Horn,' stanza 2 seems to have
slipped into that ballad, in consequence of the resemblance of stanza 1
to #F# 2, #H# 3 of 'Hind Horn.' This first stanza is, however, a
commonplace in English and elsewhere: e. g., 'The Squire of Low Degree:'

    He served the kyng, her father dere,
    Fully the tyme of seven yere.      vv 5, 6.

    He loved her more then seven yere,
    Yet was he of her love never the nere.      vv 17, 18.

Motherwell informs us, Minstrelsy, p. xciv of Introduction, note to 141,
that 'Burd Helen and Young Tamlene' is very popular, and that various
sets of it are to be found traditionally current (1827). Still I have
not found it, out of Maidment's little book; not even in Motherwell's
large folio.

I cannot connect this fragment with what is elsewhere handed down
concerning Tamlane, or with the story of any other ballad.

THE BOY AND THE MANTLE

        Percy MS., p. 284. Hales & Furnivall, II, 304.


This ballad and the two which follow it are clearly not of the same
rise, and not meant for the same ears, as those which go before. They
would come down by professional rather than by domestic tradition,
through minstrels rather than knitters and weavers. They suit the hall
better than the bower, the tavern or public square better than the
cottage, and would not go to the spinning-wheel at all. An exceedingly
good piece of minstrelsy 'The Boy and the Mantle' is, too; much livelier
than most of the numerous variations on the somewhat overhandled
theme.[211]

Of these, as nearest related, the fabliau or "romance" of Le Mantel
Mautailli['e], 'Cort Mantel,' must be put first: Montaiglon et Raynaud,
Recueil G['e]n['e]ral des Fabliaux, III, 1, from four manuscripts, three of
the thirteenth century, one of the fourteenth; and previously by Michel,
from the three older manuscripts, in Wolf, Ueber die Lais, p. 324. A
rendering of the fabliau in prose, existing in a single manuscript, was
several times printed in the sixteenth century: given in Legrand, ed.
Renouard, I, 126, and before, somewhat modernized, by Caylus, 'Les
Manteaux,' [OE]uvres Badines, VI, 435.[212]

The story in 'Cort Mantel' goes thus. Arthur was holding full court at
Pentecost, never more splendidly. Not only kings, dukes, and counts were
there, but the attendance of all young bachelors had been commanded, and
he that had a _bele amie_ was to bring her. The court assembled on
Saturday, and on Sunday all the world went to church. After service the
queen took the ladies to her apartments, till dinner should be ready.
But it was Arthur's wont not to dine that day until he had had or heard
of some adventure;[213] dinner was kept waiting; and it was therefore
with great satisfaction that the knights saw a handsome and courteous
varlet arrive, who must certainly bring news; news that was not to be
good to all, though some would be pleased (cf. stanza 5 of the ballad).
A maid had sent him from a very distant country to ask a boon of the
king. He was not to name the boon or the lady till he had the king's
promise; but what he asked was no harm. The king having said that he
would grant what was asked, the varlet took from a bag a beautiful
mantle, of fairy workmanship. This mantle would fit no dame or damsel
who had in any way misbehaved towards husband or lover; it would be too
short or too long; and the boon was that the king should require all the
ladies of the court to put it on.

The ladies were still waiting dinner, unconscious of what was coming.
Gawain was sent to require their presence, and he simply told them that
the magnificent mantle was to be given to the one it best fitted. The
king repeated the assurance, and the queen, who wished much to win the
mantle, was the first to try it on. It proved too short. Ywain suggested
that a young lady who stood near the queen should try. This she readily
did, and what was short before was shorter still. Kay, who had been
making his comments unguardedly, now divulged the secret, and after that
nobody cared to have to do with the mantle. The king said, We may as
well give it back; but the varlet insisted on having the king's promise.
There was general consternation and bad humor.

Kay called his mistress, and very confidently urged her to put on the
mantle. She demurred, on the ground that she might give offence by
forwardness; but this roused suspicion in Kay, and she had no resource
but to go on. The mantle was again lamentably short. Bruns and Ydier let
loose some gibes. Kay bade them wait; he had hopes for them. Gawain's
_amie_ next underwent the test, then Ywain's, then Perceval's. Still a
sad disappointment. Many were the curses on the mantle that would fit
nobody, and on him that brought it. Kay takes the unlucky ladies, one
after the other, to sit with his mistress.

At this juncture Kay proposes that they shall have dinner, and continue
the experiment by and by. The varlet is relentless; but Kay has the
pleasure of seeing Ydier discomfited. And so they go on through the
whole court, till the varlet says that he fears he shall be obliged to
carry his mantle away with him. But first let the chambers be searched;
some one may be in hiding who may save the credit of the court. The king
orders a search, and they find one lady, not in hiding, but in her bed,
because she is not well. Being told that she must come, she presents
herself as soon as she can dress, greatly to the vexation of her lover,
whose name is Carados Briebras. The varlet explains to her the quality
of the mantle, and Carados, in verses very honorable to his heart, begs
that she will not put it on if she has any misgivings.[214] The lady
says very meekly that she dare not boast being better than other people,
but, if it so please her lord, she will willingly don the mantle. This
she does, and in sight of all the barons it is neither too short nor too
long. "It was well we sent for her," says the varlet. "Lady, your lover
ought to be delighted. I have carried this mantle to many courts, and of
more than a thousand who have put it on you are the only one that has
escaped disgrace. I give it to you, and well you deserve it." The king
confirms the gift, and no one can gainsay.

A Norse prose translation of the French fabliau was executed by order of
the Norwegian king, H['a]kon H['a]konarson, whose reign covers the years
1217-63. Of this translation, 'M[:o]ttuls Saga,' a fragment has come down
which is as old as 1300; there are also portions of a manuscript which
is assigned to about 1400, and two transcripts of this latter, made when
it was complete, besides other less important copies. This translation,
which is reasonably close and was made from a good exemplar, has been
most excellently edited by Messrs Cederschi[:o]ld and Wulff, Versions
nordiques du Fabliau Le Mantel Mautailli['e], Lund, 1877, p. 1.[215] It
presents no divergences from the story as just given which are material
here.

Not so with the 'Skikkju R['i]mur,' or Mantle Rhymes, an Icelandic
composition of the fifteenth century, in three parts, embracing in all
one hundred and eighty-five four-line stanzas: Cederschi[:o]ld and Wulff,
p. 51. In these the story is told with additions, which occur partially
in our ballad. The mantle is of white velvet. Three elf-women had been
not less than fifteen years in weaving it, and it seemed both yellow and
gray, green and black, red and blue: II, 22, 23, 26. Our English
minstrel describes these variations of color as occurring after Guenever
had put the mantle on: stanzas 11, 12. Again, there are among the
Pentecostal guests a king and queen of Dwarf Land; a beardless king of
Small-Maids Land, with a queen eight years old; and a King Felix, three
hundred years old, with a beard to the crotch, and a wife, tall and fat,
to whom he has been two centuries married,--all these severally attended
by generous retinues of pigmies, juveniles, and seniors: I, 28-35; III,
41. Felix is of course the prototype of the old knight pattering over a
creed in stanzas 21-24 of the ballad, and he will have his
representative in several other pieces presently to be spoken of. In the
end Arthur sends all the ladies from his court in disgrace, and his
knights to the wars; we will get better wives, he says: III, 74, 75.

The land of Small-Maids and the long-lived race are mentioned in a brief
geographical chapter (the thirteenth) of that singular gallimaufry the
saga of Samson the Fair, but not in connection with a probation by the
mantle, though this saga has appropriated portions of the story. Here
the mantle is one which four fairies have worked at for eighteen years,
as a penalty for stealing from the fleece of a very remarkable ram; and
it is of this same fleece, described as being of all hues, gold, silk,
_ok kolors_, that the mantle is woven. It would hold off from an
unchaste woman and fall off from a thief. Quintalin, to ransom his life,
undertakes to get the mantle for Samson. Its virtue is tried at two
weddings, the second being Samson's; and on this last occasion
Valentina, Samson's bride, is the only woman who can put it on. The
mantle is given to Valentina, as in the fabliau to Carados's wife, but
nevertheless we hear later of its being presented by Samson to another
lady, who, a good while after, was robbed of the same by a pirate, and
the mantle carried to Africa. From Africa it was sent to our Arthur by a
lady named Elida, "and hence the saga of the mantle."[216] Bj[:o]rner,
Nordiska K[:a]mpa Dater, cc 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24.

There is also an incomplete German version of the fabliau, now credibly
shown to be the work of Heinrich von dem T[:u]rlin, dating from the
earliest years of the thirteenth century.[217] Though the author has
dealt freely with his original, there are indications that this,
like the M[:o]ttulssaga, was founded upon some version of the fabliau
which is not now extant. One of these is an agreement between vv
574-6 and the sixth stanza of our ballad. The mantle, in English, is
enclosed between two nut-shells;[218] in German, the bag from which
it is taken is hardly a span wide. In the M[:o]ttulssaga, p. 9, l. 6,
the mantle comes from a p['u]ss, a small bag hanging on the belt; in
Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet, from ein m[ae]zigez teschel[^i]n,
and in the latter case the mantle instantaneously expands to full size
(Warnatsch); it is also of all colors known to man, vv 5807-19. Again,
when Guenever had put on the mantle, st. 10 of our ballad, "it was from
the top to the toe as sheeres had itt shread." So in 'Der Mantel,' vv
732, 733:

    Unde [==unten] het man in zerizzen,
    Oder mit mezzern zesnitten.[219]

The Lanzelet of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, dating from the first years of
the thirteenth century, with peculiarities of detail and a partially new
set of names, presents the outline of the same story. A sea-fairy sends
a maid to Arthur with a magnificent gift, which is, however, conditioned
upon his granting a boon. Arthur assents, and the maid takes, from a
small bag which she wears at her girdle, a mantle, which is of all
colors that man ever saw or heard of, and is worked with every manner of
beast, fowl, and strange fish. The king's promise obliges him to make
all the court ladies don the mantle, she to have it whom it perfectly
fits. More than two hundred try, and there is no absolute fit.[220] But
Iblis, Lanzelet's wife, is not present: she is languishing on account of
his absence on a dangerous adventure. She is sent for, and by general
agreement the mantle is, on her, the best-fitting garment woman ever
wore. Ed. Hahn, vv 5746-6135.

The adventure of the Mantle is very briefly reported to Gawain, when on
his way with Ydain to Arthur, by a youth who had just come from the
court, in terms entirely according with the French fabliau, in Messire
Gauvain, ou La Vengeance de Raguidel, by the trouv[e']re Raoul, ed.
Hippeau, p. 135 ff, vv 3906-55, and in the Dutch Lancelot, ed.
Jonckbloet, Part II, p. 85, vv 12,500-527, poems of the thirteenth
century. The one lady whom the mantle fits is in the latter Carados
vrindinne, in the other l'amie Caraduel Briefbras.

The Scalachronica, by Sir Thomas Gray of Heton, a chronicle of England
and Scotland, 1066-1362, begun in 1355, gives the analysis of many
romances, and that of the adventure of the Mantle in this form. There
was sent to Arthur's court the mantle of Karodes, which was of such
virtue that it would fit no woman who was not willing that her husband
should know both her act and her thought.[221] This was the occasion of
much mirth, for the mantle was either too short, or too long, or too
tight, for all the ladies except Karodes' wife. And it was said that
this mantle was sent by the father of Karodes, a magician, to prove the
goodness of his son's wife.[222]

Two fifteenth-century German versions of the Mantle story give it a
shape of their own. In Fastnachtspiele aus dem f[:u]nfzehnten Jahrhundert,
II, 665, No 81, 'Der Luneten Mantel,' the amiable Lunet, so well and
favorably known in romances, takes the place of the English boy and
French varlet. The story has the usual course. The mantle is
unsuccessfully tried by Arthur's queen, by the wife of the Greek
emperor, and by the queen of Lorraine. The king of Spain, who announces
himself as _the oldest man_ present, is willing to excuse his wife, who
is the youngest of the royal ladies. She says, If we lack lands and
gold, "so sei wir doch an eren reich," offers herself to the test with
the fearlessness of innocence, and comes off clear, to the delight of
her aged spouse. A meistergesang, Bruns, Beitr[:a]ge zur kritischen
Bearbeitung alter Handschriften, p. 143,[223] 'Lanethen Mantel,' again
awards the prize to the young wife of a very old knight. Laneth, a clean
maid, who is Arthur's niece, having made herself poor by her bounty, is
cast off by her uncle's wife and accused of loose behavior. She makes
her trouble known to a dwarf, a good friend of her father's, and
receives from him a mantle to take to Arthur's court: if anybody huffs
her, she is to put it to use. The queen opens upon Laneth, as soon as
she appears, with language not unlike that which she employs of
Cradock's wife in stanzas 33, 34 of the ballad. The mantle is offered to
any lady that it will fit. In front it comes to the queen's knee, and it
drags on the ground behind. Three hundred and fifty knights' ladies fare
as ill as the sovereign.[224]

The Dean of Lismore's collection of Gaelic poetry, made in the early
part of the sixteenth century, contains a ballad, obscure in places, but
clearly presenting the outlines of the English ballad or French
fabliau.[225] Finn, Diarmaid, and four other heroes are drinking, with
their six wives. The women take too much, and fall to boasting of their
chastity. While they are so engaged, a maid approaches who is clad in a
seamless robe of pure white. She sits down by Finn, and he asks her what
is the virtue of the garment. She replies that her seamless robe will
completely cover none but the spotless wife. Conan, a sort of Kay, says,
Give it to my wife at once, that we may learn the truth of what they
have been saying. The robe shrinks into folds, and Conan is so angry
that he seizes his spear and kills his wife.[226] Diarmaid's wife tries,
and the robe clings about her hair; Oscar's, and it does not reach to
her middle; Maighinis, Finn's wife, and it folds around her ears.
MacRea's wife only is completely covered. The 'daughter of Deirg,'
certainly a wife of Finn, and here seemingly to be identified with
Maighinis, claims the robe: she has done nothing to be ashamed of; she
has erred only with Finn. Finn curses her and womankind, "because of her
who came that day."

The probation by the Horn runs parallel with that by the Mantle, with
which it is combined in the English ballad. Whether this or that is the
anterior creation it is not possible to say, though the 'Lai du Corn'
is, beyond question, as Ferdinand Wolf held, of a more original stamp,
fresher and more in the popular vein than the fabliau of the Mantle, as
we have it.[227] The 'Lai du Corn,' preserved in a single not very early
manuscript (Digby 86, Bodleian Library, "of the second half of the
thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century"), may well belong,
where Wolf puts it, in the middle of the twelfth. Robert Bikez, the
jongleur who composed it, attributes the first authorship to "Garadue,"
the hero, and says that he himself derived the story from the oral
communication of an abb['e]. Arthur has assembled thirty thousand knights
at a feast at Pentecost, and each of them is paired with a lady. Before
dinner there arrives a donzel, with an ivory horn adorned with four gold
bands and rich jewels. This horn has been sent Arthur by Mangounz, king
of Moraine. The youth is told to take his place before the king, who
promises to knight him after dinner and give him a handsome present the
next day; but he laughingly excuses himself, on the ground that it is
not proper for a squire to eat at a knight's table, and retires. Arthur
sees that there is an inscription on the horn, and desires that his
"chapelein" may read it. Everybody is eager to hear, but some repent
afterwards. The horn was made by a fairy, who endued it with this
quality, that no man should drink of it without spilling, if his wife
had not been true in act and thought. Even the queen hung her head, and
so did all the barons that had wives. The maids jested, and looked at
their lovers with "Now we shall see." Arthur was offended, but ordered
Kay to fill. The king drank and spilled; seized a knife, and was about
to strike the queen, but was withheld by his knights. Gawain gallantly
came to the queen's vindication. "Be not such a churl," he said, "for
there is no married woman but has her foolish thought." The queen
demanded an ordeal by fire: if a hair of her were burned, she would be
torn by horses. She confessed that the horn was in so far right that she
had once given a ring to a youth who had killed a giant that had accused
Gawain of treason, etc. She thought this youth would be a desirable
addition to the court. Arthur was not convinced: he would make everybody
try the horn now, king, duke, and count, for he would not be the only
one to be shamed. Eleven kings, thirty counts, all who essay, spill:
they are very angry, and bid the devil take him who brought and him who
sent the horn. When Arthur saw this, he began to laugh: he regarded the
horn as a great present, he said, and he would part with it to nobody
except the man that could drink out of it. The queen blushed so prettily
that he kissed her three times, and asked her pardon for his bad humor.
The queen said, Let everybody take the horn, small and great. There was
a knight who was the happiest man in all the court, the least a
braggart, the most mannerly, and the most redoubtable after Gawain. His
name was Garadue, and he had a wife, _mout leal_, who was a fairy for
beauty, and surpassed by none but the queen. Garadue looked at her. She
did not change color. "Drink," she said; "indeed, you are at fault to
hesitate." She would never have husband but him: for a woman should be a
dove, and accept no second mate. Garadue was naturally very much
pleased: he sprang to his feet, took the horn, and, crying Wassail! to
the king, drank out every drop. Arthur presented him with Cirencester,
and, for his wife's sake, with the horn, which was exhibited there on
great days.

The romance of Perceval le Gallois, by Chrestien de Troyes and others
(second half of the twelfth century), describes Arthur, like the
fabliau, as putting off dinner till he should hear of some strange news
or adventure. A knight rides into the hall, with an ivory horn,
gold-banded and richly jewelled, hanging from his neck, and presents it
to the king. Have it filled with pure water, says the bearer, and the
water will turn to the best wine in the world, enough for all who are
present. "A rich present!" exclaims Kay. But no knight whose wife or
love has betrayed him shall drink without spilling. "Or empire vostre
pr['e]sens," says Kay. The king has the horn filled, and does not heed
Guenever, who begs him not to drink, for it is some enchantment, to
shame honest folk. "Then I pray God," says the queen, "that if you try
to drink you may be wet." The king essays to drink, and Guenever has her
prayer. Kay has the same luck, and all the knights,[228] till the horn
comes to Carados (Brisi['e]-Bras). Carados, as in the lai, hesitates; his
wife (Guinon, Guimer) looks at him, and says, Drink! He spills not a
drop. Guenever and many a dame hate nothing so much as her. Perceval le
Gallois, ed. Potvin, II, 216 ff, vv 15,640-767.[229]

The story of 'Le Livre de Carados,' in Perceval, is given in abridgment
by the author of Le Roman du Renard contrefait, writing in the second
half of the fourteenth century: Tarb['e], Po[e']tes de Champagne
ant['e]rieurs au si[e']cle de Fran[c,]ois I^{er}, Histoire de Quarados
Brun-Bras, p. 79 ff. The horn here becomes a cup.

A meistergesang, entitled 'Dis ist Frauw Tristerat Horn von Saphoien,'
and found in the same fifteenth-century manuscript as Der Lanethen
Mantel, Bruns, as before, p. 139, preserves many features of the lai.
While Arthur is at table with seven other kings and their wives, a
damsel comes, bringing an ivory horn, with gold letters about the rim, a
present from Frau Tristerat of Savoy. The king sends for a clerk to read
the inscription, and declares he will begin the experiment. The damsel
prudently retires. Arthur is thoroughly wet, and on the point of
striking the queen, but is prevented by a knight. The seven kings then
take the horn, one after the other. Six of them fare like Arthur. The
king of Spain looks at his wife, fearing shame. She encourages him to
drink, saying, as in the other meistergesang, If we are poor in goods,
we are rich in honor. Arthur presents him with the horn, and adds cities
and lands. Another copy of this piece was printed by Zingerle, in
Germania, V, 101, 'Das goldene Horn.' The queen is aus der Syrenen
lant.[230]

A fastnachtspiel gives substantially the same form to the story: Keller,
Nachlese, No 127, p. 183. Arthur invites seven kings and queens to his
court. His wife wishes him to ask his sister, the Queen of Cyprus, also;
but she has offended him, and he cannot be prevailed upon to do it. The
Queen of Cyprus sends the horn to Arthur by her maid as a gift from a
queen who is to be nameless, and in fulfilling her charge the messenger
describes her lady simply as a sea princess. The inscription is read
aloud by one of Arthur's knights. The King of Spain carries off the
honors, and receives in gift, besides the horn, a ducal crown, and gold
to boot. Arthur resolves that the horn shall be forgotten, and no grudge
borne against the women, and proposes a dance, which he leads off with
his wife.[231]

We have Arthur joining in a dance under nearly the same circumstances
in an English "bowrd" found in a MS. of about the middle of the
fifteenth century (Ashmolean Museum, No 61). The king has a bugle
horn, which always stands before him, and often amuses himself by
experimenting with it. Those who cannot drink without spilling are
set at a table by themselves, with willow garlands on their heads,
and served with the best. Upon the occasion of a visit from the Duke
of Gloucester, the king, wishing to entertain his guest with an
exhibition of the property of the horn, says he will try all who are
present. He begins himself, as he was wont to do, but this time spills.
He takes the mishap merrily, and says he may now join in a dance
which the "freyry" were to have after meat. 'The Cokwolds Daunce,'
Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales, p. 209; Karajan, Fr[:u]hlingsgabe
[Schatzgr[:a]ber], p. 17; Hazlitt, Remains of Early Popular Poetry, I,
38.[232]

Heinrich von dem T[:u]rl[^i]n narrates the episode of the probation by the
Horn with many variations of his own, among them the important one of
subjecting the women to the test as well as the men.[233] In his Cr[^o]ne,
put at 1200-10, a misshapen, dwarfish knight, whose skin is overgrown
with scales, riding on a monster who is fish before and dolphin behind,
with wings on its legs, presents himself to Arthur on Christmas Day as
an envoy from a sea king, who offers the British monarch a gift on
condition of his first granting a boon. The gift is a cup, made by a
necromancer of Toledo, of which no man or woman can drink who has been
false to love, and it is to be the king's if there shall be anybody at
the court who can stand the test. The ladies are sent for, and the
messenger gives the cup first to them. They all spill. The knights
follow, Arthur first; and he, to the general astonishment, bears the
proof, which no one else does except the sea king's messenger.
Caraduz[234] von Caz fails with the rest. Diu Cr[^o]ne, ed. Scholl, vv
466-3189.

The prose Tristan confines the proof to the women, and transfers the
scene to King Mark's court. Morgan the Fay having sent the enchanted
horn to Arthur's court by the hands of a damsel, to avenge herself on
Guenever, two knights who had a spite against Mark and Tristan intercept
it, and cause the horn to be taken to King Mark, who is informed that no
lady that has been false to her lord can drink of it without spilling.
Yseult spills, and the king says she deserves to die. But, fortunately
or unfortunately, all the rest of the ladies save four are found to be
in the same plight as the queen. The courtiers, resolved to make the
best of a bad matter, declare that they have no confidence in the
probation, and the king consents to treat the horn as a deception, and
acquits his wife.[235]

Ariosto has introduced the magical vessel made by Morgan the Fay for
Arthur's behoof[236] into Orlando Furioso. A gentleman tries it on his
guests for ten years, and they all spill but Rinaldo, who declines il
periglioso saggio: canto XLII, 70-73, 97-104; XLIII, 6-44. Upon
Ariosto's narrative La Fontaine founded the tale and the comedy of 'La
Coupe Enchant['e]e,' Works ed. Moland, IV, 37, V, 361.

In a piece in the Wunderhorn, I, 389, ed. 1819, called 'Die
Ausgleichung,' and purporting to be from oral tradition, but reading
like an imitation, or at most a reconstruction, of a meistergesang, the
cup and mantle are made to operate conjointly: the former to convict a
king and his knights, the other a queen and her ladies, of
unfaithfulness in love. Only the youngest of the ladies can wear the
mantle, and only the oldest of the knights, to whom she is espoused, can
drink from the cup. This knight, on being presented with the cup, turns
into a dwarf; the lady, on receiving the gift of the mantle, into a fay.
They pour a drop of wine from the cup upon the mantle, and give the
mantle to the queen, and the cup, empty, to the king. After this, the
king and all the world can drink without inconvenience, and the mantle
fits every woman. But the stain on the mantle grows bigger every year,
and the cup gives out a hollow sound like tin! An allegory, we may
suppose, and, so far as it is intelligible, of the weakest sort.

Tegau Eurvron is spoken of in Welsh triads as one of the three chaste
ladies, and again as one of the three fair ladies, of Arthur's
court.[237] She is called the wife of Caradawe Vreichvras by various
Welsh writers, and by her surname of "Gold-breasted" she should be
so.[238] If we may trust the author of The Welsh Bards, Tegau was the
possessor of three treasures or rarities "which befitted none but
herself," a mantle, a goblet, and a knife. The mantle is mentioned in a
triad,[239] and is referred to as having the variable hue attributed to
it in our ballad and elsewhere. There are three things, says the triad,
of which no man knows the color; the peacock's expanded tail, the mantle
of Tegau Eurvron, and the miser's pence. Of this mantle, Jones, in whose
list of "Thirteen Rarities of Kingly Regalia" of the Island of Britain
it stands eleventh, says, No one could put it on who had dishonored
marriage, nor a young damsel who had committed incontinence; but it
would cover a chaste woman from top to toe: Welsh Bards, II, 49. The
mantle certainly seems to be identified by what is said of its color in
the (not very ancient) triad, and so must have the property attributed
to it by Jones, but one would be glad to have had Jones cite chapter and
verse for his description.

There is a drinking-horn among the Thirteen Precious Things of the
Island of Britain, which, like the conjurer's bottle of our day, will
furnish any liquor that is called for, and a knife which will serve
four-and-twenty men at meat "all at once." How this horn and this knife
should befit none but the chaste and lovely Tegau, it is not easy to
comprehend. Meanwhile the horn and the knife are not the property of
Cradock's wife, in the English ballad: the horn falls to Cradock of
right, and the knife was his from the beginning. Instead of Tegau's
mantle we have in another account a mantle of Arthur, which is the
familiar cloak that allows the wearer to see everything without himself
being seen. Not much light, therefore, but rather considerable mist,
comes from these Welsh traditions, of very uncertain date and
significance. It may be that somebody who had heard of the three Welsh
rarities, and of the mantle and horn as being two of them, supposed that
the knife must have similar virtues with the horn and mantle, whence its
appearance in our ballad; but no proof has yet been given that the Welsh
horn and knife had ever a power of testing chastity.[240]

Heinrich von dem T[:u]rlin, not satisfied with testing Arthur's court first
with the mantle, and again with the horn, renews the experiment with a
Glove, in a couple of thousand lines more of tedious imitation of 'Cort
Mantel,'[241] Cr[^o]ne, 22,990-24,719. This glove renders the right side of
the body invisible, when put on by man or woman free of blame, but
leaves in the other case some portion of that side visible and bare. A
great many ladies and knights don the glove, and all have reason to
regret the trial except Arthur and Gawain.[242]

There is another German imitation of the fabliau of the mantle, in the
form (1) of a farce of the fifteenth century and (2) of a meistergesang
printed in the sixteenth. In these there is substituted for the mantle a
Crown that exposes the infidelity of husbands.

1. "Das Vasnachtspil mit der Kron."[243] A "master" has been sent to
Arthur's court with a rich crown, which the King of Abian wishes to
present to whichever king or lord it shall fit, and it will fit only
those who have not "lost their honor." The King of Orient begins the
trial, very much against his will: the crown turns to ram's horns. The
King of Cyprus is obliged to follow, though he says the devil is in the
crown: the crown hangs about his neck. Appeals are made to Arthur that
the trial may now stop, so that the knights may devote themselves to the
object for which they had come together, the service and honor of the
ladies. But here Lanet, Arthur's sister (so she is styled), interposes,
and expresses a hope that no honors are intended the queen, for she is
not worthy of them, having broken her faith. Arthur is very angry, and
says that Lanet has by her injurious language forfeited all her lands,
and shall be expelled from court. (Cf. Der Lanethen Mantel, p. 261.) A
knight begs the king to desist, for he who heeds every tale that is told
of his wife shall never be easy.

2. The meistergesang 'Die Krone der K[:o]nigin von Afion.'[244] While his
majesty of Afion is holding a great feast, a youth enters the hall
bearing a splendid crown, which has such chaste things in it that no
king can wear it who haunts false love. The crown had been secretly made
by order of the queen. The king wishes to buy the crown at any price,
but the youth informs him that it is to be given free to the man who can
wear it. The king asks the favor of being the first to try the crown:
when put on his head it falls down to his back. The King of Portugal is
eager to be next: the crown falls upon his shoulder. The King of Holland
at first refuses to put on the crown, for there was magic in it, and it
was only meant to shame them: but he is obliged to yield, and the crown
goes to his girdle. The King of Cyprus offers himself to the adventure:
the crown falls to his loins. And so with eleven. But there was a "Young
Philips," King of England, who thought he might carry off the prize. His
wife was gray and old and ugly, and quite willing, on this account, to
overlook e bisserle Falschheit, and told him that he might spare
himself. But he would not be prevented; so they put the crown on him,
and it fitted to a hair. This makes an edifying pendant to 'Der Luneten
Mantel,' p. 261.

Still another imitation is the Magical Bridge in the younger Titurel
which Klingsor throws over the Sibra. Knights and ladies assembled at
Arthur's court, if less than perfect[245], on attempting to ride over it
are thrown off into the water, or stumble and fall on the bridge: ed.
Hahn, p. 232 ff, st. 2337 ff. Hans Sachs has told this story twice, with
Virgil for the magician: ed. Keller, Historia, K[:o]nig Artus mit der
ehbrecher-brugk, II, 262; Goedeke, Dichtungen von Hans Sachs, I, 175.
Kirchhof follows Hans Sachs in a story in Wendunmuth, ed. [:O]sterley, II,
38.

Florimel's Girdle, in the fourth book of the 'Fairy Queen,' canto v,
once more, is formed on the same pattern.[246]

There might be further included in imitations of the horn or mantle
test several other inventions which are clearly, as to form, modelled
on this original, but which have a different object: the valley from
which no false lover could escape till it had been entered by one "qui
de nulle chose auroit vers s'amie faus['e] ne mespris, n[e'] d'euvre
n[e'] de pens['e]e n[e'] de talent," the prose Lancelot in Jonckbloet,
II, lxix (Warnatsch), Ferrario, Storia ed Analisi, Lancilotto del Lago,
III, 372, Legrand, Fabliaux, I, 156; the arch in Amadis, which no man
or woman can pass who has been unfaithful to a first love, and again,
the sword which only the knight who loves his lady best can draw, and
the partly withered garland which becomes completely fresh on the head
of the lady who best loves her husband or lover, Amad['i]s de Gaula, l.
ii, introduccion, c. 1, c. 14, and ballad 1890 in Duran, II, 665; the
cup of congealed tears in Palmerin of England, which liquefies in the
hand of the best knight and faithfulest lover, chapters 87-89, II, 322
ff, ed. of London, 1807.

Besides those which have been spoken of, not a few other criterions of
chastity occur in romantic tales.

#Bed clothes and bed.# 'Gil Brenton,' #A#, #B#; the corresponding
Swedish ballad, #A#, #B#, #E#; Danish, Grundtvig, No 275:[247] see pp
64, 65, of this volume.

#A stepping-stone# by the bed-side. 'Vesle Aase Gaasepige,' Asbj[/o]rnsen
og Moe, No 29: see p. 66.

A chair in which no leal maiden can sit, or will sit till bidden (?).
'Gil Brenton,' #D#, #C#.

#Flowers# [foliage]. 1. In the Sanskrit story of Guhasena, the
merchant's son, and Devasmit['a], this married pair, who are to be
separated for a time, receive from Sh['i]va each a red lotus: if either
should be unfaithful, the lotus in the hand of the other would fade,
but not otherwise: Kath['a] Sarit S['a]gara, ch. 13, Tawney, I, 86,
Brockhaus, I, 137. 2. In the Tales of a Parrot, a soldier, going into
service, receives from his wife a rose [flower, nosegay], which will
keep fresh as long as she remains true: Rosen, Tuti-nameh, from the
Turkish version, I, 109; Wickerhauser, also from the Turkish, p. 57;
Iken, p. 30,[248] from the Persian of Kadiri. 3. So the knight Margon
in the French romance of Perceforest, vol. IV, ch. 16 and 17. 4. In
a Turkish tale found in a manuscript collection called 'Joy after
Sorrow,' an architect or housewright, having to leave home for want of
employment, is presented by his wife with a bunch of evergreen of the
same property. 5. An English story of a wright reverts to the rose.
A widow, having nothing else to give with her daughter, presents the
bridegroom with a rose-garland, which will hold its hue while his wife
is "stable:" 'The Wright's Chaste Wife,' by Adam of Cobsam, from a
manuscript of about 1462, ed. Furnivall.[249]

#A shirt# [mantle]. 1. In connection with the same incidents there is
substituted for the unfading flower, in Gesta Romanorum, 69, a shirt.
This a knight's wife gives to a carpenter or housewright who has married
her daughter, and it will not need washing, will not tear, wear, or
change color, as long as both husband and wife are faithful, but will
lose all its virtues if either is untrue. The shirt is given by a wife
to a husband in several versions of an otherwise different story. 2. In
the German meistergesang and the Flemish tale Alexander of Metz: K[:o]rner,
Historische Volkslieder, p. 49, No 8; Goedeke, Deutsche Dichtung im
Mittelalter, 2d ed., p. 569 ff; 'De Historia van Florentina,' etc., Van
den Bergh, De nederlandsche Volksromaus, p. 52 f. 3. In the story 'Von
dem K[:o]nig von Spanien[250] und seiner Frau,' M[:u]llenhoff, Sagen, u. s.
w., p. 586, No 607, a wife gives the shirt to her husband the morning
after the wedding: it will always be white until she dies, when it will
turn black, or unless she misbehaves, in which case it will be spotted.
4. 'Die getreue Frau,' Pl[:o]nnies, in Wolf's Zeitschrift f[:u]r deutsche
Mythologie,' II, 377. An English princess gives her consort, a Spanish
prince, at parting, a white shirt which will not spot as long as she is
faithful. 5. 'Die treue Frau,' Curtze, Volks[:u]berlieferungen aus Waldeck,
p. 146. A merchant's son, married to a princess, goes away for a voyage;
they change rings and shirts, and neither shirt will soil until one of
the two shall be untrue. 6. 'Die getreue Frau,' J. W. Wolf, Deutsche
Hausm[:a]rchen, at p. 102. A prince, going on a voyage, gives his sword to
his wife; as long as the blade is not spotted, he is faithful. He
receives from the princess a mantle; as long as it is white, her faith
is inviolate.

#A picture.# For the rose, as in Perceforest, there is substituted, in
a story otherwise essentially the same, a picture. A knight, compelled
to leave his wife, receives from a magician a picture of her, small
enough to carry in a box about his person, which will turn yellow if
she is tempted, pale if she wavers, black if she yields, but will
otherwise preserve its fresh hues: Bandello, Part I, nov. 21. This
tale, translated in Painter's Palace of Pleasure, 1567 (ed. Haslewood,
II, 471, nov. 28), furnished the plot for Massinger's 'Picture,' 1630.
The miniature will keep its color as long as the woman is innocent and
unattempted, will grow yellow if she is solicited but unconquered, and
black if she surrenders: Act I, Scene 1. Bandello's story is also the
foundation of S['e]nec['e]'s tale, 'Filer le parfait amour,' with a wax
image taking the place of the picture: [OE]uvres Choisies, ed. Charles
et Cap, p. 95.[251]

#A ring.# The picture is exchanged for a ring in a French tale derived,
and in parts almost translated, from Bandello's: the sixth in 'Les
Faveurs et les Disgraces de l'Amour,' etc., said to have appeared in
1696.[252] A white stone set in the ring may become yellow or black
under circumstances. Such a ring Rimnild gave Horn Child: when the stone
should grow wan, her thoughts would have changed; should it grow red,
she is no more a maid: see p. 192. A father, being required to leave
three daughters, gives them each such a ring in Basile, Pentamerone,
III, 4. The rings are changed into glass distaffs in 'L'Adroite
Princesse,' an imitation of this story by Mlle. Lh['e]ritier de Villaudon,
which has sometimes been printed with Perrault's tales: Perrault, Contes
des F['e]es, ed. Giraud, p. 239; Dunlop, ch. 13.

#A mirror#, in the History of Prince Zeyn Alasnam, reflecting the image
of a chaste maid, will remain unblurred: Arabian Nights, Scott, IV, 120,
124; 1001 Nacht, Habicht, VI, 146, 150; etc. Virgil made a mirror of
like property; it exposed the woman that was "new-fangle," wandelm[:u]etic,
by the ignition of a "worm" in the glass: Meisterlieder der Kolmarer
Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 605 (Warnatsch). There is also one of these
mirrors in Primaleon, l. ii, cap. 27; Rajna, Le Fonti dell' Orlando
Furioso, p. 504, note 3. Alfred de Musset, in 'Barberine,' substitutes a
pocket-mirror for the picture in Bandello, Part I, nov. 21: [OE]uvres
Compl[e']tes, III, 378 ff.

#A harp#, in the hands of an image, upon the approach of a
_despucell['e]e_, plays out of tune and breaks a string: Perceval le
Gallois, II, 149, vv 13, 365-72 (Rajna, as above).

A crystal #brook#, in the amiral's garden in Flor and Blancheflor, when
crossed by a virgin remains pellucid, but in the other case becomes red,
or turbid: ed. Du M['e]ril, p. 75, vv 1811-14; Bekker, Berlin Academy,
XLIV, 26, vv 2069-72; Fleck, ed. Sommer, p. 148, vv 4472-82; Swedish,
ed. Klemming, p. 38, 1122-25; Lower Rhine, Haupt's Zeitschrift, XXI,
321, vv 57-62; Middle Greek, Bekker, Berlin Academy, 1845, p. 165,
Wagner, Medi[ae]val Greek Texts, p. 40 f, vv 1339-48; etc. In the English
poem, Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales, p. 93, if a clean maid wash
her hands in the water, it remains quiet and clear; but if one who has
lost her purity do this, the water will yell like mad and become red as
blood.

The #stone# Aptor, in Wigamur, vv 1100-21, is red to the sight of clean
man or woman, but misty to others: Von der Hagen und B[:u]sching, Deutsche
Gedichte des Mittelalters, p. 12 (Warnatsch).[253]

A #statue#, in an Italian ballad, moved its eyes when young women who
had sacrificed their honor were presented to it: Ferraro, Canti
popolari di Ferrara, Cento e Pontelagoscuro, p. 84, 'Il Conte
Cagnolino.' There was said to be a statue of Venus in Constantinople
which could not be approached by an incontinent woman without a very
shameful exposure; and again, a pillar surmounted by four horns, which
turned round three times if any [Gk: keratas] came up to it.[254]
Virgil, 'Filius,' made a brass statue which no misbehaving woman might
touch, and a vicious one received violent blows from it: Meisterlieder
der Kolmarer Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 604, 14th century. This statue
would bite off the fingers of an adulteress if they were put in its
mouth, according to a poem of the same century published by Bartsch in
Germania, IV, 237; and a third version makes the statue do this to _all_
perjurers, agreeing in other respects with the second: Kolmarer
Meisterlieder, as before, p. 338. In the two last the offence of the
wife causes a horn to grow out of the husband's forehead. Much of the
story in these poems is derived from the fifteenth tale of the
Shukasaptati, where a woman offers to pass between the legs of a statue
of a Yaksha, which only an innocent one can do: Benfey, Pantschatantra,
I, 457.[255]

According to a popular belief in Austria, says J. Grimm, you may know a
clean maid by her being able to blow out a candle with one puff and to
light it again with another. The phrase was known in Spain: "Matar un
candil con un soplo y encenderlo con otro." Grimm adds that it is an
article of popular faith in India that a virgin can make a ball of
water, or carry water in a sieve: Rechtsalterth[:u]mer, p. 932.[256]

An ordeal for chastity is a feature in several of the Greek romances. In
Heliodorus's [AE]thiopica, X, 8, 9, victims to be offered to the sun and
moon, who must be pure, are obliged to mount a #brazier# covered with a
golden grating. The soles of those who are less than perfect are burned.
Theagenes and Chariclea experience no inconvenience. The Clitophon and
Leucippe of Achilles Tatius, VIII, 6, 13, 14, has a #cave# in the grove
of Diana of Ephesus, in which they shut up a woman. If it is a virgin, a
delicious melody is presently heard from a syrinx, the doors open of
themselves, and the woman comes out crowned with pine leaves; if not a
virgin, a wail is heard, and the woman is never seen again. There is
also a not perfectly convincing trial, by the Stygian #water#, in [S] 12,
which seems to be imitated in the Hysmine and Hysminias of Eustathius
[Eumathius], VIII, 7, XI, 17. In the temple of Diana, at Artycomis,
stands a statue of the goddess, with bow in hand, and from about her
feet flows water like a roaring river. A woman, crowned with laurel,
being put in, she will float quietly, if all is right; but should she
not have kept her allegiance to Dian, the goddess bends her bow as if to
shoot at her head, which causes the culprit to duck, and the water
carries off her wreath.[257]

It is prescribed in Numbers v, 11-31, that any man jealous of his wife
may bring her to the priest, who shall, with and after various
ceremonies, give her a bitter drink of holy water in which dust from the
floor of the tabernacle has been infused. If she have trespassed, her
body shall swell and rot. In the Pseudo-Matthew's Gospel, ch. xii,
Joseph and Mary successively take this aquam potationis domini. No
pretender to innocence could taste this and then make seven turns round
the altar, without some sign of sin appearing in the face. The
experiment shows both to be faultless. So, with some variation, the
sixteenth chapter of the Protevangelium of James. This trial is the
subject of one of the Coventry Mysteries, No 14, p. 137 ff, ed.
Halliwell, and no doubt of other scripture plays. It is naturally
introduced into Wernher's Maria, Hoffmann, Fundgruben, II, 188, line 26
ff, and probably into other lives of the Virgin.

Herodotus relates, II, 111, that Pheron, son of Sesostris, after a
blindness of ten years' duration, received an intimation from an oracle
that he would recover his sight upon following a certain prescription,
such as we are assured is still thought well of in Egypt in cases of
ophthalmia. For this the co[:o]peration of a chaste woman was
indispensable. Repeatedly balked, the king finally regained his vision,
and collecting in a town many women of whom he had vainly hoped aid, in
which number his queen was included, he set fire to the place and burned
both it and them, and then married the woman to whom he was so much
indebted. (First cited in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1795, vol. 65, I,
114.) The coincidence with foregoing tales is certainly curious, but to
all appearance accidental.[258]

The 'Boy and the Mantle' was printed "verbatim" from his manuscript by
Percy in the Reliques, III, 3, ed. 1765. The copy at p. 314 is of course
the same "revised and altered" by Percy, but has been sometimes mistaken
for an independent one.

      _tha_t hath once done amisse:'
    Then euery k_nigh_t in the k_ing_s court
      began to care for his.

    9
    Forth came dame Gueneuer,
      to the mantle shee her bed;
    The ladye shee was new-fangle,
      but yett shee was affrayd.

    10
    When shee had taken the mantle,
      shee stoode as she had beene madd;
    It was from the top to the toe
      as sheeres had itt shread.

    11
    One while was itt gaule,
      another while was itt greene;
    Another while was itt wadded;
      ill itt did her beseeme.

    12
    Another while was it blacke,
      and bore the worst hue;
    'By my troth,' q_uo_th K_ing_ Arthur,
      'I thinke thou be not true.'

    13
    Shee threw downe the mantle,
      _tha_t bright was of blee,
    Fast with a rudd redd
      to her chamber can shee flee.

    14
    Shee curst the weauer and the walker
      that clothe _tha_t had wrought,
    And bade a vengeance on his crowne
      _tha_t hither hath itt brought.

    15
    'I had rather be in a wood,
      vnder a greene tree,
    Then in K_ing_ Arthurs court
      shamed for to bee.'

    16
    Kay called forth his ladye,
      and bade her come neere;
    Saies, 'Madam, and thou be guiltye,
      I pray thee hold thee there.'

    17
    Forth came his ladye
      shortlye and anon,
    Boldlye to the mantle
      then is shee gone.

    18
    When she had tane the mantle,
      and cast it her about,
    Then was shee bare
      all aboue the buttocckes.

    19
    Then euery knight
      _tha_t was in the kings court
    Talked, laughed, and showted,
      full oft att _tha_t sport.

    20
    Shee threw downe the mantle,
      _tha_t bright was of blee,
    Ffast with a red rudd
      to her chamber can shee flee.

    21
    Forth came an old k_night_,
      pattering ore a creede,
    And he _pro_ferred to this little boy
      twenty markes to his meede,

    22
    And all the time of the Christmasse
      willinglye to ffeede;
    For why, this mantle might
      doe his wiffe some need.

    23
    When shee had tane the mantle,
      of cloth _tha_t was made,
    Shee had no more left on her
      but a tassell and a threed:
    Then euery k_night_ in the k_ing_s court
      bade euill might shee speed.

    24
    Shee threw downe the mantle,
      _tha_t bright was of blee,
    And fast w_i_th a redd rudd
      to her chamber can shee flee.

    25
    Craddocke called forth his ladye,
      and bade her come in;
    Saith, 'Winne this mantle, ladye,
      with a litle dinne.

    26
    'Winne this mantle, ladye,
      and it shalbe thine
    If thou neuer did amisse
      since thou wast mine.'

    27
    Forth came Craddockes ladye
      shortlye and anon,
    But boldlye to the mantle
      then is shee gone.

    28
    When shee had tane the mantle,
      and cast itt her about,
    Vpp att her great toe
      itt began to crinkle and crowt;
    Shee said, 'Bowe downe, mantle,
      and shame me not for nought.

    29
    'Once I did amisse,
      I tell you certainlye,
    When I kist Craddockes mouth
      vnder a greene tree,
    When I kist Craddockes mouth
      before he marryed mee.'

    30
    When shee had her shreeuen,
      and her sines shee had tolde,
    The mantle stoode about her
      right as shee wold;

    31
    Seemelye of coulour,
      glittering like gold;
    Then euery k_nigh_t in Arthurs court
      did her behold.

    32
    Then spake dame Gueneuer
      to Arthur our king:
    'She hath tane yonder mantle,
      not with wright but w_i_th wronge!

    33
    'See you not yonder woman
      _tha_t maketh her selfe soe clene?
    I haue seene tane out of her bedd
      of men fiueteene;

    34
    'Preists, clarkes, and wedded men,
      from her by-deene;
    Yett shee taketh the mantle,
      and maketh her-selfe cleane!'

    35
    Then spake the litle boy
      _tha_t kept the mantle in hold;
    Sayes 'K_ing_, chasten thy wiffe;
      of her words shee is to bold.

    36
    'Shee is a bitch and a witch,
      and a whore bold;
    King, in thine owne hall
      thou art a cuchold.'

    37
    The litle boy stoode
      looking ou_e_r a dore;
    He was ware of a wyld bore,
      wold haue werryed a man.

    38
    He pulld forth a wood kniffe,
      fast thither _tha_t he ran;
    He brought in the bores head,
      and quitted him like a man.

    39
    He brought in the bores head,
      and was wonderous bold;
    He said there was neu_e_r a cucholds kniffe
      carue itt that cold.

    40
    Some rubbed their kniues
      vppon a whetstone;
    Some threw them vnder the table,
      and said they had none.

    41
    K_ing_ Arthur and the child
      stood looking them vpon;
    All their kniues edges
      turned backe againe.

    42
    Craddoccke had a litle kniue
      of iron and of steele;
    He birtled the bores head
      wonderous weele,
    _Tha_t euery k_nigh_t in the k_ing_s court
      had a morssell.

    43
    The litle boy had a horne,
      of red gold _tha_t ronge;
    He said, 'there was noe cuckolde
      shall drinke of my horne,
    But he shold itt sheede,
      either behind or beforne.'

    44
    Some shedd on their shoulder,
      and some on their knee;
    He _tha_t cold not hitt his mouth
      put it in his eye;
    And he _tha_t was a cuckold,
      euery man might him see.

    45
    Craddoccke wan the horne
      and the bores head;
    His ladye wan the mantle

[211] After I had finished what I had to say in the way of introduction
to this ballad, there appeared the study of the Trinkhorn and
Mantelsage, by Otto Warnatsch: Der Mantel, Bruchst[:u]ck eines
Lanzeletromans, etc., Breslau, 1883. To this very thorough piece of
work, in which the relations of the multiform versions of the
double-branched story are investigated with a care that had never before
been attempted, I naturally have frequent occasion to refer, and by its
help I have supplied some of my deficiencies, indicating always the
place by the author's name.

[212] The Biblioth[e']que des Romans, 1777, F['e]vrier, pp. 112-115,
gives an abstract of a small printed piece in prose, there assigned to
the beginning of the sixteenth century, which, as Warnatsch observes,
p. 72, must have been a different thing from the tale given by Legrand,
inasmuch as it brings in Lancelot and Gawain as suppressing the jests
of Kay and Dinadam.

[213] The custom of Arthur not to eat till he had heard of some
adventure or strange news was confined to those days when he held
full court, according to Perceval le Gallois, II, 217, 15,664-71, and
the Roman de Perceval, fol. lxxviii. It is mentioned, with the same
limitations, I suppose, in the Roman de Lancelot, III, fol. lxxxii,
and we learn from this last romance, I, fol. xxxvi, that Arthur was
accustomed to hold a court and wear his crown five times in the year,
at Easter, Ascension-day, Pentecost, All Saints, and Christmas. The
Roman de Merlin, II, lvi^b, or, as cited by Southey, II, 48, 49, says
that "King Arthur, after his first dinner at Logres, when he brought
home his bride, made a vow that while he wore a crown he never would
seat himself at table till some adventure had occurred." In Malory's
King Arthur, Kay reminds the king that this had been the old custom
of his court at Pentecost. Arthur is said to observe this custom on
Christmas, "vpon such a dere day," in Sir Gawayn and the Green Knight,
Madden, p. 6, vv 90-99. Messire Gauvain says "[a'] feste ne mangast,
devant," etc., p. 2, vv 18-21. Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival
does not limit the custom to high holidays, ed. Bartsch, I, 331, vv
875-79; and see Riddaras[:o]gur, Parcevals Saga, etc., ed. K[:o]lbing,
p. 26. Neither does Wigalois, vv 247-51, or a fragment of Daniel von
Bl[:u]henthal, Symbol[ae] ad literaturam Teutonicam, p. 465, cited by
Benecke, Wigalois, p. 436 f, or the F[:a]r[:o]e Galians kv[ae][dh]i,
K[:o]lbing, in Germania, XX, 397. See Madden's Syr Gawayne, which has
furnished much of this note, pp 310-12; Southey's King Arthur, II, 203,
462. Robin Hood imitates Arthur: see the beginning of the Little Gest.

    'Quar je vous aim tant bonement,
    Que je ne voudroie savoir
    Vostre mesfet por nul avoir.
    Miex en veuil je estre en doutance.

    Por tot le royaume de France,
    N'en voudroie je estre cert;
    Quar qui sa bone amie pert
    Molt a perdu, ce m'est avis.'      818-25.

[215] See also Brynj['u]lfsson, Saga af Tristram ok ['I]s[:o]nd, samt
M[:o]ttuls Saga, Udtog, pp 318-26, Copenhagen, 1878. There is a general
presumption that the larger part of the works translated for King
H['a]kon were derived from England. C. & W., p. 47.

[216] That is, the current one. The Samson saga professes to supply the
earlier history. Samson's father is another Arthur, king of England. An
abstract of so much of the saga as pertains to the Mantle is given by
Cederschi[:o]ld and Wulff, p. 90f. Warnatsch, p. 73 f, shows that the
R['i]mur and Samson had probably a common source, independent of the
M[:o]ttulssaga.

[217] By Warnatsch, who gives the text with the corresponding passages
of the fabliau in a parallel column, pp 8-54: the argument for
Heinrich's authorship, pp 85-105. 'Der Mantel' had been previously
printed in Haupt and Hoffmann's Altdeutsche Bl[:a]tter, II, 217, and by
M[:u]llenhoff in his Altdeutsche Sprachproben, p. 125. Of this poem, which
Warnatsch, pp 105-110, holds to be a fragment of a lost romance of
Lanzelet, written before the 'Cr[^o]ne,' only 994 verses are left.
Deducting about a hundred of introduction, there are some 782 German
against some 314 French verses, an excess which is owing, no doubt,
largely to insertions and expansions on the part of Heinrich, but in
some measure to the existing texts of the fabliau having suffered
abridgment. The whole matter of the church service, with the going and
coming, is dispatched in less than a dozen verses in the French, but
occupies more than seventy in German, and just here we read in the
French:

    Ci ne vueil je plus demorer,
    Ni de noient fere lone conte,
    Si con l'estoire le raconte.

But possibly the last verse should be taken with what follows.

[218] In Hahn, Griechische M[:a]rchen, No 70, II, 60 f, a walnut
contains a dress with the earth and its flowers displayed on it, an
almond one with the heaven and its stars, a hazel-nut one with the
sea and its fishes. No 7, I, 99, a walnut contains a complete costume
exhibiting heaven with its stars, a hazel-nut another with the sea
and its waves. No 67, II, 33, an almond encloses a woman's dress with
heaven and its stars on it, a hazel-nut a suit for her husband. In
the Grimms' No 113, three walnuts contain successively each a finer
dress than the other, II, 142 f, ed. 1857. There are three similar
nuts in Haltrich, No 43, and in Volksm[:a]rchen aus Venetien, Jahrbuch
f[:u]r r. u. e. Lit., VII, 249, No 12. Ulrich's mantle is worked with
all manner of beasts, birds, and sea monsters, on earth or under, and
betwixt earth and heaven: Lanzelet, 5820-27.

[219] I cite the text according to Warnatsch. Warnatsch thinks it worth
noticing that it is the queen only, in Mantel 771 f, as in our ballad,
st. 14, that curses the maker of the mantle; not, as in the fabliau, the
gentlemen whose feelings were so much tried. These, like the queen in
the ballad, ont maudit le mantel, et celui qui li aporta.

[220] Not even for Ginovere h[:u]bsch unde guot, or En[^i]te diu reine. The
queen has always been heedful of her acts, and has never done anything
wrong: doch ist siu an den gedenken missevarn, Heaven knows how. Ulrich
is very feeble here.

A remark is here in place which will be still more applicable to
some of the tests that are to be spoken of further on. Both the
French fabliau and the English ballad give to the mantle the power of
detecting the woman that has once done amiss, a de rien messerr['e]. We
naturally suppose that we understand what is meant. The trial in the
fabliau is so conducted as to confirm our original conception of the
nature of the inquest, and so it is, in the case of Arthur's queen,
Kay's lady, and the old knight's wife, in the ballad. But when we come
to the charmingly pretty passage about Cradock's wife, what are we to
think? Is the mantle in a teasing mood, or is it exhibiting its real
quality? If once to have kissed Cradock's mouth before marriage is
once to have done amiss, Heaven keep our Mirandas and our Perditas,
and Heaven forgive our Juliets and our Rosalinds! ("Les dames et
demoiselles, pour [^e]tre bais['e]es devant leur noces, il n'est pas
la coutume de France," we know, but this nice custom could hardly have
had sway in England. Is then this passage rendered from something in
French that is lost?) But the mantle, in the ballad, after indulging
its humor or its captiousness for a moment, does Cradock's wife full
justice. The mantle, if uncompromising as to acts, at least does not
assume to bring thoughts under its jurisdiction. Many of the probations
allow themselves this range, and as no definite idea is given of what
is charged, no one need be shocked, or perhaps disturbed, by the number
of convictions. The satire loses zest, and the moral effect is not
improved.

[221] Nul femme que [ne] vouloit lesser sauoir [a'] soun marry soun fet et
pens['e]. T. Wright, in Arch[ae]ologia Cambrensis, January, 1863, p. 10. Mr
Wright gives one of the texts of Cort Mantel, with an English
translation. We are further told, in Scalachronica, that this mantle was
afterwards made into a chasuble, and that it is "to this day" preserved
at Glastonbury. Three versions of the fabliau testify that Carados and
his _amie_ deposited the mantle in a Welsh abbey. The Skikkju R['i]mur say
that the lady presented it to the cloister of Cologne; the M[:o]ttulssaga
has simply a monastery (and, indeed, the mantle, as described by some,
must have had a vocation that way from the beginning). "Item, in the
castel of Douer ye may see Gauwayn's skull and Cradok's mantel:" Caxton,
in his preface to Kyng Arthur, 1485, I, ii, in Southey's ed.; cited by
Michel, Tristan, II, 181, and from him by Warnatsch.

[222] For this enchanter see _Le Livre de Karados_ in Perceval le
Gallois, ed. Potvin, II, 118 ff. It is not said in the printed copy that
he sent the mantle [horn].

[223] Another copy, assigned to the end of the 14th century, from the
Kolmar MS., Barisch, p. 373, No LXIX (Warnatsch).

[224] Warnatsch shows, p. 75 f, that the fastnachtspiel must have been
made up in part from some version of the Mantle story which was also the
source of the meisterlied, and in part from a meisterlied of the Horn,
which will be mentioned further on.

[225] The Dean of Lismore's Book, edited by Rev. Thomas M'Lauchlan, p.
72 of the translation, 50/51 of the original. Repeated in Campbell's
Heroic Gaelic Ballads, p. 138 f, 'The Maid of the White Mantle.' Mr
Campbell remarks: "This ballad, or the story of it, is known in Irish
writings. It is not remembered in Scotland now." Mr Wright cites this
poem, Arch[ae]ologia Cambrensis, p. 14 f, 39 f.

[226] Cf. Arthur in the Lai du Corn and Fraw Tristerat Horn, a little
further on.

[227] Wolf at first speaks of the lai as being made over into the
fabliau, in regular court style, ganz nach h[:o]fischer Weise, about the
middle of the 13th century; then goes on to say that even if the author
of the fabliau followed another version of the story, he must have known
the jongleur's poem, because he has repeated some of the introductory
lines of the lai. This excellent scholar happened, for once, not to
observe that the first fourteen lines of the lai, excepting the fourth,
which is questionable, are in a longer metre than the rest of the poem,
in eights and sevens, not sixes, and the first three of the lai, which
agree with the first three of the fabliau, in the eight-syllable verse
of the latter; so that it was not the author of the fabliau that
borrowed. Warnatsch (who has also made this last remark) has noted other
agreements between lai and fabliau, p. 61. Both of these acknowledge
their derivation from an earlier _dit, estoire_, not having which we
shall find it hard to determine by which and from what the borrowing was
done.

[228] Montpellier MS.

[229] Perceval exhibits agreements, both as to phrase and matter, now
with the lai, now with the fabliau, and this phenomenon will occur again
and again. This suggests the likelihood of a source which combined
traits of both lai and fabliau: Warnatsch, pp 62-64.

[230] So amended by Zingerle from Syrneyer lant. A third copy is cited
as in the Kolmar MS., No 806, Bartsch, Meisterlieder der Kolmarer
Handschrift, p. 74 (Warnatsch). A remarkable agreement between the
French lai, 94, 97, 99-102, and Wigamur 2623-30 convinces Warnatsch that
the source of this meisterlied must have been a Middle High German
rendering of some form of the Drinking-horn Test closely resembling the
lai. See Warnatsch, p. 66.

[231] The king of _Spain_, who is again the poorest of all the kings, p.
206, line 32, p. 214, line 22, is addressed by Arthur as his nephew, p.
207, line 11, and p. 193, line 30. Carados is called Arthur's nephew in
Perceval (he is son of Arthur's niece), e.g. 15,782, and Carados, his
father, is Carados de _Vaigne_, II, 117. It is said of Kalegras's _amie_
in the 'Mantle Rhymes,' III, 59, that many a lady looked down upon her.
This may be a chance expression, or possibly point to the poverty which
is attributed to the royal pair of Spain in Fastnachtspiele, Nos 81,
127, and in Frau Tristerat Horn. In Der Lanethen Mantel, Laneth is
Arthur's niece, and poor: see p. 261.

The fastnachtspiel has points in common with the fabliau, and the
assumption of a source which combined features of both lai and fabliau
is warrantable: Warnatsch, pp 66-68.

[232] This is a thoroughly dissolute piece, but not ambiguous. It is
also the most humorous of the whole series.

[233] Warnatsch shows that Heinrich cannot have derived any part of his
Trinkhornprobe from the Perceval of Chrestien, characteristic agreements
with Perceval being entirely wanting. There are agreements with the lai,
many more with the fabliau; and Heinrich's poem, so far as it is not of
his own invention, he believes to be compounded from his own version of
the fabliau and some lost version of the Horn-test: pp 111-114.

[234] The principal variations of this name, of which the Welsh Caradoc
is assumed to be the original, are: Craddocke (English ballad); Carados,
Caradox (Cort Mantel); Karodes (Scalachronica); Caraduz (Cr[^o]ne, 2309,
elsewhere) Karadas; Carigras, Kaligras (R['i]mur); Karodeus, Caraduel
(Perceval, 12,466, 12,457, 12,491, but generally), Carados, -ot, or;
Caraduel (Messire Gauvain, 3943); Garadue (Lai du Corn); Karadin
(M[:o]ttuls Saga). Garadue probably==Caraduel, which, in Percival twice,
and once in Messire Gauvain, is used for Carados, through confusion with
Arthur's residence, Carduel, Cardoil. So Karadas is twice put in the
Cr[^o]ne, 16,726, 16,743, for Karidol==Cardoil. Might not Karadin have been
written for Karadiu?

[235] Tristan of H['e]lie de Borron, I, 73 verso, in Rajna, Fonti dell'
Orlando Furioso, p. 498 ff. So in Malory's King Arthur, Southey, I, 297,
Wright, II, 64. The Italian Tristan, La Tavola Ritonda, ed. Polidori,
XLIII, pp 157-160, makes 686 try, of whom only 13 prove to be innocent,
and those in spite of themselves. Another account exempts 2 out of 365:
Nannucci, Manuale, II, 168-171.

[236] Un vasello fatto da ber, qual gi[a'], per fare accorto il suo
fratello del fallo di Ginevra, fe Morgana: XLIII, 28; un bel nappo d'or,
di fuor di gamme, XLII, 98. The Orlando concurs with the prose Tristan
as to the malice of Morgan, but does not, with the Tristan, depart from
prescription in making the women drink. Warnatsch observes that the
Orlando agrees with the Horn Fastnachtspiel, and may with it follow some

[238] See the story in Le Livre de Carados, Perceval le Gallois, Potvin,
especially II, 214-16, vv 15,577-638. "The Rev. Evan Evans," says Percy,
Reliques, III, 349, ed. 1794, "affirmed that the story of the Boy and
the Mantle is taken from what is related in some of the old Welsh MSS of
Tegan Earfron, _one of King Arthur's mistresses_." This aspersion, which
is even absurd, must have arisen from a misunderstanding on the part of
the Bishop: no Welshman could so err.

[239] Myvyrian Arch[ae]ology, III, 247^a, No 10, pointed out to me by
Professor Evans. The story of the 'Boy and the Mantle,' says Warton, "is
recorded in many manuscript Welsh chronicles, as I learn from original
letters of Llwyd, in the Ashmolean Museum:" History of English Poetry,
ed. 1871, I, 97, note 1.

[240] The horn is No 4 in Jones's list, and No 3 in a manuscript of
Justice Bosanquet; the knife is 13th in Jones and 6th in the other; the
mantle of invisibility is 13th in the Bosanquet series, and, under the
title of Arthur's veil or mask, 1st in Jones. The mantle of Tegau
Eurvron does not occur in the Bosanquet MS. Jones says, "The original
Welsh account of the above regalia was transcribed from a transcript of
Mr Edward Llwyd, the antiquary, who informs me that he copied it from an
old parchment MS. I have collated this with two other MSS." Not a word
of dates. Jones's Welsh Bards, II, 47-49; Lady Charlotte Guest's
Mabinogion, II, 353-55.

Lady Charlotte Guest remarks that a boar's head in some form appears as
the armorial bearing of all of Caradawc's name. Though most anxious to
believe all that is said of Caradawc, I am compelled to doubt whether
this goes far to prove that he owned the knife celebrated in the ballad.

In the first two probations a false heart is the corpus delicti;

The scope of the glove is of the widest. It takes cognizance of _rede

unzuht und zageheit_, in men. One must have known as little what one was
convicted of as if one had been in the hands of the Holy Office.

[245] A man must be "clear as beryl." One of the knights is tumbled into
the water for having kissed a lady; but this is according to the code,

permissible; marry, not without the lady be willing. 'Die bruck zu
Karidol' is alluded to in 'Der Spiegel,' Meister Alswert, ed. Holland u.

contrary doth prove cannot keep it on. But what could one expect from a
cast-off girdle of Venus?

The mutilation of the earlier pages of the Percy manuscript leaves us in
possession of only one half of this ballad, and that half in eight
fragments, so that even the outline of the story cannot be fully made
out.[259] We have, to be sure, the whole of a French poem which must be
regarded as the probable source of the ballad, and, in view of the
recklessness of the destroyer Time, may take comfort; for there are few
things in this kind that the Middle Ages have bequeathed which we could
not better spare. But the losses from the English ballad are still very
regrettable, since from what is in our hands we can see that the story
was treated in an original way, and so much so that comparison does not
stead us materially.

'King Arthur and King Cornwall' is apparently an imitation, or a
traditional variation, of Charlemagne's Journey to Jerusalem and
Constantinople, a _chanson de geste_ of complete individuality and of
remarkable interest. This all but incomparable relic exists in only a
single manuscript,[260] and that ill written and not older than the end
of the thirteenth century, while the poem itself may be assigned to the
beginning of the twelfth, if not to the latter part of the
eleventh.[261] Subsequently, the story, with modifications, was
introduced into the romance of Galien, and in this setting it occurs in
three forms, two manuscript of the fifteenth century, and the third a
printed edition of the date 1500. These are all in prose, but betray by
metrical remains imbedded in them their descent from a romance in verse,
which there are reasons for putting at least as early as the beginning
of the fourteenth century.[262]

A very little of the story, and this little much changed, is found in
Italian romances of Charles's Journey to Spain and of Ogier the Dane.
The derivation from Galien is patent.[263]

The Journey of Charlemagne achieved great popularity, as it needs must.
It forms a section of the Karlamagnus Saga, a prose translation into
Norse of _gestes_ of Charles and his peers, made in the thirteenth
century, and probably for King H['a]kon the Old, though this is
not expressly said, as in the case of the 'Mantle.' Through the
Norwegian version the story of Charles's journey passed into the other
Scandinavian dialects. There is a Swedish version, slightly defective,
existing in a manuscript earlier than 1450, and known to be older than
the manuscript, and a Danish abridgment, thought to have been made from
the Swedish version, is preserved in a manuscript dated 1480, which
again is probably derived from an elder. Like the 'Mantle,' the Journey
of Charlemagne is treated in Icelandic R['i]mur, the oldest manuscript
being put at about 1500. These Rhymes (Geiplur, Gabs, Japes), though
their basis is the Norwegian saga, present variations from the existing
manuscripts of this saga. There is also a F[:a]r[:o]e traditional
ballad upon this theme, 'Geipa-t['a]ttur.' This ballad has much that is
peculiar to itself.[264]

Charlemagne's Journey was also turned into Welsh in the thirteenth
century. Three versions are known, of which the best is in the Red Book
of Hergest.[265]

Let us now see what is narrated in the French poem.

One day when Charlemagne was at St Denis he had put on his crown and
sword, and his wife had on a most beautiful crown, too. Charles took her
by the hand, under an olive-tree, and asked her if she had ever seen a
king to whom crown and sword were so becoming. The empress was so unwise
as to reply that possibly he thought too well of himself: she knew of a
king who appeared to even better advantage when he wore his crown.
Charles angrily demanded where this king was to be found: they would
wear their crowns together, and if the French sided with her, well; but
if she had not spoken truth, he would cut off her head. The empress
endeavored to explain away what she had said: the other king was simply
richer, but not so good a knight, etc. Charles bade her name him, on her
head. There being no escape, the empress said she had heard much of
Hugo, the emperor of Greece and Constantinople. "By my faith," said
Charles, "you have made me angry and lost my love, and are in a fair way
to lose your head, too. I will never rest till I have seen this king."

The emperor, having made his offering at St Denis, returned to Paris,
taking with him his twelve peers and some thousand of knights. To these
he announced that they were to accompany him to Jerusalem, to adore the
cross and the sepulchre, and that he would incidentally look up a king
that he had heard of. They were to take with them seven hundred camels,
laden with gold and silver, and be prepared for an absence of seven
years.

Charlemagne gave his people a handsome equipment, but not of arms. They
left behind them their lances and swords, and took the pilgrim's staff
and scrip. When they came to a great plain it appeared that the number
was not less than eighty thousand: but we do not have to drag this host
through the story, which concerns itself only with Charles and his
peers. They arrived at Jerusalem one fine day, selected their inns, and
went to the minster. Here Jesus and his apostles had sung mass, and the
chairs which they had occupied were still there. Charles seated himself
in the middle one, his peers on either side. A Jew came in, and, seeing
Charles, fell to trembling; so fierce was the countenance of the emperor
that he dared not look at it, but fled from the church to the patriarch,
and begged to be baptized, for God himself and the twelve apostles were
come. The patriarch went to the church, in procession, with his clergy.
Charles rose and made a profound salutation, the priest and the monarch
embraced, and the patriarch inquired who it was that had assumed to
enter that church as he had done. "Charles is my name," was the answer.
"Twelve kings have I conquered, and I am seeking a thirteenth whom I
have heard of. I have come to Jerusalem to adore the cross and the
sepulchre." The patriarch proving gracious, Charles went on to ask for
relics to take home with him. "A plentet en avrez," says the patriarch;
"St Simeon's arm, St Lazarus's head, St Stephen's--" "Thanks!" "The
sudarium, one of the nails, the crown of thorns, the cup, the dish, the
knife, some of St Peter's beard, some hairs from his head--" "Thanks!"
"Some of Mary's milk, of the holy shift--" And all these Charles
received.[266] He stayed four months in Jerusalem, and began the church
of St Mary. He presented the patriarch with a hundred mule-loads of gold
and silver, and asked "his leave and pardon" to return to France: but
first he would find out the king whom his wife had praised. They take
the way through Jericho to gather palms. The relics are so strong that
every stream they come to divides before them, every blind man receives
sight, the crooked are made straight, and the dumb speak.[267] On
reaching Constantinople they have ample reason to be impressed with the
magnificence of the place. Passing twenty thousand knights, who are
playing at chess and tables, dressed in pall and ermine, with fur cloaks
training at their feet, and three thousand damsels in equally sumptuous
attire, who are disporting with their lovers, they come to the king, who
is at that moment taking his day at the plough, not on foot, goad in
hand, but seated most splendidly in a chair drawn by mules, and holding
a gold wand, the plough all gold, too; none of this elegance, however,
impairing the straightness of his majesty's furrow. The kings exchange
greetings. Charles tells Hugo that he is last from Jerusalem, and should
be glad to see him and his knights. Hugo makes him free to stay a year,
if he likes, unyokes the oxen, and conducts his guests to the palace.

The palace is gorgeous in the extreme, and, omitting other architectural
details, it is circular, and so constructed as to turn like a wheel when
the wind strikes it from the west. Charles thinks his own wealth not
worth a glove in comparison, and remembers how he had threatened his
wife. "Lordings," he says, "many a palace have I seen, but none like
this had even Alexander, Constantine, or C[ae]sar." At that moment a strong
wind arose which set the palace in lively motion; the emperor was fain
to sit down on the floor; the twelve peers were all upset, and as they
lay on their backs, with faces covered, said one to the other, "This is
a bad business: the doors are open, and yet we can't get out!" But as
evening approached the wind subsided; the Franks recovered their legs,
and went to supper. At the table they saw the queen and the princess, a
beautiful blonde, of whom Oliver became at once enamored. After a most
royal repast, the king conducted Charles and the twelve to a
bed-chamber, in which there were thirteen beds. It is doubtful whether
modern luxury can vie with the appointments in any respect, and certain
that we are hopelessly behind in one, for this room was lighted by a
carbuncle. But, again, there was one luxury which Hugo did not allow
them, and this was privacy, even so much privacy as thirteen can have.
He had put a man in a hollow place under a marble stair, to watch them
through a little hole.

The Franks, as it appears later, had drunk heavily at supper, and this
must be their excuse for giving themselves over, when in a foreign
country, to a usage or propensity which they had no doubt indulged in at
home, and which is familiar in northern poetry and saga, that of making
brags (gabs, Anglo-Saxon be['o]t, gilp[268]). Charles began: Let Hugo arm
his best man in two hauberks and two helms, and set him on a charger:
then, if he will lend me his sword, I will with a blow cut through
helms, hauberks, and saddle, and if I let it have its course, the blade
shall never be recovered but by digging a spear's depth in the ground.
"Perdy," says the man in hiding, "what a fool King Hugo was when he gave
you lodging!"

Roland followed: Tell Hugo to lend me his horn, and I will go into yon
plain and blow such a blast that not a gate or a door in all the city
shall be left standing, and a good man Hugo will be, if he faces me, not
to have his beard burned from his face and his fur robe carried away.
Again said the man under the stair, "What a fool was King Hugo!"

The emperor next called upon Oliver, whose gab was:

    'Prenget li reis sa fille qui tant at bloi le peil,
    En sa chambre nos metet en un lit en requeit;
    Se jo n'ai testimoigne de li anuit cent feiz,
    Demain perde la teste, par covent li otrei.'

"You will stop before that," said the spy; "great shame have you
spoken."

Archbishop Turpin's brag was next in order: it would have been more in
keeping for Turpin of Hounslow Heath, and we have all seen it performed
in the travelling circus. While three of the king's best horses are
running at full speed on the plain, he will overtake and mount the
foremost, passing the others, and will keep four big apples in constant
motion from one hand to the other; if he lets one fall, put out his
eyes.[269] "A good brag this," is the comment of the simple scout
(_l'escolte_), "and no shame to my lord."

William of Orange will take in one hand a metal ball which thirty men
have never been able to stir, and will hurl it at the palace wall and
bring down more than forty toises of it. "The king is a knave if he does
not make you try," says _l'escolte_.

The other eight gabs may be passed over, save one. Bernard de Brusban
says, "You see that roaring stream? To-morrow I will make it leave its
bed, cover the fields, fill the cellars of the city, drench the people,
and drive King Hugo into his highest tower, from which he shall never
come down without my leave." "The man is mad," says the spy. "What a
fool King Hugo was! As soon as morning dawns they shall all pack."

The spy carries his report to his master without a moment's delay. Hugo
swears that if the brags are not accomplished as made, his guests shall
lose their heads, and orders out a hundred thousand men-at-arms to
enforce his resolution.

When the devout emperor of the west came from mass the next morning
(Hugo was evidently not in a state of mind to go), he advanced to meet
his brother of Constantinople, olive branch in hand; but Hugo called out
from far off, "Charles, why did you make me the butt of your brags and
your scorns?" and repeated that all must be done, or thirteen heads
would fall. Charles replied that they had drunk a good deal of wine the
night before, and that it was the custom for the French when they had
gone to bed to allow themselves in jesting. He desired to speak with his
knights. When they were together, the emperor said that they had drunk
too much, and had uttered what they ought not. He caused the relics to
be brought, and they all fell to praying and beating their breasts, that
they might be saved from Hugo's wrath, when lo, an angel appeared, who
bade them not be afraid; they had committed a great folly yesterday, and
must never brag again, but for this time, "Go, begin, not one of them
shall fail."[270]

Charles returned to Hugo master of the situation. He repeated that they
had drunk too much wine the night before, and went on to say that it was
an outrage on Hugo's part to set a spy in the room, and that they knew a
land where such an act would be accounted villainy: "but all shall be
carried out; choose who shall begin." Hugo said, Oliver; and let him not
fall short of his boast, or I will cut off his head, and the other
twelve shall share his fate. The next morning, in pursuance of an
arrangement made between Oliver and the princess, the king was informed
that what had been undertaken had been precisely discharged. "The first
has saved himself," says Hugo; "by magic, I believe; now I wish to know
about the rest." "What next?" says Charlemagne. William of Orange was
called for, threw off his furs, lifted the huge ball with one hand,
hurled it at the wall, and threw down more than forty toises. "They are
enchanters," said the king to his men. "Now I should like to see if the
rest will do as much. If one of them fails, I will hang them all
to-morrow." "Do you want any more of the gabs?" asked Charles. Hugo
called upon Bernard to do what he had threatened. Bernard asked the
prayers of the emperor, ran down to the water, and made the sign of the
cross. All the water left its bed, spread over the fields, came into the
city, filled the cellars, drenched the people, and drove King Hugo into
his highest tower; Charles and the peers being the while ensconced in an
old pine-tree, all praying for God's pity.

Charles in the tree heard Hugo in the tower making his moan: he would
give the emperor all his treasure, would become his man and hold his
kingdom of him. The emperor was moved, and prayed that the flood might
stop, and at once the water began to ebb. Hugo was able to descend from
his tower, and he came to Charles, under an "ympe tree," and repeated
what he had uttered in the moment of extremity. "Do you want the rest of
the gabs?" asked Charles. "Ne de ceste semaine," replied Hugo. "Then,
since you are my man," said the emperor, "we will make a holiday and
wear our crowns together." When the French saw the two monarchs walking
together, and Charles overtopping Hugo by fifteen inches, they said the
queen was a fool to compare anybody with him.

After this promenade there was mass, at which Turpin officiated, and
then a grand dinner. Hugo once more proffered all his treasures to
Charles, but Charles would not take a denier. "We must be going," he
said. The French mounted their mules, and went off in high spirits. Very
happy was Charles to have conquered such a king without a battle.
Charles went directly to St Denis, and performed his devotions. The nail
and the crown he deposited on the altar, distributed the other relics
over the kingdom, and for the love of the sepulchre he gave up his anger
against the queen.

The story in the English ballad, so far as it is to be collected from
our eight fragments, is that Arthur, represented as King of Little
Britain, while boasting to Gawain of his round table, is told by
Guenever that she knows of one immeasurably finer; the very trestle is
worth his halls and his gold, and the palace it stands in is worth all
Little Britain besides; but not a word will she say as to where this
table and this goodly building may be. Arthur makes a vow never to sleep
two nights in one place till he sees that round table; and, taking for
companions Gawain, Tristram, Sir Bredbeddle, and an otherwise unknown
Sir Marramiles, sets out on the quest.

The pilgrimage which, to save his dignity, Charles makes a cover for his
visit to the rival king forms no part of Arthur's programme.[271] The
five assume a palmer's weed simply for disguise, and travel east and
west, in many a strange country, only to arrive at Cornwall, so very
little a way from home.

The proud porter of Cornwall's gate, a minion swain, befittingly clad in
a suit of gold, for his master is the richest king in Christendom, or
yet in heathenness, is evidently impressed with Arthur's bearing, as is
quite the rule in such cases:[272] he has been porter thirty years and
three, but [has never seen the like]. Cornwall would naturally ask the
pilgrims some questions. From their mentioning some shrine of Our Lady
he infers that they have been in Britain,--Little Britain we must
suppose to be meant. Cornwall asks if they ever knew King Arthur, and
boasts that he had lived seven years in Little Britain, and had had a
daughter by Arthur's wife, now a lady of radiant beauty, and Arthur has
none such.[273] He then sends for his steed, which he can ride three
times as far in a day as Arthur can any of his, and we may suppose that
he also exhibits to his guests a horn and a sword of remarkable
properties, and a Bur-low-Beanie, or Billy-Blin, a seven-headed,
fire-breathing fiend whom he has in his service. Arthur is then
conducted to bed, and the Billy-Blin, shut up, as far as we can make
out, in some sort of barrel, or other vessel,[274] is set by Arthur's
bed-side to hear and report the talk of the pilgrims. Now, it would
seem, the knights make each their vow or brag. Arthur's is that he will
be the death of Cornwall King before he sees Little Britain. Gawain, who
represents Oliver, will have Cornwall's daughter home with him. Here
there is an unlucky gap. Tristram should undertake to carry off the
horn, Marramiles the steed, and Sir Bredbeddle the sword. But first it
would be necessary to subdue the loathly fiend. Bredbeddle goes to work
without dallying, bursts open the rub-chadler with his sword, and fights
the fire-breathing monster in a style that is a joy to see; but sword,
knife, and axe all break, and he is left without a weapon. Yet he had
something better to fall back on, and that was a little book which he
had found by the seaside, no doubt in the course of those long travels
which conducted the pilgrims from Little Britain to Cornwall. It was
probably a book of Evangiles; our Lord had written it with his hands and
sealed it with his blood. With this little book, which in a manner takes
the place of the relics in the French tale, for the safety of the
pilgrims and the accomplishment of their vows are secured through it,
Bredbeddle conjures the Burlow-beanie, and shuts him up till wanted in a
"wall of stone," which reminds us of the place in which Hugo's spy is
concealed. He then reports to Arthur, who has a great desire to see the
fiend in all his terrors, and, upon the king's promising to stand firm,
Bredbeddle makes the fiend start out again, with his seven heads and the
fire flying out of his mouth. The Billy-Blin is now entirely amenable to
command: Bredbeddle has only to "conjure" him to do a thing, and it is
done. First he fetches down the steed. Marramiles, who perhaps had vowed
to bring off the horse, considers that he is the man to ride him, but
finds he can do nothing with him, and has to call on Bredbeddle for
help. The Billy-Blin is required to tell how the steed is to be ridden,
and reveals that three strokes of a gold wand which stands in Cornwall's
study-window will make him spring like spark from brand. And so it comes
out that Cornwall is a magician. Next the horn has to be fetched, but,
when brought, it cannot be sounded. For this a certain powder is
required. This the fiend procures, and Tristram blows a blast which
rends the horn up to the midst.[275] Finally the Billy-Blin is conjured
to fetch the sword, and with this sword Arthur goes and strikes off
Cornwall's head. So Arthur keeps his vow, and, so far as we can see, all
the rest are in a condition to keep theirs.

The English ballad retains too little of the French story to enable us
to say what form of it this little was derived from. The poem of Galien
would cover all that is borrowed as well as the Journey of Charlemagne.
It may be regarded as an indication of late origin that in this ballad
Arthur is king of _Little_ Britain, that Bredbeddle and Marramiles are
made the fellows of Gawain and Tristram, Bredbeddle carrying off all the
honors, and that Cornwall has had an intrigue with Arthur's queen. The
name Bredbeddle is found elsewhere only in the late Percy version of the
romance of the Green Knight, Hales and Furnivall, II, 56, which version
alludes to a custom of the Knights of the Bath, an order said to have
been instituted by Henry IV at his coronation, in 1399.

The F[:a]r[:o]e ballad, 'Geipa-t['a]ttur,' exists in four versions:
#A#, Svabo's manuscript collection, 1782, III, 1, 85 stanzas; #B#,
Sand[/o]bog, 1822, p. 49, 140 stanzas; #C#, Fugl[/o]bog, c. 1840, p.
9, 120 stanzas; #D#, Syder[/o] version, obtained by Hammershaimb,
1848, 103 stanzas.[276] It repeats the story of the Norse saga, with
a moderate number of traditional accretions and changes. The emperor,
from his throne, asks his champions where is his superior [equal].
They all drop their heads; no one ventures to answer but the queen,
who better had been silent. "The emperor of Constantinople" (H['a]kin,
#D#), she says, "is thy superior." "If he is not," answers Karl,
"thou shalt burn on bale." In #B#, when they have already started for
Constantinople, Turpin persuades them to go rather to Jerusalem: in
the other versions it must be assumed that the holy city was on the
route. As Karl enters the church the bells ring and the candles light
of themselves, #C#, #D#. There are thirteen seats in the choir: Karl
takes the one that Jesus had occupied, and the peers those of the
apostles. A heathen tells the patriarch[277] that the Lord is come
down from heaven, #C#, #D#. The patriarch proceeds to the church, with
no attendance but his altar-book [singing from his altar-book]; he
asks Karl what he has come for, and Karl replies, to see the halidoms,
#A#, #C#, #D#. In #B# the patriarch presents himself to the emperor
at his lodging, and inquires his purpose; and, learning that he is
on his way to Constantinople, for glory, advises him first to go to
the church, where the ways and means of success are to be found. The
patriarch gives Karl some of the relics: the napkin on which Jesus had
wiped his hands, cups from which he had drunk, etc. Karl, in #A#, #C#,
now announces that he is on his way to Constantinople; the patriarch
begs him not to go, for he will have much to suffer. At the exterior
gate of the palace will be twelve white bears, ready to go at him; the
sight of his sword [of the holy napkin, #B#] will cause them to fall
stone-dead, or at least harmless, #B#. At the gate next within there
will be twelve wolf-dogs[278] [and further on twelve toads, #B#], which
must be disposed of in like wise: etc. The castle stands on a hundred
pillars, #A#, and is full of ingenious contrivances: the floor goes up
to the sky, and the roof comes down to the ground, #B#. Karl now sets
out, with the patriarch's blessing and escort. Before they reach the
palace they come upon three hundred knights and ladies dancing, which
also had been foretold, and at the portals of the palace they find and
vanquish the formidable beasts. The palace is to the full as splendid
and as artfully constructed as they had been informed: the floor goes
up and the roof comes down, #B#; there are monstrous figures (?), with
horns at their mouths, and upon a wind rising the horns all sound, the
building begins to revolve, and the Frenchmen jump up, each clinging to
the other, #B#, #C#, #D#. Karl remembers what his wife had said, #A#,
#D#.

Of the reception by the monarch of Constantinople nothing further is
said. We are immediately taken to the bedroom, in which there are twelve
beds, with a thirteenth in the middle, and also a stone arch, or vault,
inside of which is a man with a candle. Karl proposes that they shall
choose feats, make boasts, rouses [_skemtar_, jests, #C#]. These would
inevitably be more or less deranged and corrupted in the course of
tradition. #A# and #C# have lost many. Karl's boast, dropped in #B#,
#C#, is that he will smite King H['a]kin, so that the sword's point shall
stick in the ground, #D#; hit the emperor on the neck and knock him off
his horse, #A#. Roland, in all, will blow the emperor's hair off his
head with the blast of his horn. Oliver's remains as in the French poem.
William of Orange's ball is changed to a bolt. The exploit with the
horses and apples is assigned to Bernard in #D#, the only version which
preserves it, as in the Norse saga; and, as in the saga again, it is
Turpin, and not Bernard, who brings in the river upon the town, and
forces the king to take refuge in the tower.

Early in the morning the spy reports in writing, and King H['a]kin, #D#,
says that Karl and his twelve peers shall burn on the bale, #A#, #C#,
#D#, if they cannot make good their boasts, #B#. Karl's queen appears to
him in his sleep, #A#, and bids him think of last night's words. It is
the queen of Constantinople in #B#, #C#, #D# who rouses Karl to a sense
of his plight; in #B# she tells him that the brags have been reported,
and that burning will be the penalty unless they be achieved. Karl then
sees that his wife knew what she was saying, and vows to give her
Hildarheim and a scarlet cloak if he gets home alive. He hastens to
church; a dove descends from heaven and sits on his arm [in #B# a voice
comes from heaven]; he is assured that the boasts shall all be
performed, but never let such a thing be done again. In #A# three of the
feats are executed, in #D# four, in #C# seven, Oliver's in each case
strictly, and Turpin's, naturally, last. The king in #C# does the feat
which is proposed by Eimer in the saga. #A# and #C# end abruptly with
Turpin's exploit. In #D# Karl falls on his knees and prays, and the
water retires; Karl rides out of Constantinople, followed three days on
the road by Koronatus, as H['a]kin is now called, stanza 103: it is
Karlamagn['u]s that wears his crown higher. #B# takes a turn of its own.
Roland, Olger and Oliver are called upon to do their brags. Roland blows
so that nobody in Constantinople can keep his legs, and the emperor
falls into the mud, but he blows not a hair off the emperor's head;
Olger slings the gold-bolt over the wall, but breaks off none; Oliver
gives a hundred kisses, as in the saga. The emperor remarks each time, I
hold him no champion that performs his rouse that way. But Turpin's brag
is thoroughly done; the emperor is driven to the tower, and begs Karl to
turn off the water; no more feats shall be exacted. Now the two kaisers
walk in the hall, conferring about tribute, which Karl takes and rides
away. When he reaches home his queen welcomes him, and asks what
happened at Constantinople: "Hvat gekk af?" "This," says Karl; "I know
the truth now; you shall be queen as before, and shall have a voice in
the rule."

It is manifest that Charlemagne's pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the visit
to the king of Constantinople, though somewhat intimately combined in
the old French _geste_, were originally distinct narratives. As far as
we can judge, nothing of the pilgrimage was retained by the English
ballad. We are not certain, even, that it is Charlemagne's visit to Hugo
upon which the ballad was formed, though the great popularity of the
French poem makes this altogether likely. As M. Gaston Paris has said
and shown,[279] the visit to Hugo is one of a cycle of tales of which
the framework is this: that a king who regards himself as the richest or
most magnificent in the world is told that there is somebody that
outstrips him, and undertakes a visit to his rival to determine which
surpasses the other, threatening death to the person who has disturbed
his self-complacency, in case the rival should turn out to be his
inferior. A familiar example is afforded by the tale of Aboulcassem, the
first of the Mille et un Jours. Haroun Alraschid was incessantly
boasting that no prince in the world was so generous as he.[280] The
vizier Giafar humbly exhorted the caliph not to praise himself, but to
leave that to others. The caliph, much piqued, demanded, Do you then
know anybody who compares with me? Giafar felt compelled to reply that
there was a young man at Basra, who, though in a private station, was
not inferior even to the caliph in point of generosity. Haroun was very
angry, and, on Giafar's persisting in what he had said, had the vizier
arrested, and finally resolved to go to Basra to see with his own eyes:
if Giafar should have spoken the truth, he should be rewarded, but in
the other event he should forfeit his life.[281]

This story, it is true, shows no trace of the gabs which Charlemagne
and the peers make, and which Hugo requires to be accomplished on pain
of death. The gabs are a well-known North-European custom, and need
not be sought for further; but the requiring by one king of certain
feats to be executed by another under a heavy penalty is a feature of a
large class of Eastern tales of which there has already been occasion
to speak: see 'The Elfin Knight,' p. 11. The demand in these, however,
is made not in person, but through an ambassador. The combination of
a personal visit with a task to be performed under penalty of death
is seen in the Vaf[th]r['u][dh]nism['a]l, where Odin, disguised as
a traveller, seeks a contest in knowledge with the wisest of the
giants.[282]

The story of the gabs has been retold in two modern imitations: very
indifferently by Nivelle de la Chauss['e]e, 'Le Roi Hugon,' [OE]uvres, t.
V, suppl['e]ment, p. 66, ed. 1778, and well by M. J. Ch['e]nier, 'Les
Miracles,' III, 259, ed. 1824.[283] Uhland treated the subject
dramatically in a composition which has not been published: Keller,
Altfranz[:o]sische Sagen, 1876, Inhalt (Koschwitz).

    Then bespake Lady Qu_een_ Gueneuer,
      And these were the words said shee:

    Then they tranckled a litle further,

      And all his other rayment was vnto the same:

      'Yonder is a minion swaine.'

    Then bespake noble K_ing_ Arthur,

    'Come hither, thou proud porter,
      I pray thee come hither to me.

    14
    'I haue two poore rings of my finger,
      The better of them Ile giue to thee;
    Tell who may be lord of this castle,' he sayes,
      'Or who is lord in this cuntry?'

    15
    'Cornewall K_ing_,' the porter sayes,
      'There is none soe rich as hee;
    Neither in christendome, nor yet in heathen-nest,
      None hath soe much gold as he.'

    16
    And then bespake him noble K_ing_ Arthur,
      These were the words sayes hee:
    'I haue two poore rings of my finger,

    'Pray him for one nights lodging and two meales meate,

      And these were the words said he:
    'What weapons wilt thou haue, thou gentle knight?
      I pray thee tell to me.'

    42
    He sayes, 'Collen brand Ile haue in my hand,
      And a Millaine knife fast by me knee,
    And a Danish axe fast in my hands,
      _Tha_t a sure weapon I thinke wilbe.'

    Then with his Collen brand _tha_t he had in his hand
      The bunge of that rub-chandler he burst in three;

      But ly still in that wall of stone,
    Till I haue beene with noble K_ing_ Arthur,
      And told him what I haue done.'

    49
    And when he came to the k_ing_s chamber,
      He cold of his curtesie:
    Says, 'Sleepe you, wake you, noble K_ing_ Arthur?
      And euer Iesus waken yee!'

    50
    'Nay, I am not sleeping, I am waking,'
      These were the words said hee;
    'Ffor thee I haue card; how hast thou fared?
      O gentle knight, let me see.'

    51
    The knight wrought the k_ing_ his booke,
      Bad him behold, reede and see;
    And euer he found it on the backside of the leafe
      As noble Arthur wold wish it to be.

    52
    And then bespake him K_ing_ Arthur,
      'Alas! thow gentle knight, how may this be,
    That I might see him in the same licknesse
      _Tha_t he stood vnto thee?'

    53
    And then bespake him the Greene Knight,
      These were the words said hee:
    'If youle stand stifly in the battell stronge,
      For I haue won all the victory.'

    54
    Then bespake him the k_ing_ againe,
      And these were the words said hee:
    'If wee stand not stifly in this battell strong,
      Wee are worthy to be hanged all on a tree.'

    55
    Then bespake him the Greene Knight,
      These were the words said he:
    Saies, 'I doe coniure thee, thou fowle feend,

    Saith, 'I coniure thee, thou fowle feend,
      _Tha_t thou feitch downe the steed that we see.'

    60
    And then forth is gone Burlow-beanie,
      As fast as he cold hie,
    And feitch he did _tha_t faire steed,
      And came againe by and by.

    61
    Then bespake him S_ir_ Marramiles,
      And these were the words said hee:
    'Riding of this steed, brother Bredbeddle,
      The mastery belongs to me.'

    62
    Marramiles tooke the steed to his hand,
      To ryd him he was full bold;
    He cold noe more make him goe
      Then a child of three yeere old.

    63
    He laid vppon him w_i_th heele and hand,
      W_i_th yard that was soe fell;
    'Helpe! brother Bredbeddle,' says Marramile,
      'For I thinke he be the devill of hell.

    64
    'Helpe! brother Bredbeddle,' says Marramile,
      'Helpe! for Christs pittye;
    Ffor w_i_thout thy help, brother Bredbeddle,
      He will neuer be rydden for me.'

    65
    Then bespake him S_ir_ Bredbeddle,
      These were the words said he:
    'I coniure thee, thou Burlow-beane,
      Thou tell me how this steed was riddin in his country.'

    66
    He saith, 'there is a gold wand

    Says, 'I coniure thee, thou Burlow-beanie,
      The powder-box thou feitch me.'

    71
    Then forth is gone Burlow-beanie,
      As fast as he cold hie,
    And feich he did the powder-box,
      And came againe by and by.

    72
    Then S_ir_ Tristeram tooke powder forth of _tha_t box,
      And blent it w_i_th warme sweet milke,
    And there put it vnto that horne,
      And swilled it about in that ilke.

    73
    Then he tooke the horne in his hand,
      And a lowd blast he blew;
    He rent the horne vp to the midst,
      All his ffellowes this th['e] knew.

    74
    Then bespake him the Greene Knight,
      These were the words said he:

    Then forth is gone Burlow-beanie,

    And feitch he did that faire sword,
      And came againe by and by.

    76
    Then bespake him Sir Bredbeddle,
      To the k_ing_ these words said he:

[259] Half a page is gone in the manuscript between 'Robin Hood's Death'
and the beginning of this ballad, and again between the end of this
ballad and the beginning of 'Sir Lionel.' 'Robin Hood's Death,' judging
by another copy, is complete within two or three stanzas, and 'Sir
Lionel' appears to lack nothing. We may suppose that quite half a dozen
stanzas are lost from both the beginning and the end of 'King Arthur and
King Cornwall.'

the Pilgrimage was made over (renouvel['e]) at the end of the twelfth or
the beginning of the thirteenth century, and this _rifacimento_
intercalated in Galien by some rhymer of the fourteenth. See his
'Galien,' in Hist. Litt. de la France, XXVIII, 221-239, for all that
concerns the subject.

Danish Chronicle of Charlemagne is printed in Brandt's Romantisk
Digtning fra Middelalderen, Copenhagen, 1877, the Journey to the Holy
Land, p. 146 ff. Brandt does not admit that the Danish chronicle
was translated from Swedish: p. 347. The 'Geiplur,' 968 vv, and one
version of 'Geipa-t['a]ttur,' 340 vv, are included in Koschwitz's Sechs
Bearbeitungen, p. 139 ff, p. 174 ff. For a discussion of them see
K[:o]lbing in Germania, XX, 233-239, and as to the relations of the
several versions, etc., Koschwitz, in Romanische Studien, II, 1 ff,
his Ueberlieferung und Sprache der Chanson du Voyage de Charlemagne,
and Sechs Bearbeitungen, Einleitung. The F[:a]r[:o]e ballad is thought
to show traces in some places of Christiern Pedersen's edition of the
Danish chronicle, 1584 (K[:o]lbing, as above, 238, 239), or of stall
prints founded on that. This does not, however, necessarily put the
ballad into the sixteenth century. Might not Pedersen have had ballad
authority for such changes and additions as he made? It may well be
supposed that he had, and if what is peculiar to Pedersen may have come
from ballads, we must hesitate to derive the ballads from Pedersen.
It is, moreover, neither strange nor unexampled that popular ballads
should be affected by tradition committed to print as well as by
tradition still floating in memory. The F[:a]r[:o]e copies of 'Greve
Genselin,' for example, as Grundtvig remarks, I, 223, note, though
undoubtedly original and independent of Danish, evince acquaintance
with Vedel's printed text.

[265] Given, with an English translation by Professor Rhys, in Sechs
Bearbeitungen, p. 1, p. 19.

[266] There are some variations in the list of relics in the other
versions. The R['i]mur say "many," without specifying.

[267] On the way from Jerusalem to Constantinople the French, according
to Galien, were waylaid by several thousand Saracens. Three or four of
the peers prepared for a fight, though armed only with swords ("which
they never or only most reluctantly put off," Arsenal MS.), but Charles
and the rest felt a better confidence in the relics, and through the
prayers of the more prudent and pious of the company their foes were
turned into rocks and stones.

[268] The heir of a Scandinavian king, or earl, at the feast which
solemnized his accession, drank a bragur-full, a chief's cup or king's
toast, to the memory of his father, and then made some important vow.
This he did before he took his father's seat. The guests then made vows.
The custom seems not to have been confined to these funeral banquets.
See Vigfusson, at the word $Bragr$. Charles and his peers show their
blood.

[269] Excepting the Welsh translation, which conforms to the original,
all other versions give Bernard's gab to Turpin, and most others
Turpin's to Bernard. The Danish chronicle assigns the "grand three-horse
act" to Gerard; the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad omits it; the two manuscript Galiens
attribute it to Bernard [Berart] de Mondidier, the printed Galien to
Berenger. In these last the feat is, though enormously weighted with
armor, to leap over two horses and come down on the back of the third so
heavily as to break his bones. There are, in one version or another,
other differences as to the feats.

[270] In Galien, Hugo is exceedingly frightened by Charlemagne's fierce
demeanor and by what he is told by a recreant Frenchman who is living in
exile at his court, and rouses the city for an assault on his guests, in
which he loses two thousand of his people. A parley ensues. Hugo will
hear of no accommodation unless the gabs are performed. "Content," says
Charles, angrily, "they shall be, if you wish;" but he feels how great
the peril is, and goes to church to invoke the aid of heaven, which is
vouchsafed.

[271] Arthur is said to have "socht to the ciete of Criste," in
'Golagros and Gawane,' Madden's 'Syr Gawayne,' p. 143, v. 302. The
author probably followed the so-called Nennius, c. 63.

[272] Cf. 'Young Beichan,' where the porter has also served thirty years
and three; 'The Grene Knight,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, II, 62;
the porter in Kilhwch and Olwen, Mabinogion, II, 255 f.

[273] In Heinrich vom T[:u]rlin's Cr[^o]ne we have the following
passage, vv 3313-4888, very possibly to be found in some French
predecessor, which recalls the relations of Cornwall King and Guenever.
The queen's demeanor may be an imitation of Charlemagne's (Arthur's)
wife's bluntness, but the _liaison_ of which Cornwall boasts appears to
be vouched by no other tradition, and must be regarded as the invention
of the author of this ballad.

Arthur and three comrades return half frozen from a hunt. Arthur sits
down at the fire to warm himself. The queen taunts him: she knows a
knight who rides, winter and summer alike, in a simple shirt, chanting
love-songs the while. Arthur resolves to go out with the three the next
night to overhaul this hardy chevalier. The three attendants of the king
have an encounter with him and fare hard at his hands, but Arthur has
the advantage of the stranger, who reveals himself to the king as
Guenever's first love, by name Gasozein, and shows a token which he had
received from her.

[274]

    Under thrub chadler closed was hee.      29^2.
    The bunge of the trubchandler he burst in three.      43^2.

Being unable to make anything of thrub, trub, I am compelled to conjecture
_the rub-chadler, that rub-chandler_. The fiend is certainly closed under
a barrel or tub, and I suppose a rubbish barrel or tub. Rubb, however
derived, occurs in Icelandic in the sense of rubbish, and chalder, however
derived, is a Scottish form of the familiar chaldron. Professor Skeat,
with great probability, suggests that chadler==chaudeler, chaudi[e']re.
Caldaria _lignea_ are cited by Ducange. Cad or kad is well known in the
sense barrel, and cadiolus, cadulus, are found in Ducange. Cadler, chadler,
however, cannot be called a likely derivative from cad.

In stanza 48 the fiend, after he has been ousted from the
"trubchandler," is told to "lie still in that wall of stone," which is
perhaps his ordinary lair. The spy is concealed under a flight of stone
steps in the French poem; in "a large hollow stone in the door outside"
in the Welsh story; in a hollow pillar in Galien and the R['i]mur; in a
stone vault in the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad: Koschwitz, Karls Reise, p. 64; Sechs
Bearbeitungen, pp 29, 52, 85, 117, 153, 179.

[275] Roland's last blast splits his horn. See the citations by G.
Paris, in Romania, XI, 506 f.

[276] The first has been printed by K[:o]lbing in Koschwitz's Sechs
Bearbeitungen, as already said. The four texts were most kindly
communicated to me by Professor Grundtvig, a short time before his
lamentable death, copied by his own hand in parallel columns, with a
restoration of the order of the stanzas, which is considerably disturbed
in all, and a few necessary emendations.

[277] P['o]l, #A#, #C#, Kortunatus, #B#, i. e. Koronatus (Grundtvig).
Coronatus==clericus, tonsura seu corona clericali donatus: Ducange.

[278] The white bears and the wolf-dogs are found in another
F[:a]r[:o]e ballad, as yet unprinted, '['A]smundar skeinkjari,' where
they are subdued by an arm-ring and "rune-gold:" the white bears in a
kindred ballad, Grundtvig, No 71, #A# 4, 5, 8, 9, #C# 6, 7, 13, quelled
with a lily-twig; #E# 12, 13, with runes; and in No 70, #A# 28, #B#
27, 30. The source of this ballad is Fj[:o]lsvinnsm['a]l, which has
two watch-dogs in 13, 14. 'Kilhweh and Olwen,' Mabinogion, II, has a
similar story, and there are nine watch-dogs, at p. 277. (Grundtvig.)

[279] Romania, IX, 8 ff. The English ballad has also combined two
stories: that of the gabs with another in which a magical horse, horn,
and sword are made prize of by a favored hero.

[280] The particular for which superiority is claimed will naturally
vary. The author of Charlemagne's Journey has the good taste not to give
prominence to simple riches, but in Galien riches is from the beginning
the point. So none hath so much gold as Cornwall King. Solomon's fame is
to exceed all the kings of the earth "for riches and for wisdom;" and
although the queen of Sheba came to prove him with hard questions, she
must have had the other matter also in view, for she says, The half was
not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard:
1 Kings, x. Coming down to very late times, we observe that it is the
wealth of the Abbot of Canterbury which exposes him to a visit from the
king.

[281] The tale in the Mille et un Jours is directly from the Persian,
but the Persian is in the preface said to be a version from Indian, that
is, Sanskrit. There are two Tatar traditional versions in Radloff, IV,
120, 310, which are cited by G. Paris.

[282] Cited by G. Paris, who refers also to King Gylfi's expedition
to Asgard (an imitation of Odin's to Vaf[th]r['u][dh]nir), and sees
some resemblance to the revolving palace of King Hugo in the vanishing
mansion in which Gylfi is received in Gylfaginning; and again to
Thor's visit to the giant Geirr[:o][dh]r, Sk['a]ldskaparm['a]l, 18,
which terminates by the giant's flinging a red-hot iron bar at Thor,
who catches it and sends it back through an iron pillar, through
Geirr[:o][dh]r skulking behind the pillar, through the wall of the
house, and into the ground, a fair matching of Charlemagne's gab. (The
giant Geirr[:o][dh]r, like Cornwall King, is skilled in magic.) The
beginning of Biterolf and Dietleib also recalls that of Charlemagne's
Journey. Biterolf, a Spanish king, hears from an old palmer, who has
seen many a hero among Christians and heathens, that none is the equal
of Attila. Biterolf had thought that he himself had no superior, and
sets out with eleven chosen knights to see Etzel's court with his own
eyes. Romania, IX, 9 f.

J['a]tmundr [Hl[:o][dh]ver], a haughty emperor in Saxon-land, sitting
on his throne one day, in the best humor with himself, asks Sigur[dh]r,
his prime minister, where is the monarch that is his match. Sigur[dh]r
demurs a little: the emperor specifies his hawk, horse, and sword
as quite incomparable. That may be, says the counsellor, but his
master's glory, to be complete, requires a queen that is his peer.
The suggestion of a possible equal rouses the emperor's ire. "But
since you talk such folly, name one," he says. Sigur[dh]r names the
daughter of Hr['o]lfr [Hugo] of Constantinople, and is sent to demand
her in marriage. Magus saga jarls, ed. Cederschi[:o]ld, c. I: Wulff,

We have here again half a ballad, in seven fragments, but the essentials
of the story, which is well known from other versions, happen to be
preserved, or may be inferred.

Arthur, apparently some day after Christmas, had been encountered at
Tarn Wadling,[284] in the forest of Inglewood, by a bold baron armed
with a club, who offered him the choice of fighting, or ransoming
himself by coming back on New Year's day and bringing word what women
most desire. Arthur puts this question in all quarters, and having
collected many answers, in which, possibly, he had little confidence, he
rides to keep his day. On the way he meets a frightfully ugly woman; she
intimates that she could help him. Arthur promises her Gawain in
marriage, if she will, and she imparts to him the right answer. Arthur
finds the baron waiting for him at the tarn, and presents first the
answers which he had collected and written down. These are
contemptuously rejected. Arthur then says that he had met a lady on a
moor, who had told him that a woman would have her will. The baron says
that the misshapen lady on the moor was his sister, and he will burn her
if he can get hold of her. Upon Arthur's return he tells his knights
that he has a wife for one of them, and they ride with the king to see
her, or perhaps for her to make her choice. When they see the bride,
they decline the match in vehement terms, all but Gawain, who is somehow
led to waive "a little foul sight and misliking." She is bedded in all
her repulsiveness, and turns to a beautiful young woman. To try Gawain's
compliance further, she asks him whether he will have her in this
likeness by night only or only by day. Putting aside his own preference,
Gawain leaves the choice to her, and this is all that is needed to keep
her perpetually beautiful. For a stepmother had witched her to go on the
wild moor in that fiendly shape until she should meet some knight who
would let her have all her will. Her brother, under a like spell, was to
challenge men either to fight with him at odds or to answer his hard
question.

These incidents, with the variation that Arthur (who does not show all
his customary chivalry in this ballad) waits for Gawain's consent before
he promises him in marriage, are found in a romance, probably of the
fifteenth century, printed in Madden's Syr Gawayne, and somewhat hastily
pronounced by the editor to be "unquestionably the original of the
mutilated poem in the Percy folio."[285]

Arthur, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great
hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his
men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing
the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure,[286] who grimly told him that he
meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur
represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to
kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms
Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place
that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best; not
bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his
oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's bugle, found
him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but
after a while took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two
should ride into strange country in different directions, put the
question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a
book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought
they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it
would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting
the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good
to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should
help at need.

Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady, riding on a
richly-caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars
words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur and
told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If
he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life; otherwise, he
must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain's wife.
The king said this lay with Gawain; he would do what he could, but it
were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. "No matter," she
rejoined, "though I be foul: choice for a mate hath an owl. When thou
comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost."

The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man
he saw was Gawain, who asked how he had sped. Never so ill: he had met a
lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had
ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. "Is
that all?" said Gawain. "I will wed her once and again, though she were
the devil; else were I no friend." Well might the king exclaim, "Of all
knights thou bearest the flower!"

After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had
hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame
Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded _her_ answer.
"Some say this and some say that, but above all things women desire to
have the sovereignty; tell this to the knight; he will curse her that
told thee, for his labor is lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as
fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and
sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame
Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he
could. "Nay, nay, king," said Gromer, "thou art but a dead man." "Abide,
Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire
sovereignty." "She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell; I
pray I may see her burn on a fire." And so they parted.

Dame Ragnell was waiting for Arthur, too, and would hear of nothing but
immediate fulfillment of her bargain. She followed the king to his
court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and
plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and
early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement.
She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in
the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the
queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards.
There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person: she ate three
capons, three curlews, and great bake meats, all that was set before
her, less and more.[287]

A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided
Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. "I will
do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever
saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would not hold:
he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul by day, or
fair by day and foul by night.[288] Gawain said the choice was hard, and
left all to her. "Gramercy," said the lady, "thou shalt have me fair
both day and night." Then she told him that her step-dame had turned her
into that monstrous shape by necromancy, not to recover her own till the
best knight in England had wedded her and given her sovereignty in all
points.[289] A charming little scene follows, vv 715-99, in which Arthur
visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the fiend may have slain him.
Something of this may very likely have been in that half page of the
ballad which is lost after stanza 48.

Gower and Chaucer both have this tale, though with a different setting,
and with the variation, beyond doubt original in the story, that the man
whose life is saved by rightly answering the question has himself to
marry the monstrous woman in return for her prompting him.

Gower relates, Confessio Amantis, Book First, I, 89-104, ed. Pauli, that
Florent, nephew of the emperor, as Gawain is of Arthur, slew Branchus, a
man of high rank. Branchus's kin refrained from vengeance, out of fear
of the emperor; but a shrewd lady, grandmother to Branchus, undertook to
compass Florent's death in a way that should bring blame upon nobody.
She sent for Florent, and told him that she would engage that he should
not be molested by the family of Branchus if he could answer a question
she would ask. He was to have a proper allowance of time to find the
answer, but he was also to agree that his life should be forfeited
unless his answer were right. Florent made oath to this agreement, and
sought the opinions of the wisest people upon the subject, but their
opinions were in no accord. Considering, therefore, that he must
default, he took leave of the emperor, adjuring him to allow no revenge
to be taken if he lost his life, and went to meet his fate. But on his
way through a forest he saw an ugly old woman, who called to him to
stop. This woman told him that he was going to certain death, and asked
what he would give her to save him. He said, anything she should ask,
and she required of him a promise of marriage. That he would not give.
"Ride on to your death, then," said she. Florent began to reflect that
the woman was very old, and might be hidden away somewhere till she
died, and that there was no other chance of deliverance, and at last
pledged his word that he would marry her if it should turn out that his
life could be saved only through the answer that she should teach him.
She was perfectly willing that he should try all other shifts first, but
if they failed, then let him say that women cared most to be sovereign
in love. Florent kept back this answer as long as he could. None of his
own replies availed, and the lady who presided in judgment at last told
him that he could be allowed but one more. Then he gave the old woman's
answer, and was discharged, with a curse on her that told.[290]

The old woman was waiting for Florent, and he now had full leisure to
inspect all her points; but he was a knight, and would hold his troth.
He set her on his horse before him, rode by night and lay close by day,
till he came to his castle. There the ladies made an attempt to attire
her for the wedding, and she was the fouler for their pains. They were
married that night. He turned away from the bride; she prayed him not to
be so discourteous. He turned toward her, with a great moral effort, and
saw (for the chamber was full of light) a lady of eighteen, of
unequalled beauty. As he would have drawn her to him she forbade, and
said he must make his choice, to have her such by day or by night.
"Choose for us both," was his reply. "Thanks," quoth she, "for since you
have made me sovereign, I shall be both night and day as I am now." She
explained that, having been daughter of the king of Sicily, her
stepmother had forshapen her, the spell to hold till she had won the
love and the sovereignty of what knight passed all others in good name.

The scene of Chaucer's tale, The Wife of Bath, returns to Arthur's
court. One of the bachelors of the household, when returning from
hawking, commits a rape, for which he is condemned to death. But the
queen and other ladies intercede for him, and the king leaves his life
at the disposal of the queen. The queen, like the shrewd lady in Gower,
but with no intent to trapan the young man, says that his life shall
depend upon his being able to tell her what women most desire, and
gives him a year and a day to seek an answer. He makes extensive
inquiries, but there is no region in which two creatures can be found to
be of the same mind, and he turns homeward very downcast.

On his way through a wood he saw a company of ladies dancing, and moved
towards them, in the hope that he might learn something. But ere he came
the dancers had vanished, and all he found was the ugliest woman
conceivable sitting on the green. She asked the knight what he wanted,
and he told her it was to know what women most desire. "Plight me thy
troth to do the next thing I ask of thee, and I will tell thee." He gave
his word, and she whispered the secret in his ear.

The court assembled, the queen herself sitting as justice, and the
knight was commanded to say what thing women love best. He made his
response triumphantly; there was no dissenting voice. But as soon as he
was declared to have ransomed his life, up sprang the old woman he had
met in the wood. She had taught the man his answer, he had plighted his
word to do the first thing she asked of him, and now she asked him to
make her his wife. The promise was not disputed, but the poor youth
begged her to make some other request; to take all he had in the world,
and let him go. She would not yield, and they were married the next day.
When they have gone to bed, the old wife, "smiling ever mo," rallies her
husband for his indifference, and lectures him for objecting to
ugliness, age, and vulgar birth, which things, she says, are a great
security for him, and then gives him his election, to have her ugly and
old as she is, but true, or young and fair, with the possible
contingencies. The knight has the grace to leave the decision to her.
"Then I have the sovereignty," she says, "and I will be both fair and
good; throw up the curtain and see." Fair and young she was, and they
lived to their lives' end in perfect joy.

Chaucer has left out the step-mother and her bewitchment, and saves,
humbles, and rewards the young knight by the agency of a good fairy; for
the ugly old woman is evidently such by her own will and for her own
purposes. She is "smiling ever mo," and has the power, as she says, to
set all right whenever she pleases. Her fate is not dependent on the
knight's compliance, though his is.

The Wife of Bath's Tale is made into a ballad, or what is called a
sonnet, 'Of a Knight and a Fair Virgin,' in The Crown Garland of Golden
Roses, compiled by Richard Johnson, not far from 1600: see the Percy
Society reprint, edited by W. Chappell, vol. vi of the series, p. 68.
Upon Chaucer's story is founded Voltaire's tale, admirable in its way,
of Ce qui pla[^i]t aux Dames, 1762; of which the author writes, 1765,
November 4, that it had had great success at Fontainebleau in the form
of a comic opera, entitled La F['e]e Urg[e']le.[291] The amusing ballad
of The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter has much in common with the Wife
of Bath's Tale, and might, if we could trace its pedigree, go back to a
common original.[292]

Tales resembling the Marriage of Gawain must have been widely spread
during the Middle Ages. The ballad of 'King Henry' has much in common
with the one now under consideration, and Norse and Gaelic connections,
and is probably much earlier. At present I can add only one parallel out
of English, and that from an Icelandic saga.

Gr['i]mr was on the verge of marriage with Lopth[ae]na, but a week
before the appointed day the bride was gone, and nobody knew what
had become of her. Her father had given her a step-mother five years
before, and the step-mother had been far from kind; but what then?
Gr['i]mr was restless and unhappy, and got no tidings. A year of
scarcity coming, he left home with two of his people. After an
adventure with four trolls, he had a fight with twelve men, in which,
though they were all slain, he lost his comrades and was very badly
wounded. As he lay on the ground, looking only for death, a woman
passed, if so she might be called; for she was not taller than a child
of seven years, so stout that Gr['i]mr's arms would not go round her,
misshapen, bald, black, ugly, and disgusting in every particular. She
came up to Gr['i]mr, and asked him if he would accept his life from
her. "Hardly," said he, "you are so loathsome." But life was precious,
and he presently consented. She took him up and ran with him, as if he
were a babe, till she came to a large cave; there she set him down, and
it seemed to Gr['i]mr that she was uglier than before. "Now pay me for
saving your life," she said, "and kiss me." "I cannot," said Gr['i]mr,
"you look so diabolical." "Expect no help, then, from me," said she,
"and I see that it will soon be all over with you." "Since it must be,
loath as I am," said Gr['i]mr, and went and kissed her; she seemed
not so bad to kiss as to look at. When night came she made up a bed,
and asked Gr['i]mr whether he would lie alone or with her. "Alone,"
he answered. "Then," said she, "I shall take no pains about healing
your wounds." Gr['i]mr said he would rather lie with her, if he had no
other chance, and she bound up his wounds, so that he seemed to feel
no more of them. No sooner was Gr['i]mr abed than he fell asleep, and
when he woke, he saw lying by him almost the fairest woman he had ever
laid eyes on, and marvellously like his true-love, Lopth[ae]na. At the
bedside he saw lying the troll-casing which she had worn; he jumped up
and burned this. The woman was very faint; he sprinkled her with water,
and she came to, and said, It is well for both of us; I saved thy life
first, and thou hast freed me from bondage. It was indeed Lopth[ae]na,
whom the step-mother had transformed into a horrible shape, odious to
men and trolls, which she should never come out of till a man should
consent to three things,--which no man ever would,--to accept his
life at her hands, to kiss her, and to share her bed. Gr['i]ms saga
lo[dh]inkinna, Rafn, Fornaldar S[:o]gur, II, 143-52.

Sir Frederic Madden, in his annotations upon this ballad, 'Syr Gawayne,'
p. 359, remarks that Sir Steven, stanza 31, does not occur in the Round
Table romances; that Sir Banier, 32, is probably a mistake for Beduer,
the king's constable; and that Sir Bore and Sir Garrett, in the same
stanza, are Sir Bors de Gauves, brother of Lionel, and Gareth, or
Gaheriet, the younger brother of Gawain.

'The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,' as filled out by Percy from the fragments
in his manuscript, Reliques, 1765, III, 11, is translated by Bodmer, I,

    41
    And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,
      Was one soe mild of moode,
    Sayes, Well I know what I wold say,
      God grant it may be good!

    42
    To haue thee fowle in the night
      When I w_i_th thee shold play--
    Yet I had rather, if I might,
      Haue thee fowle in the day.

    'What! when lords goe w_i_th ther feires,' shee said,
      'Both to the ale and wine,
    Alas! then I must hyde my selfe,
      I must not goe withinne.'

    44
    And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,
      Said, Lady, that's but skill;
    And because thou art my owne lady,
      Thou shalt haue all thy will.

    45
    Then she said, Blesed be thou, gentle Gawain,

      'And amend th['e] of thy liffe;
    I sweare this is the same lady
      _Tha_t I marryed to my wiffe.'

    51
    S_i_r Kay kissed that lady bright,
      Standing vpon his ffeete;
    He swore, as he was trew knight,
      The spice was neuer soe sweete.

    52
    'Well, coz_en_ Gawaine,' sayes S_i_r Kay,
      'Thy chance is fallen arright,

      'For my vnckle Arthurs sake
    I am glad as grasse wold be of raine,

    54
    S_i_r Gawaine tooke the lady by the one arme,

    They led her straight to K_ing_ Arthur,

lines. Madden's Syr Gawayne, lxiv, lxvii, 26, 298^a-298^y.

[287] See 'King Henry,' the next ballad.

[288] The Gaelic tale of 'The Hoodie' offers a similar choice. The
hoodie, a species of crow, having married the youngest of a farmer's
three daughters, says to her, "Whether wouldst thou rather that I should
be a hoodie by day and a man at night, or be a hoodie at night and a man
by day?" The woman maintains her proper sovereignty, and does not leave
the decision to him: "'I would rather that thou wert a man by day and a
hoodie at night,' says she. After this he was a splendid fellow by day,
and a hoodie at night." Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands,
I, 63.

The having one shape by day and another by night is a common feature in
popular tales: as, to be a bear by day and a man by night, Hr['o]lfr
Kraki's Saga, c. 26, Asbj[/o]rnsen og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 41;
a lion by day and a man by night, Grimms, K. u. H. m., No 88; a crab by
day and a man by night, B. Schmidt, Griechische M[:a]rchen, u. s. w.,
No 10; a snake by day and a man by night, Karadshitch, Volksm[:a]rchen
der Serben, Nos 9, 10; a pumpkin by day and a man by night, A. & A.
Schott, Walachische M[ae]rchen, No 23; a ring by day, a man by night,
M[:u]llenhoff, No 27, p. 466, Karadshitch, No 6, Afanasief, VI, 189.
Three princes in 'Kung Lindorm,' Nicolovius, Folklifwet, p. 48 ff,
are cranes by day and men by night, the king himself being man by day
and worm by night. The double shape is sometimes implied though not
mentioned.

necromancy; so the Carl of Carlile, Percy MS., Hales & Furnivall, III,

So Sir Gawen and Dame Ragnell, vv 474 f, and our ballad, stanzas 29, 30.

[291] This was a melodrama by Favart, in four acts: reduced in 1821 to
one act, at the Gymnase.

[292] Chaucer's tale is commonly said to be derived from Gower's, but
without sufficient reason. Vv 6507-14, ed. Tyrwhitt, are close to Dame
Ragnell, 409-420. Gower may have got his from some Example-book. I have
not seen it remarked, and therefore will note, that Example-books may
have been known in England as early as 1000, for Aelfric seems to speak
slightingly of them in his treatise on the Old Testament. The Proverbs,
he says, is a "bigspellb['o]c, _n['a] swilce g['e] secga[dh]_, ac
w['i]sd['o]mes bigspell and warnung wi[dh] dysig," etc.

KING HENRY

        'King Henry.' #a.# The Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 31. #b.#
        Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1802, II, 132.


Scott describes his copy of 'King Henry' as "edited from the MS. of Mrs
Brown, corrected by a recited fragment." This MS. of Mrs Brown was
William Tytler's, in which, as we learn from Anderson's communication to
Percy (see p. 62, above), this ballad was No 11. Anderson notes that it
extended to twenty-two stanzas, the number in Scott's copy. No account
is given of the recited fragment. As published by Jamieson, II, 194, the
ballad is increased by interpolation to thirty-four stanzas. "The
interpolations will be found inclosed in brackets," but a painful
contrast of style of itself distinguishes them. They were entered by
Jamieson in his manuscript as well.

The fourteenth stanza, as now printed, the eighteenth in Jamieson's
copy, is not there bracketed as an interpolation, and yet it is not in
the manuscript. This stanza, however, with some verbal variation, is
found in Scott's version, and as it may have been obtained by Jamieson
in one of his visits to Mrs Brown, it has been allowed to stand.

Lewis rewrote the William Tytler version for his Tales of Wonder,
'Courteous King Jamie,' II, 453, No 57, and it was in this shape that
the ballad first came out, 1801.

The story is a variety of that which is found in 'The Marriage of Sir
Gawain,' and has its parallel, as Scott observed, in an episode in
Hr['o]lfr Kraki's saga; #A#, Torf[ae]us, Historia Hrolfi Krakii, c. vii,
Havni[ae], 1705; #B#, Fornaldar S[:o]gur, Rafn, I, 30 f, c. 15.

King Helgi, father of Hr['o]lfr Kraki, in consequence of a lamentable
misadventure, was living in a solitary way in a retired lodge. One
stormy Yule-night there was a loud wail at the door, after he had gone
to bed. Helgi bethought himself that it was unkingly of him to leave
anything to suffer outside, and got up and unlocked the door. There he
saw a poor tattered creature of a woman, hideously misshapen, filthy,
starved, and frozen (#A#), who begged that she might come in. The king
took her in, and bade her get under straw and bearskin to warm herself.
She entreated him to let her come into his bed, and said that her life
depended on his conceding this boon. "It is not what I wish," replied
Helgi, "but if it is as thou sayest, lie here at the stock, in thy
clothes, and it will do me no harm." She got into the bed, and the king
turned to the wall. A light was burning, and after a while the king took
a look over his shoulder; never had he seen a fairer woman than was
lying there, and not in rags, but in a silk kirtle. The king turned
towards her now, and she informed him that his kindness had freed her
from a weird imposed by her stepmother, which she was to be subject to
till some king had admitted her to his bed, #A#. She had asked this
grace of many, but no one before had been moved to grant it.

Every point of the Norse saga, except the stepmother's weird, is found
in the Gaelic tale 'Nighean Righ fo Thuinn,' 'The Daughter of King
Under-waves,' Campbell's Popular Tales of the West Highlands, No lxxxvi,
III, 403 f.

The Finn were together one wild night, when there was rain and snow. An
uncouth woman knocked at Fionn's door about midnight, and cried to him
to let her in under cover. "Thou strange, ugly creature, with thy hair
down to thy heels, how canst thou ask _me_ to let thee in!" he answered.
She went away, with a scream, and the whole scene was repeated with
Oisean. Then she came to Diarmaid. "Thou art hideous," he said, "and thy
hair is down to thy heels, but come in." When she had come in, she told
Diarmaid that she had been travelling over ocean and sea for seven
years, without being housed, till he had admitted her. She asked that
she might come near the fire. "Come," said Diarmaid; but when she
approached everybody retreated, because she was so hideous. She had not
been long at the fire, when she wished to be under Diarmaid's blanket.
"Thou art growing too bold," said he, "but come." She came under the
blanket, and he turned a fold of it between them. "She was not long
thus, when he gave a start, and he gazed at her, and he saw the finest
drop of blood that ever was, from the beginning of the universe till the
end of the world, at his side."

Mr Campbell has a fragment of a Gaelic ballad upon this story, vol.
xvii., p. 212 of his manuscript collection, 'Collun gun Cheann,' or 'The
Headless Trunk,' twenty-two lines. In this case, as the title imports, a
body without a head replaces the hideous, dirty, and unkempt
draggle-tail who begs shelter of the Finn successively and obtains her
boon only from Diarmaid. See Campbell's Gaelic Ballads, p. ix.

The monstrous deformity of the woman is a trait in the ballad of 'The
Marriage of Sir Gawain,' and related stories, and is described in these
with revolting details. Her exaggerated appetite also is found in the
romance of The Wedding of Sir Gawen and Dame Ragnell, see p. 290. The
occasion on which she exhibits it is there the wedding feast, and the
scene consequently resembles, even more closely there than here, what
we meet with in the Danish ballads of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, No
16, I, 222, and 'Tord af Havsgaard,' Grundtvig, No 1, I, 1, IV, 580
(==Kristensen, 'Thors Hammer,' I, 85, No 35) the latter founded on the
[th]rymskvi[dh]a, or Hamarsheimt, of the older Edda. In a Norwegian
version of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, IV, 732, the feats of eating
and drinking are performed not by the bride, but by an old woman who
acts as bridesmaid, br['u]rekvinne.[293]

A maid who submits, at a linden-worm's entreaty, to lie in the same bed
with him, finds a king's son by her side in the morning: Grundtvig,
'Lindormen,' No 65, #B#, #C#, II, 213, III, 839; Kristensen, I, 195, No
71; Afzelius, III, 121, No 88; Arwidsson, II, 270, No 139; Hazelius, Ur
de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 117, and p. 149. In 'Ode und de Slang','
M[:u]llenhoff, Sagen u. s. w., p. 383, a maid, without much reluctance,
lets a snake successively come into the house, into her chamber, and
finally into her bed, upon which the snake changes immediately into a
prince.

Scott's copy is translated by Schubart, p. 127, and by Gerhard, p. 129;

All these versions of 'Kempy Kay' are known, or may be presumed, to have
been taken down within the first three decades of this century; #A# is
traced as many years back into the last. The fourth stanza of #A#
clearly belongs to some other ballad. Both #A# and #B# appear to have
undergone some slight changes when published by Sharpe and Kinloch
respectively. Some verses from this ballad have been adopted into one
form of a still more unpleasant piece in the Campbell collection,
concerning a wife who was "the queen of all sluts."[294]

Sharpe remarks: "This song my learned readers will perceive to be of
Scandinavian origin, and that the wooer's name was probably suggested by
Sir Kaye's of the Round Table.... The description of Bengoleer's
daughter resembles that of the enchanted damsel who appeared to
courteous King Henrie." It is among possibilities that the ballad was an
outgrowth from some form of the story of The Marriage of Sir Gawain, in
the Percy version of which the "unseemly" lady is so rudely commented on
and rejected by Kay. This unseemly lady, in The Wedding of Gawen and
Dame Ragnell, and her counterpart in 'King Henry,' who is of superhuman
height, show an extravagant voracity which recalls the giantess in
'Greve Genselin.' In 'Greve Genselin,' a burlesque form of an heroic
ballad which is preserved in a pure shape in three F[:a]r[:o]e versions
(Grundtvig, IV, 737-42), there are many kemps invited to the wedding,
and in a little dance which is had the smallest kemp is fifteen ells to
[below] the knee, Grundtvig, No 16, #A# 26, #B# 29, #C# 29. Kempy Kay
has gigantic dimensions in #A# 7, #C# 9, #E# 7: teeth like
tether-stakes, a nose three [nine, five] feet long, three ells [nine
yards] between his shoulders, a span between his eyne.[295] Of the bride
it is said in #A# 12 that her finger nails were like the teeth of a rake
and her teeth like tether-stakes. This is not decisive; it is her
ugliness, filthiness, and laziness that are made most of. We may assume
that she would be in dimension and the shape of nature a match for the
kemp, but she does not comport herself especially like a giantess.

If Kempy Kay be the original name of the wooer, Knapperty and Chickmakin
might easily be derived from corrupt pronunciations like Kampeky,
Kimpaky.

        fragment."


It is not, perhaps, material to explain how Owain, "the king's son
Urien," happens to be awarded the adventure which here follows. It is
enough that his right is as good as that of other knights to whom the
same achievement has been assigned, though the romance, or, as the
phrase used to be, "the book," says nothing upon the subject. Owain's
slaying the fire-drake who was getting the better of the lion may have
led to his name becoming associated with the still more gallant exploit
of thrice kissing a fire-drake to effect a disenchantment. The ring in
#A# 9 might more plausibly be regarded as being a repetition of that
which Owain's lady gave him on leaving her for a twelvemonth's outing, a
ring which would keep him from loss of blood, and also from prison,
sickness, and defeat in battle--in short, preserve him against all the
accidents which the knight suggested might prevent his holding his
day--provided that he had it by him and thought on her. Ritson, Ywaine
and Gawin, vv 1514-38.

But an Icelandic saga comes near enough to the story of the ballad as
given in #A# to show where its connections lie. Als['o]l and a brother
and sister are all transformed by a stepmother, a handsome woman, much,
younger than her husband. Als['o]l's heavy weird is to be a nondescript
monster with a horse's tail, hoofs, and mane, white eyes, big mouth,
and huge hands, and never to be released from the spell till a king's
son shall consent to kiss her. One night when Hj['a]lmt[e']r had landed
on a woody island, and it had fallen to him to keep watch, he heard
a great din and crashing in the woods, so that the oaks trembled.
Presently this monster came out of the thicket with a fine sword in
her hand, such as he had not seen the like of. They had a colloquy,
and he asked her to let him have the sword. She said he should not
have it unless he would kiss her. "I will not kiss thy snout," said
Hj['a]lmt[e']r, "for mayhap I should stick to it." But something came
into his mind which made him think better of her offer, and he said
he was ready. "You must leap upon my neck, then," she said, "when I
throw up the sword, and if you then hesitate, it will be your death."
She threw up the sword, he leaped on her neck and kissed her, and she
gave him the sword, with an augury of victory and good luck for him
all his days. The retransformation does not occur on the spot, but
further on Hj['a]lmt[e']r meets ['A]ls['o]l as a young lady at the
court of her brother, who has also been restored to his proper form and
station; everything is explained; Hj['a]lmt[e']r marries her, and his
foster-brother her sister. Hj['a]lmt[e']rs ok [:O]lvers Saga, cc 10,
22, Rafn, Fornaldar S[:o]gur, III, 473 ff, 514 ff.

In many tales of the sort a single kiss suffices to undo the spell and
reverse the transformation; in others, as in the ballad, three are
required. The triplication of the kiss has led in #A# to a triplication
of the talisman against wounds. The popular genius was inventive enough
to vary the properties of the several gifts, and we may believe that
belt, ring, and sword had originally each its peculiar quality. The
peril of touching fin or tail in #A# seems to correspond to that in the
saga of hesitating when the sword is thrown up.

The #Danish# ballad, 'Jomfruen i Ormeham,' from MSS of the sixteenth and
the seventeenth century, Grundtvig, No 59, II, 177, resembles both the
first version of the Scottish ballad and the Icelandic saga in the
points that the maid offers gifts and is rehabilitated by a kiss. The
maid in her proper shape, which, it appears, she may resume for a
portion of the day, stands at Sir Jenus's bedside and offers him
gifts--five silver-bowls, all the gold in her kist, twelve foals, twelve
boats--and ends with saying, "Were I a swain, as you are, I would
betroth a maid." It is now close upon midnight, and she hints that he
must be quick. But Jenus is fast asleep the while; twelve strikes, and
the maid instantly turns into a little snake. The page, however, has
been awake, and he repeats to his master all that has occurred.[296] Sir
Jenus orders his horse, rides along a hillside, and sees the little
snake in the grass. He bends over and kisses it, and it turns to a
courteous maid, who thanks him, and offers him any boon he may ask. He
asks her to be his, and as she has loved him before this, she has no
difficulty in plighting him her troth.

A maid transformed by a step-mother into a tree is freed by being kissed
by a man, in 'Jomfruen i Linden,' Grundtvig, II, 214, No 66, Kristensen,
II, 90, No 31; 'Linden,' Afzelius, III, 114, 118, No 87. In 'Linden,'
Kristensen, I, 13, No 5, a combination of two ballads, a prince cuts
down the linden, which changes to a linden-worm; he kisses the worm, and
a young maid stands before him.

A knight bewitched into the shape of a troll is restored by being kissed
by a peasant's wife thrice [once], 'Trolden og Bondens Hustru,'
Grundtvig, II, 142, No 52, #A#, #B#; a prince by a kiss from a maid,
'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, D. g. F., II, 211, No 65 #A#, 'Slangen og den
lille Pige,' Danske Folkeminder, 1861, p. 15.

The removal of a spell which compels man or woman to appear
continuously or alternately as a monster, commonly a snake, by
three kisses or by one, is a regular feature in the numerous
German tales of Schlangenjungfrauen, Weissefrauen. Often the man
is afraid to venture the third kiss, or even a single one. See

Rivals or peers of Owain among romantic knights are, first, Lanzelet, in
Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's poem, who kisses a serpent on the mouth once,
which, _after bathing in a spring_ (see 'Tam Lin'), becomes the finest
woman ever seen: vv 7836-7939. Brandimarte, again, in Orlando
Innamorato, lib. II., c. XXVI, stanzas 7-15; and Carduino, I Cantari di
Carduino, Rajna, stanzas 49, 54 f, 61-64, pp 35-41. Le Bel Inconnu is an
involuntary instrument in such a disenchantment, for the snake
fascinates him first and kisses him without his knowledge; he afterwards
goes to sleep, and finds a beautiful woman standing at his head when he
wakes: ed. Hippeau, p. 110 ff, v. 3101 ff. The English Libius Disconius
is kist or he it wist, and the dragon at once turns to a beautiful
woman: Percy MS., Hales & Furnivall, II, 493f; Ritson, Romances, II, 84
f. Espertius, in Tiran le Blanc, is so overcome with fear that he cannot
kiss the dragon,--a daughter of Hippocrates, transformed by Diana, in
the island of Lango,--but Espertius not running away, as two men before
him had done, the dragon kisses him with equally good effect: Caylus,
Tiran le Blanc, II, 334-39. This particular disenchantment had not been
accomplished down to Sir John Mandeville's time, for he mentions only
the failures: Voyage and Travel, c. iv, pp 28-31, ed. 1725. Amadis
d'Astra touches two dragons on the face and breast, and restores them to
young-ladyhood: Historia del Principe Sferamundi, the 13th book of
Amadis of Gaul, P. II, c. xcvii, pp 458-462, Venice, 1610. This feat is
shown by the details to be only a variation of the story in Tiran le
Blanc.[298]

The Rev. Mr Lamb, of Norham, communicated to Hutchinson, author of 'A
View of Northumberland,' a ballad entitled 'The Laidley Worm of
Spindleston Heughs,' with this harmless preamble: "A song 500 years old,
made by the old Mountain Bard, Duncan Frasier, living on Cheviot, A.D.
1270. From an ancient manuscript." This composition of Mr Lamb's--for
nearly every line of it is his--is not only based on popular tradition,
but evidently preserves some small fragments of a popular ballad, and
for this reason is given in an Appendix. There is a copy deviating but
very little from the print in Kinloch's MSS, I, 187. It was obtained
from the recitation of an old woman in Berwickshire.[299] In this
recited version the Child of Wynd, or Childy Wynd (Child O-wyne), has
become Child o Wane (Child O-wayn).

Mr R.H. Evans, in his preface to this ballad, Old Ballads, 1810, IV,
241, says that Mr Turner had informed him "that a lady upwards of
seventy had heard her mother repeat an older and nearly similar ballad."

    Her mother died when she was young,
      Which gave her cause to make great moan;

      I swear my brand your death shall be.'

    12
    He stepped in, gave her a kiss,
      The royal brand he brought him wi;
    Her breath was sweet, her hair grew short,
      And twisted nane about the tree,
    And smilingly she came about,
      As fair a woman as fair could be.

[296] The incident of a woman trying to move a man who all the while is
in a deep sleep, and of his servant reporting what has been going on,
can hardly have belonged to this ballad from the beginning. It is
exceedingly common in popular tales: see 'The Red Bull of Norroway,' in
Chambers's Popular Rhymes of Scotland, 3d ed., p. 99; Grimms, 'Das
singende springende L[:o]weneckerchen,' No 88, 'Der Eisenhofen,' No 127,
and the notes in vol. iii; Leskien u. Brugman, Litanische V. l. u.
M[:a]rchen, 'Vom weissen Wolf,' No 23, p. 438, and Wollner's note, p. 571.

[297] But not in Mme Villeneuve's or in Mme de Beaumont's 'La Belle et
la B[^e]te.'

[298] Lanzelet is cited by J. Grimm; Brandimarte by Walter Scott;
Carduino by G. Paris; Espertius by Dunlop; Amadis d'Astra by Valentin
Schmidt. Dunlop refers to a similar story in the sixth tale of the
Contes Amoureux de Jean Flore, written towards the end of the fifteenth
century.

[299] "The Childe of Wane, as a protector of disconsolate damsels, is
still remembered by young girls at school in the neighborhood of
Bamborough, who apply the title to any boy who protects them from the
assaults of their school-fellows." (Kinloch.)


APPENDIX

THE LAIDLEY WORM OF SPINDLESTON HEUGHS.

        A View of Northumberland, by W. Hutchinson, Anno 1776,
        Newcastle, 1778, II, 162-64. Communicated by the Rev. Mr
        Lamb, of Norham.

Kinloch's account of the tradition in relation to the queen, as it
maintains itself in Berwickshire, is quite in accord with German _sagen_
about enchanted ladies, innocent or guilty, and as such may be worth
giving: Kinloch MSS, I, 187.

"Though the ballad mentions that the queen was transformed into 'a
spiteful toad of monstrous size,' and was doomed in that form to wend on
the earth until the end of the world, yet the tradition of the country
gives another account of the endurance of her enchantment. It is said
that in form of a toad as big as a 'clockin hen' she is doomed to
expiate her guilt by confinement in a cavern in Bamborough castle, in
which she is to remain in her enchanted shape until some one shall have
the hardihood to break the spell by penetrating the cavern, whose
'invisible' door only opens every seven years, on Christmas eve. The
adventurer, after entering the cavern, must take the sword and horn of
the Childe of Wane, which hang on the wall, and having unsheathed and
resheathed the sword thrice, and wound three blasts on the horn, he must
kiss the toad three times; upon which the enchantment will be dissolved,
and the queen will recover her human form.

"Many adventurers, it is said, have attempted to disenchant the queen,
but have all failed, having immediately fallen into a trance, something
similar to the princes in the Arabian tale who went in search of the
Talking Bird, Singing Tree, and Yellow Water. The last one, it is said,
who made the attempt was a countryman, about sixty years ago, who,
having watched on Christmas eve the opening of the door, entered the
cavern, took the sword and horn from the wall, unsheathed and resheathed
the sword thrice, blew three blasts on the horn, and was proceeding to
the final disenchantment by kissing the toad, which he had saluted
twice, when, perceiving the various strange sleepers to arise from the
floor, his courage failed, and he fled from the cavern, having just
attained the outside of the door when it suddenly shut with a loud clap,
catching hold of the skirt of his coat, which was torn off and left in
the door.

    And none since that time
    To enter the cavern presume."

    1
    The king is gone from Bambrough castle,
      Long may the princess mourn;
    Long may she stand on the castle wall,
      Looking for his return.

    2
    She has knotted the keys upon a string,
      And with her she has them taen,
    She has cast them oer her left shoulder,
      And to the gate she is gane.

    3
    She tripped out, she tripped in,
      She tript into the yard;
    But it was more for the king's sake,
      Than for the queen's regard.

    4
    It fell out on a day the king
      Brought the queen with him home,
    And all the lords in our country
      To welcome them did come.

    5
    'O welcome, father,' the lady cries,
      'Unto your halls and bowers;
    And so are you, my stepmother,
      For all that is here is yours.'

    6
    A lord said, wondering while she spake,
      This princess of the North
    Surpasses all of female kind
      In beauty and in worth.

    7
    The envious queen replied: At least,
      You might have excepted me;
    In a few hours I will her bring
      Down to a low degree.

    8
    I will her liken to a laidley worm,
      That warps about the stone,
    And not till Childy Wynd comes back
      Shall she again be won.

    9
    The princess stood at the bower door,
      Laughing, who could her blame?
    But eer the next day's sun went down,
      A long worm she became.

    10
    For seven miles east, and seven miles west,
      And seven miles north and south,
    No blade of grass or corn could grow,
      So venomous was her mouth.

    11
    The milk of seven stately cows--
      It was costly her to keep--
    Was brought her daily, which she drank
      Before she went to sleep.

    12
    At this day may be seen the cave
      Which held her folded up,
    And the stone trough, the very same
      Out of which she did sup.

    13
    Word went east, and word went west,
      And word is gone over the sea,
    That a laidley worm in Spindleston Heughs
      Would ruin the north country.

    14
    Word went east, and word went west,
      And over the sea did go;
    The Child of Wynd got wit of it,
      Which filled his heart with woe.

    15
    He called straight his merry men all,
      They thirty were and three:
    'I wish I were at Spindleston,
      This desperate worm to see.

    16
    'We have no time now here to waste,
      Hence quickly let us sail;
    My only sister Margaret,
      Something, I fear, doth ail.'

    17
    They built a ship without delay,
      With masts of the rown tree,
    With fluttering sails of silk so fine,
      And set her on the sea.

    18
    They went aboard; the wind with speed
      Blew them along the deep;
    At length they spied an huge square tower,
      On a rock high and steep.

    19
    The sea was smooth, the weather clear;
      When they approached nigher,
    King Ida's castle they well knew,
      And the banks of Bambroughshire.

    20
    The queen looked out at her bower-window,
      To see what she could see;
    There she espied a gallant ship,
      Sailing upon the sea.

    21
    When she beheld the silken sails,
      Full glancing in the sun,
    To sink the ship she sent away
      Her witch-wives every one.

    22
    Their spells were vain; the hags returned
      To the queen in sorrowful mood,
    Crying that witches have no power
      Where there is rown-tree wood.

    23
    Her last effort, she sent a boat,
      Which in the haven lay,
    With armed men to board the ship,
      But they were driven away.

    24
    The worm leapt up, the worm leapt down,
      She plaited round the stane;
    And ay as the ship came to the land
      She banged it off again.

    25
    The Child then ran out of her reach
      The ship on Budle sand,
    And jumping into the shallow sea,
      Securely got to land.

    26
    And now he drew his berry-brown sword,
      And laid it on her head,
    And swore, if she did harm to him,
      That he would strike her dead.

    27
    'O quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,
      And give me kisses three;
    For though I am a poisonous worm,
      No hurt I will do to thee.

    28
    'O quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,
      And give me kisses three;
    If I am not won eer the sun go down,
      Won I shall never be.'

    29
    He quitted his sword, he bent his bow,
      He gave her kisses three;
    She crept into a hole a worm,
      But stept out a lady.

    30
    No cloathing had this lady fine,
      To keep her from the cold;
    He took his mantle from him about,
      And round her did it fold.

    31
    He has taken his mantle from him about,
      And it he wrapt her in,
    And they are up to Bambrough castle,
      As fast as they can win.

    32
    His absence and her serpent shape
      The king had long deplored;
    He now rejoiced to see them both
      Again to him restored.

    33
    The queen they wanted, whom they found
      All pale, and sore afraid,
    Because she knew her power must yield
      To Childy Wynd's, who said:

    34
    'Woe be to thee, thou wicked witch,
      An ill death mayest thou dee;
    As thou my sister hast likened,
      So likened shalt thou be.

    35
    'I will turn you into a toad,
      That on the ground doth wend,
    And won, won shalt thou never be,
      Till this world hath an end.'

    36
    Now on the sand near Ida's tower,
      She crawls a loathsome toad,
    And venom spits on every maid
      She meets upon her road.

    37
    The virgins all of Bambrough town
      Will swear that they have seen
    This spiteful toad, of monstrous size,
      Whilst walking they have been.

    38
    All folks believe within the shire
      This story to be true,
    And they all run to Spindleston,
      The cave and trough to view.

    39
    This fact now Duncan Frasier,
      Of Cheviot, sings in rhime,
    Lest Bambroughshire men should forget
      Some part of it in time.

ALLISON GROSS

        'Allison Gross,' Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 40.


'Allison Gross' was printed by Jamieson, Popular Ballads, II, 187,
without deviation from the manuscript save in spelling.

In a Greek tale, a nereid, that is elf or fairy, turns a youth who had
refused to espouse her into a snake, the curse to continue till he finds
another love who is as fair as she: 'Die Sch[:o]nste,' B. Schmidt,
Griechische M[:a]rchen, etc., No 10. This tale is a variety of 'Beauty and
the Beast,' one of the numerous wild growths from that ever charming
French story.[300]

An elf, a hill-troll, a mermaid, make a young man offers of splendid
gifts, to obtain his love or the promise of his faith, in 'Elveskud,'
Grundtvig, No 47, many of the Danish and two of the Norwegian copies;
'Hertig Magnus och Elfvorna,' Afzelius, III, 172; 'Hr. Magnus og
Bj[ae]rgtrolden,' Grundtvig, No 48, Arwidsson, No 147 B; 'Herr Magnus och
Hafstrollet,' Afzelius, No 95, Bugge, No 11; a lind-worm, similarly, to
a young woman, 'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, No 65. Magnus answers the
hill-troll that he should be glad to plight faith with her were she like
other women, but she is the ugliest troll that could be found:
Grundtvig, II, 121, #A# 6, #B# 7; Arwidsson, II, 303, #B# 5; Afzelius,
III, 169, st. 5, 173, st. 6. This is like what we read in stanza 7 of
our ballad, but the answer is inevitable in any such case. Magnus comes
off scot-free.

The queen of the fairies undoing the spell of the witch is a remarkable
feature, not paralleled, so far as I know, in English or northern
tradition. The Greek nereids, however, who do pretty much everything,
good or bad, that is ascribed to northern elves or fairies, and even
bear an appellation resembling that by which fairies are spoken of in
Scotland and Ireland, "the good damsels," "the good ladies," have a
queen who is described as taking no part in the unfriendly acts of her
subjects, but as being kindly disposed towards mankind, and even as
repairing the mischief which subordinate sprites have done against her
will. If now the fairy queen might interpose in behalf of men against
her own kith and kin, much more likely would she be to exert herself to
thwart the malignity of a witch.[301]

The object of the witch's blowing thrice on a grass-green horn in 8^2 is
not clear, for nothing comes of it. In the closely related ballad which
follows this, a witch uses a horn to summon the sea-fishes, among whom
there is one who has been the victim of her spells. The horn is
appropriate. Witches were supposed to blow horns when they joined the
wild hunt, and horn-blower, "hornbl[^a]se," is twice cited by Grimm as an
equivalent to witch: Deutsche Mythologie, p. 886.

    1
    O Allison Gross, that lives in yon towr,
      The ugliest witch i the north country,
    Has trysted me ae day up till her bowr,
      An monny fair speech she made to me.

    2
    She stroaked my head, an she kembed my hair,
      An she set me down saftly on her knee;
    Says, Gin ye will be my lemman so true,
      Sae monny braw things as I woud you gi.

    3
    She showd me a mantle o red scarlet,
      Wi gouden flowrs an fringes fine;
    Says, Gin ye will be my lemman so true,
      This goodly gift it sal be thine.

    4
    'Awa, awa, ye ugly witch,
      Haud far awa, an lat me be;
    I never will be your lemman sae true,
      An I wish I were out o your company.'

    5
    She neist brought a sark o the saftest silk,
      Well wrought wi pearles about the ban;
    Says, Gin you will be my ain true love,
      This goodly gift you sal comman.

    6
    She showd me a cup of the good red gold,
      Well set wi jewls sae fair to see;
    Says, Gin you will be my lemman sae true,
      This goodly gift I will you gi.

    7
    'Awa, awa, ye ugly witch,
      Had far awa, and lat me be;
    For I woudna ance kiss your ugly mouth
      For a' the gifts that ye coud gi.'

    8
    She's turnd her right and roun about,
      An thrice she blaw on a grass-green horn,
    An she sware by the meen and the stars abeen,
      That she'd gar me rue the day I was born.

    9
    Then out has she taen a silver wand,
      An she's turnd her three times roun an roun;
    She's mutterd sich words till my strength it faild,
      An I fell down senceless upon the groun.

    10
    She's turnd me into an ugly worm,
      And gard me toddle about the tree;
    An ay, on ilka Saturdays night,
      My sister Maisry came to me,

    11
    Wi silver bason an silver kemb,
      To kemb my heady upon her knee;
    But or I had kissd her ugly mouth,
      I'd rather a toddled about the tree.

    12
    But as it fell out on last Hallow-even,
      When the seely court was ridin by,
    The queen lighted down on a gowany bank,
      Nae far frae the tree where I wont to lye.

    13
    She took me up in her milk-white han,
      An she's stroakd me three times oer her knee;
    She chang'd me again to my ain proper shape,
     An I nae mair maun toddle about the tree.

THE LAILY WORM AND THE MACHREL OF THE SEA

        Skene MS., p. 30: taken down from recitation in the north
        of Scotland, in 1802 or 1803.


Somewhat mutilated, and also defaced, though it be, this ballad has
certainly never been retouched by a pen, but is pure tradition. It has
the first stanza in common with 'Kemp Owyne,' and shares more than that
with 'Allison Gross.' But it is independent of 'Allison Gross,' and has
a far more original sound.

Maisry's services in washing and combing are more conceivable when
rendered by a maid in her proper shape, as in 'Allison Gross,' than when
attributed to a machrel of the sea; and it is likely that the machrel
returned to her own figure every Saturday, and that this is one of the
points lost from the story. It is said, here as in 'Allison Gross,' that
Maisry kames the laily head on her knee.[302] It would be a mere cavil
to raise a difficulty about combing a laily worm's head. The fiery beast
in 'Kemp Owyne,' #A#, has long hair, and the laily worm may have had
enough to be better for combing.[303]

It is only natural that the transformed maid should not wish to trust
herself again in the hands of the stepmother, but it is not according to
poetical justice that she should remain a machrel of the sea, and here
again we may suppose something to have dropped out.

We have had a double transformation, of sister and brother, in the
'Marriage of Gawain' and in the 'Wedding of Gawen and Dame Ragnell,' and
again, with a second sister added, in the story of ['A]ls['o]l. Brother and
sister are transformed in the Danish 'Nattergalen,' Grundtvig, No 57. It
is an aggravation of stepmother malice that the victim of enchantment,
however amiable and inoffensive before, should become truculent and
destructive; so with the brother of Gawain's bride, and with the Carl of
Carlile. The stepmother is satisfactorily disposed of, as she is in
'Kemp Owyne,' #B#, and the 'Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heughs.'

[302] Dives, in one version of a well-known carol, has "a place prepared

is a very different thing from an old ballad, which, it is hoped, no one
will think capable of fatuity.

#A# is one of the nine ballads transmitted to Alexander Fraser Tytler by
Mrs Brown in April, 1800, as written down from her recollection.[304]
This copy was printed by Jamieson, II, 7, in his preface to 'True Thomas
and the Queen of Elfland.' #B#, never published as yet, has been
corrupted here and there, but only by tradition. #C# being compounded of
#A# and another version, that portion which is found in #A# is put in
smaller type.

Thomas of Erceldoune, otherwise Thomas the Rhymer, and in the popular
style True Thomas, has had a fame as a seer, which, though progressively
narrowed, is, after the lapse of nearly or quite six centuries, far from
being extinguished. The common people throughout the whole of Scotland,
according to Mr Robert Chambers (1870), continue to regard him with
veneration, and to preserve a great number of his prophetic sayings,
which they habitually seek to connect with "dear years" and other
notable public events.[305] A prediction of Thomas of Erceldoune's is
recorded in a manuscript which is put at a date before 1320, and he is
referred to with other soothsayers in the Scalacronica, a French
chronicle of English history begun in 1355. Erceldoune is spoken of as a
poet in Robert Mannyng's translation of Langtoft's chronicle, finished
in 1338; and in the Auchinleck copy of 'Sir Tristrem,' said to have been
made about 1350, a Thomas is said to have been consulted at Er[th]eldoun
touching the history of Tristrem. So that we seem safe in holding that
Thomas of Erceldoune had a reputation both as prophet and poet in the
earlier part of the fourteenth century. The vaticinations of Thomas are
cited by various later chroniclers, and had as much credit in England as
in Scotland. "During the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
centuries," says Chambers, "to fabricate a prophecy in the name of
Thomas the Rhymer appears to have been found a good stroke of policy on
many occasions. Thus was his authority employed to countenance the views
of Edward III against Scottish independence, to favor the ambitious
views of the Duke of Albany in the minority of James V, and to sustain
the spirits of the nation under the harassing invasions of Henry VIII."
During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the accomplishment of Thomas's as
then unfulfilled predictions was looked for by many. His prophecies, and
those of other Scotch soothsayers, were consulted, says Lord Hailes,
"with a weak if not criminal curiosity." Even as late as the French
revolutionary war a rhyme of Thomas's caused much distress and
consternation in the border counties of Scotland, where people were
fearing an invasion. The 'Whole Prophecie' of Merlin, Thomas Rymour, and
others, collected and issued as early as 1603, continued to be printed
as a chap-book down to the beginning of this century, when, says Dr
Murray, few farm-houses in Scotland were without a copy of it.

All this might have been if Thomas of Erceldoune had been not more
historical than Merlin. But the name is known to have belonged to a real
person. Thomas Rymor de Ercildune is witness to a deed whereby one
Petrus de Haga obliges himself to make a certain payment to the Abbey of
Melrose. Petrus de Haga is, in turn, witness to a charter made by
Richard de Moreville. Unluckily, neither of these deeds is dated. But
Moreville was constable of Scotland from 1162 to 1189. If we suppose
Moreville's charter to have been given towards 1189, and Haga to have
been then about twenty years old, and so born about 1170, and further
suppose Haga to have made his grant to Melrose towards the end of a life
of threescore, or three score and ten, the time of Thomas Rymer's
signature would be about 1230 or 1240. If Thomas Rymer was then twenty
years of age, his birth would have been at 1210 or 1220. In the year
1294 Thomas de Ercildoun, son and heir of Thomas Rymour de Ercildoun,
conveyed to a religious house his inheritance of lands in Ercildoun.
With Thomas Rhymer in mind, one naturally interprets Thomas Rymour as
the prophet and Thomas de Ercildoun as his son. If Rymour was the
surname of this family,[306] it would have been better, for us at least,
if the surname had been subjoined to the first Thomas also. As the
language stands, we are left to choose among several possibilities.
Thomas the Rhymer may have been dead in 1294; Thomas Rymour, meaning the
same person, may have made this cession of lands in 1294, and have
survived still some years. Thomas, the father, may, as Dr Murray
suggests, have retired from the world, but still be living, and it may
be his son who resigns the lands. Blind Harry's Life of Wallace makes
Thomas Rimour to be alive down to 1296 or 1297. A story reported by
Bower in his continuation of Fordun, c. 1430, makes Thomas to have
predicted the death of Alexander III in 1286, when, according to the
previous (necessarily very loose) calculation, the seer would have been
between sixty-six and seventy-six. Neither of these last dates is
established by the strongest evidence, but there is no reason for
refusing to admit, at least, that Thomas of Erceldoune may have been
alive at the latter epoch.

Thomas of Erceldoune's prophetic power was a gift of the queen of the
elves; the modern elves, equally those of northern Europe and of Greece,
resembling in respect to this attribute the nymphs of the ancient
Hellenic mythology. How Thomas attained this grace is set forth in the
first of three fits of a poem which bears his name. This poem has come
down in four somewhat defective copies: the earliest written a little
before the middle of the fifteenth century, two others about 1450, the
fourth later. There is a still later manuscript copy of the second and
third fits.[307] All the manuscripts are English, but it is manifest
from the nature of the topics that the original poem was the work of a
Scotsman. All four of the complete versions speak of an older story:
'gyff it be als the storye sayes,' v. 83, 'als the storye tellis full
ryghte,' v. 123. The older story, if any, must be the work of Thomas.
The circumstance that the poem, as we have it, begins in the first
person, and after a long passage returns for a moment to the first
person, though most of the tale is told in the third, is of no
importance; nor would it have been important if the whole narrative had
been put into Thomas's mouth, since that is the simplest of literary
artifices.

Thomas, having found favor with the queen of Elfland, was taken with her
to that country, and there he remained more than three [seven] years.
Then the time came round when a tribute had to be paid to hell, and as
Thomas was too likely to be chosen by the fiend, the elf queen conducted
him back to the world of men. At the moment of parting Thomas desires
some token which may authenticate his having spoken with her. She gives
him the gift of soothsaying. He presses her to stay and tell him some
ferly. Upon this she begins a train of predictions, which Thomas more
than once importunes her to continue. The first two of these, the
failure of Baliol's party and the battle of Halidon Hill, 1333, stand by
themselves, but they are followed by a series in chronological order,
extending from the battle of Falkirk to the battle of Otterbourn,
1298-1388. The third fit, excepting, perhaps, a reference to Henry IV's
invasion of Scotland in 1401, seems to consist, not of predictions made
after the event, but of "adaptations of legendary prophecies,
traditionally preserved from far earlier times, and furbished up anew at
each period of national trouble and distress, in expectation of their
fulfilment being at length at hand."[308]

The older "story," which is twice referred to in the prologue to the
prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune, was undoubtedly a romance which
narrated the adventure of Thomas with the elf queen _simply_, without
specification of his prophecies. In all probability it concluded, in
accordance with the ordinary popular tradition, with Thomas's return to
fairy-land after a certain time passed in this world.[309] For the story
of Thomas and the Elf-queen is but another version of what is related of
Ogier le Danois and Morgan the Fay. Six fairies made gifts to Ogier at
his birth. By the favor of five he was to be the strongest, the bravest,
the most successful, the handsomest, the most susceptible, of knights:
Morgan's gift was that, after a long and fatiguing career of glory, he
should live with her at her castle of Avalon, in the enjoyment of a
still longer youth and never wearying pleasures. When Ogier had passed
his hundredth year, Morgan took measures to carry out her promise. She
had him wrecked, while he was on a voyage to France, on a loadstone rock
conveniently near to Avalon, which Avalon is a little way this side of
the terrestrial paradise. In due course he comes to an orchard, and
there he eats an apple, which affects him so peculiarly that he looks
for nothing but death. He turns to the east, and sees a beautiful lady,
magnificently attired. He takes her for the Virgin; she corrects his
error, and announces herself as Morgan the Fay. She puts a ring on his
finger which restores his youth, and then places a crown on his head
which makes him forget all the past. For two hundred years Ogier lived
in such delights as no worldly being can imagine, and the two hundred
years seemed to him but twenty. Christendom was then in danger, and even
Morgan thought his presence was required in the world. The crown being
taken from his head, the memory of the past revived, and with it the
desire to return to France. He was sent back by the fairy, properly
provided, vanquished the foes of Christianity in a short space, and
after a time was brought back by Morgan the Fay to Avalon.[310]

The fairy adventures of Thomas and of Ogier have the essential points in
common, and even the particular trait that the fairy is taken to be the
Virgin. The occurrence of this trait again in the ballad, viewed in
connection with the general similarity of the two, will leave no doubt
that the ballad had its source in the romance. Yet it is an entirely
popular ballad as to style,[311] and must be of considerable age, though
the earliest version (#A#) can be traced at furthest only into the first
half of the last century.

The scene of the meeting of Thomas with the elf queen is Huntly Banks
and the Eildon Tree in versions #B#, #C# of the ballad, as in the
romance.[312] Neither of these is mentioned in #A#, the reciter of which
was an Aberdeen woman. The elf-lady's costume and equipment, minutely
given in the romance (henceforth referred to as #R#), are reduced in the
ballad to a skirt of grass-green silk and a velvet mantle, #A#, and a
dapple-gray horse, #B# 2 (#R# 5), with nine and fifty bells on each tett
of its mane, #A# 2 (three bells on either side of the bridle, #R#
9).[313] Thomas salutes the fairy as queen of heaven, #A# 3, #R# 11. #B#
3 has suffered a Protestant alteration which makes nonsense of the
following stanza. She corrects his mistake in all, and in #B# 4 tells
him she is out hunting, as in #R# 16. As #C# 5 stands, she challenges
Thomas to kiss her, warning him at the same time, unnaturally, and of
course in consequence of a corrupt reading, of the danger; which Thomas
defies, #C# 6. These two stanzas in #C# represent the passage in the
romance, 17-21, in which Thomas embraces the fairy queen, and are
wanting in #A#, #B#, though not to be spared. It is contact with the
fairy that gives her the power to carry her paramour off; for carry him
off she does, and he is in great fright at having to go. The ballad is
no worse, and the romance would have been much better, for the omission
of another passage, impressive in itself, but incompatible with the
proper and original story. The elf-queen had told Thomas that he would
ruin her beauty, if he had his will, and so it came to pass: her eyes
seemed out, her rich clothing was away, her body was like the lead; and
it is while thus disfigured that she bids Thomas take leave of sun and
moon, so that his alarm is not without reason.[314] He must go with her
for seven years, #A#, #B#; only for a twelvemonth, #R#. She takes him up
behind her, #A#; she rides and he runs, #B#; she leads him in at Eldon
hill, #R#; they cross a water, he wading up to the knee, #B#, #R#. The
water is subterranean in #R#, and for three days naught is heard but the
soughing of the flood. Then they come to an orchard, #A#, #B#, #R#, and
Thomas, like to tyne for lack of food, is about to pull fruit, but is
told that the fruit is cursed, #A# 9, #B# 8;[315] if he plucks it, his
soul goes to the fire of hell, #R# 35. The fairy has made a provision of
safe bread and wine for him in the ballad, #A# 10, #B# 9, but he has
still to fast a while in the romance. #C#, which lacks this passage,
makes them ride till they reach a wide desert, and leave living land
behind, 9; and here (but in #A#, #B#, and #R# in the vicinity of the
orchard) the fairy bids Thomas lay his head on her knee, and she will
show him rare sights. These are the way to heaven, #A# 12, #B# 11, #R#
38; the way to hell, #A# 13, #B# 10, #R# 41; the road to Elfland,
whither they are going, #A# 14. #R# does not point out the road to
Elfland, but the elf-queen's castle on a high hill; and there are two
additional ferlies, the way to paradise and the way to purgatory,[316]
39, 40. Thomas, in #A# 15, is now admonished that he must hold his
tongue, for if he speaks a word he will never get back to his own
country; in #R# 44 he is told to answer none but the elf-queen, whatever
may be said to him, and this course he takes in #B# 12. But before they
proceed to the castle the lady resumes all the beauty and splendor which
she had lost, and no explanation is offered save the naive one in the
Lansdowne copy, that if she had not, the king, her consort, would have
known that she had been in fault. Now follows in #A# 15 (as recited,
here 7), #C# 15, 16, the passage through the subterranean water, which
should come before they reach the orchard, as in #B# 6, #R# 30, 31.
There is much exaggeration in the ballad: they wade through rivers in
darkness and hear the sea roaring, #C# 15, #A# 7, as in #R#, but they
also wade through red blood to the knee, #A# 7, #C# 16, and the crossing
occupies not three days, as in #R# 31, but forty days, #A# 7. In #C#
they _now_ come to the garden. Stanzas 15, 16 are out of place in #C#,
as just remarked, and 17 is entirely perverted. The cursed fruit which
Thomas is not to touch in #A# 9, #B# 8, #R# 35, is offered him by the
elf-queen as his wages, and will give him the tongue that can never
lie,--a gift which is made him in the romance at the beginning of the
second fit, when the fairy is preparing to part with him. Stanzas 18,19
of #C# are certainly a modern, and as certainly an ill-devised,
interpolation. #B# has lost the conclusion. In #A#, #C#, Thomas gets a
fairy costume, and is not seen on earth again for seven years.

The romance, after some description of the life at the elf-castle,
informs us that Thomas lived there more than three years [Cambridge MS.,
seven], and thought the time but a space of three days, an almost
moderate illusion compared with the experience of other mortals under
analogous circumstances.[317] The fairy queen then hurried him away, on
the eve of the day when the foul fiend was to come to fetch his tribute.
He was a mickle man and hend, and there was every reason to fear that he
would be chosen. She brought him again to Eldon Tree, and was bidding
him farewell. Thomas begged of her a token of his conversation with her,
and she gave him the gift of true speaking. He urged her further to tell
him some ferly, and she made him several predictions, but he would not
let her go without more and more. Finally, with a promise to meet him on
Huntly Banks when she might, she left him under the tree.

Popular tradition, as Sir Walter Scott represents, held that, though
Thomas was allowed to revisit the earth after a seven years' sojourn in
fairy-land, he was under an obligation to go back to the elf-queen
whenever she should summon him. One day while he "was making merry with
his friends in the town of Erceldoune, a person came running in, and
told, with marks of fear and astonishment, that a hart and hind had left
the neighboring forest, and were composedly and slowly parading the
street of the village. The prophet instantly arose, left his habitation,
and followed the wonderful animals to the forest, whence he was never
seen to return." He is, however, expected to come back again at some
future time.

What we learn from the adventures of Thomas concerning the perils of
dealing with fairies, and the precautions to be observed, agrees with
the general teaching of tradition upon the subject. In this matter there
is pretty much one rule for all "unco" folk, be they fairies, dwarfs,
water-sprites, devils, or departed spirits, and, in a limited way, for
witches, too. Thomas, having kissed the elf-queen's lips, must go with
her. When the dead Willy comes to ask back his faith and troth of
Margaret, and she says he must first kiss her, cheek and chin, he
replies, "If I should kiss your red, red lips, your days would not be
long."[318] When Thomas is about to pull fruit in the subterranean
garden, or paradise, the elf bids him let be: all the plagues of hell
light on the fruit of this country; "if thou pluck it, thy soul goes to
the fire of hell."[319] The queen had taken the precaution of bringing
some honest bread and wine with her for Thomas's behoof. So when Burd
Ellen's brother sets out to rescue his sister, who had been carried off
by the king of Elfland, his sage adviser enjoins him to eat and drink
nothing in fairy-land, whatever his hunger or thirst; "for if he tasted
or touched in Elfland, he must remain in the power of the elves, and
never see middle-eard again."[320] Abstinence from speech is equally
advisable, according to our ballad and to other authority: Gin ae word
you should chance to speak, you will neer get back to your ain countrie,
#A# 15. They've asked him questions, one and all, but he answered none
but that fair ladie, #B# 12. What so any man to thee say, look thou
answer none but me, #R# 44.

That eating and drinking, personal contact, exchange of speech,
receiving of gifts, in any abode of unearthly beings, including the
dead, will reduce a man to their fellowship and condition might
be enforced by a great number of examples, and has already been
abundantly shown by Professor Wilhelm M[:u]ller in his beautiful
essay, Zur Symbolik der deutschen Volkssage.[321] The popular
belief of the northern nations in this matter is more completely
shown than anywhere else in Saxo's account of King Gormo's visit to
Guthmund, and it will be enough to cite that. The Danish King Gormo,
having heard extraordinary things of the riches of Geruth (the giant
Geirr[:o][dh]r), determines to verify the reports with his own eyes,
under the guidance of Thorkill, from whom he has received them. The
land of Geruth is far to the northeast, beyond the sun and stars, and
within the realm of Chaos and Old Night. It is, in fact, a very dismal
and terrific sort of Hades. The way to it lies through the dominion
of Guthmund, Geruth's brother, which is described as a paradise,
but a paradise of the same dubious attractions as that in Thomas of
Erceldoune. Guthmund, himself a giant, receives the travellers, a
band of about three hundred, very graciously, and conducts them to
his palace. Thorkill takes his comrades apart, and puts them on their
guard: they must eat and drink nothing that is offered them, but live
on the provisions which they have brought, must keep off from the
people of the place and not touch them; if they partake of any of the
food, they will forget everything, and have to pass their lives in this
foul society. Guthmund complains that they slight his hospitality,
but Thorkill, now and always, has an excuse ready. The genial monarch
offers Gormo one of his twelve beautiful daughters in marriage, and
their choice of wives to all the rest of the train. Most of the Danes
like the proposition, but Thorkill renews his warnings. Four take the
bait, and lose all recollection of the past. Guthmund now commends the
delicious fruits of his garden, and tries every art to make the king
taste them. But he is again foiled by Thorkill, and clearly perceiving
that he has met his match, transports the travellers over the river
which separates him and his brother, and allows them to continue their
journey.[322]

        Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, II, 251, ed. 1802.

   |  1
   |  True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,
   |    A ferlie he spied wi' his ee,
   |  And there he saw a lady bright,
   |    Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.

   |  2
   |  Her shirt was o the grass-green silk,
   |     Her mantle o the velvet fyne,
   |   At ilka tett of her horse's mane
   |     Hang fifty siller bells and nine.

   |   3
   |   True Thomas, he pulld aff his cap,
   |     And louted low down to his knee:
   |   'All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven!
   |     For thy peer on earth I never did see.'

   |   4
   |   'O no, O no, Thomas,' she said,
   |     'That name does not belang to me;
   |   I am but the queen of fair Elfland,
   |     That am hither come to visit thee.

    5
    'Harp and carp, Thomas,' she said,
      'Harp and carp along wi me,
    And if ye dare to kiss my lips,
      Sure of your bodie I will be.'

    6
    'Betide me weal, betide me woe,
      That weird shall never daunton me;'
    Syne he has kissed her rosy lips,
      All underneath the Eildon Tree.

   |   7
   |   'Now, ye maun go wi me,' she said,
   |     'True Thomas, ye maun go wi me,
   |   And ye maun serve me seven years,
   |     Thro weal or woe, as may chance to be.'

   |   8
   |   She mounted on her milk-white steed,
   |     She's taen True Thomas up behind,
   |   And aye wheneer her bridle rung,
   |     The steed flew swifter than the wind.

   |   9
   |   O they rade on, and farther on--
   |     The steed gaed swifter than the wind--
   |   Untill they reached a desart wide,
   |     And living land was left behind.

   |   10
   |   'Light down, light down, now, True Thomas,
   |     And lean your head upon my knee;
   |   Abide and rest a little space,
   |     And I will shew you ferlies three.

   |   11
   |   'O see ye not yon narrow road,
   |     So thick beset with thorns and briers?
   |   That is the path of righteousness,
   |     Tho after it but few enquires.

   |   12
   |   'And see not ye that braid braid road,
   |     That lies across that lily leven?
   |   That is the path of wickedness,
   |     Tho some call it the road to heaven.

   |   13
   |   'And see not ye that bonny road,
   |     That winds about the fernie brae?
   |   That is the road to fair Elfland,
   |     Where thou and I this night maun gae.

   |   14
   |   'But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue,
   |     Whatever ye may hear or see,
   |   For, if you speak word in Elflyn land,
   |     Ye'll neer get back to your ain countrie.'

    15
    O they rade on, and farther on,
      And they waded thro rivers aboon the knee,
    And they saw neither sun nor moon,
      But they heard the roaring of the sea.

    16
    It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern light,
      And they waded thro red blude to the knee;
    For a' the blude that's shed on earth
      Rins thro the springs o that countrie.

    17
    Syne they came on to a garden green,
      And she pu'd an apple frae a tree:
    'Take this for thy wages, True Thomas,
      It will give the tongue that can never lie.'

    18
    'My tongue is mine ain,' True Thomas said;
      'A gudely gift ye wad gie to me:'
    I neither dought to buy nor sell,
      At fair or tryst where I may be.

    19
    'I dought neither speak to prince or peer,
      Nor ask of grace from fair ladye:'
    'Now hold thy peace,' the lady said,
      'For as I say, so must it be.'

    20
    He has gotten a coat of the even cloth,
      And a pair of shoes of velvet green,
    And till seven years were gane and past
      True Thomas on earth was never seen.

    1
    Als I me wente [th]is endres daye,
      Ffull faste i_n_ mynd makand my mone,
    In a mery morny_n_ge of Maye,
      By Huntle bankkes my selfe allone,

    2
    I herde [th]e jaye and [th]e throstelle,
      The mawys menyde of hir songe,
    [th]e wodewale beryde als a belle,
      That alle [th]e wode a-bowte me ronge.

    3
    Allon_n_e in longynge thus als I laye,
      Vndyre-nethe a semely tre,
    [Saw] I whare a lady gaye
      [Came ridand] ou_er_ a longe lee.

    4
    If I solde sytt to domesdaye,
      W_i_t_h_ my tonge to wrobbe and wrye,
    Certanely [th]at lady gaye
      Neu_er_ bese scho askryede for mee.

    5
    Hir palfraye was a dappill graye,
      Swylke one ne saghe I neu_er_ none;
    Als dose [th]e sonne on som_er_es daye,
      [th]_a_t faire lady hir selfe scho schone.

    6
    Hir selle it was of roelle bone,
      Ffull semely was [th]_a_t syghte to see;
    Stefly sett w_i_t_h_ p_re_cyous stones,
      And compaste all with crapotee;

    7
    Stones of oryente, grete plente.
      Hir hare abowte hir hede it hange;
    Scho rade ou_er_ [th]at lange lee;
      A whylle scho blewe, a-no[th]_er_ scho sange.

    8
    Hir garthes of nobyll sylke [th]ay were,
      The bukylls were of berelle stone,
    Hir steraps were of crystalle clere,
      And all w_i_t_h_ perelle ou_er_-by-gone.

    9
    Hir payetrelle was of irale fyne,
      Hir cropoure was of orphar[:e],
    And als clere golde hir brydill it schone;
      One aythir syde hange bellys three.

    10
    [Scho led _three_ grehoundis in a leesshe,]
      And seuen_e_ raches by hir [th]ay rone;
    Scho bare an horne abowte hir halse,
      And vndir hir belte full many a flone.

    11

    12
    Bot if I speke w_i_t_h_ [gh]one lady bryghte,

    Now sall I go w_i_t_h_ all my myghte,
      Hir for to mete at Eldoun_e_ tree.

    13
    Thomas rathely vpe he rase,
      And he rane ou_er_ [th]at mountayne hye;
    Gyff it be als the storye sayes,
      He hir mette at Eldone tree.

    14
    He knelyde down_e_ appon_e_ his knee,
      Vndir-nethe [th]at grenwode spraye,
    And sayd, Lufly ladye, rewe one mee,
      Qwene of heuen_e_, als [th]ou wele maye!

    15
    Then spake [th]at lady milde of thoghte:
      Thomas, late swylke wordes bee;
    Qwene of heuen_e_ ne am I noghte,
      Ffor I tuke neu_er_ so heghe degre.

    16
    Bote I ame of ane o[th]_er_ cou_n_tree,
      If I be payrelde moste of pryse;
    I ryde aftyre this wylde fee;
      My raches rynnys at my devyse.'

    17
    'If [th]_o_u be parelde moste of pryse,
      And here rydis thus in thy folye,
    Of lufe, lady, als [th]_o_u erte wyse,
      [TH]ou gyffe me leue to lye the bye.'

    Ffor I saye [th]e full sekirlye,

    19
    'Now, lufly ladye, rewe one mee,
      And I will eu_er_ more w_i_t_h_ the duelle;
    Here my trouthe I will the plyghte,
      Whethir [th]_o_u will in heuen_e_ or helle.'

    20
    'Mane of molde, [th]_o_u will me marre,
      But [gh]itt [th]ou sall hafe all thy will;
    And trowe it wele, [th]_o_u chewys [th]e werre,
      Ffor alle my beaute will [th]_o_u spylle.'

    21
    Down_e_ [th]an_e_ lyghte [th]at lady bryghte,
      Vndir-nethe [th]at grenewode spraye;
    And, als the storye tellis full ryghte,
      Seuen_e_ sythis by hir he laye.

    22
    Scho sayd, Man_e_, the lykes thy playe:
      Whate byrde in boure maye delle w_i_t_h_ the?
    Thou merrys me all [th]is longe daye;
      I pray the, Thomas, late me bee.

    23
    Thom_a_s stode vpe i_n_ [th]at stede,
      And he by-helde [th]at lady gaye;
    Hir hare it hange all ou_er_ hir hede,

    24
    And alle [th]e riche clothynge was a-waye,
      [TH]at he by-fore sawe i_n_ [th]at stede;
    Hir a schanke blake, hir o[th]er graye,
      And all hir body lyke the lede.

    How arte [th]_o_u fadyde [th]us i_n_ [th]e face,
      [TH]at schane by-fore als [th]e sonne so bryght[e]!

    27
    Scho sayd, Thom_a_s, take leue at sone and mon[e],
      And als at lefe [th]_a_t grewes on tree;
    This twelmoneth sall [th]_o_u w_i_t_h_ me gone,
      And medill-erthe sall [th]_o_u none see.'

    28
    He knelyd downe appon_e_ his knee,
      Vndir-nethe [th]_a_t grenewod spraye,
    And sayd, Lufly lady, rewe on mee,
      Mylde qwene of heuen_e_, als [th]_o_u beste maye!

    29
    'Allas!' he sayd, 'and wa es mee!
      I trowe my dedis wyll wirke me care;
    My saulle, Jh_e_su, by-teche I the,
      Whedir-some [th]_a_t eu_er_ my banes sall fare.'

    30
    Scho ledde hy_m_ in at Eldone hill,
      Vndir-nethe a derne lee,
    Whare it was dirke as mydnyght myrke,
      And eu_er_ [th]e wat_e_r till his knee.

      He herd bot swoghynge of [th]e flode;
    At [th]e laste he sayde, Full wa es mee!
      Almaste I dye, for fawte of f[ode.]

    32
    Scho lede hy_m_ in-till a faire herbere,
      Whare frwte was g[ro]wan[d gret plentee];
    Pere and appill, bothe ryppe [th]ay were,

    [TH]e papeioyes faste abowte gan_e_ flye,
      And throstylls sange, wolde hafe no reste.

    34
    He p_re_ssede to pulle frowte w_i_t_h_ his hande,
      Als man_e_ for fude [th]_a_t was nere faynt;
    Scho sayd, Thom_a_s, [th]_o_u late [th]am_e_ stande,

    37
    He did in hye als scho hym badde;

    Ffor hir to paye he was full glade;
      And [th]an_e_ [th]at lady to hy_m_ sayde:

in Nichols's Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth
Century, VII, 178 f.

[305] Chambers' Popular Rhymes of Scotland, 1870, pp. 211-224. See,
also, Scott's Minstrelsy, IV, 110-116, 129-151, ed. 1833. But, above
all, Dr J. A. H. Murray's Introduction to The Romance and Prophecies of
Thomas of Erceldoune, 1875.

[306] Hector Boece (1527) says the surname was Leirmont, but there is no
evidence for this that is of value. See Murray, p. xiii.

[307] The five copies have been edited by Dr J. A. H. Murray, and
printed by the Early English Text Society. A reconstructed text by Dr
Alois Brandl makes the second volume of a Sammlung englischer Denkm[:a]ler
in kritischen Ausgaben, Berlin, 1880.

[308] Murray, pp xxiv-xxvii. As might be expected, the Latin texts
corrupt the names of persons and of places, and alter the results of
battles. Dr Murray remarks: "The oldest text makes the Scots win Halidon
Hill, with the slaughter of six thousand Englishmen, while the other
texts, wise after the fact, makes the Scots lose, as they actually did."
This, and the consideration that a question about the conflict between
the families of Bruce and Baliol would not be put after 1400, when the
Baliol line was extinct, disposes Dr Murray to think that verses 326-56
of the second fit, with perhaps the first fit, the conclusion of the
poem, and an indefinite portion of fit third, may have been written on
the eve of Halidon Hill, with a view to encourage the Scots.

[309] The poem, vv 675-80, says only that Thomas and the lady did not
part for ever and aye, but that she was to visit him at Huntley banks.

[310] The relations of Thomas Rhymer and Ogier might, perhaps, be
cleared up by the poem of The Visions of Ogier in Fairy Land. The book
is thus described by Brunet, ed. 1863, IV, 173: Le premier (second
et troisi[e']me) livre des visions d'Oger le Dannoys au royaulme de
Fairie, Paris, 1542, pet. in-8, de 48 ff. Brunet adds: A la suite de
ce po[:e]me, dans l'exemplaire de la Biblioth[e']que imp['e]riale, se
trouve, Le liure des visions fantastiques, Paris, 1542, pet. in-8, de
24 ff. The National Library is not now in possession of the volume;
nor have all the inquiries I have been able to make, though most
courteously aided in France, resulted, as I hoped, in the finding of a
copy.

[311] Excepting the two satirical stanzas with which Scott's version
(#C#) concludes. "The repugnance of Thomas to be debarred the use of
falsehood when he should find it convenient," may have, as Scott says,
"a comic effect," but is, for a ballad, a miserable conceit. Both ballad
and romance are serious.

[312] Eildon Tree, the site of which is supposed now to be marked by the
Eildon Tree Stone, stood, or should have stood, on the slope of the
eastern of the three Eildon Hills. Huntly Banks are about half a mile to
the west of the Eildon Stone, on the same hill-slope. Erceldoun, a
village on the Leader, two miles above its junction with the Tweed, is
all but visible from the Eildon Stone. Murray, pp l-lii.

[313] In #B# 2, absurdly, the lady holds nine bells in her hand. Ringing
or jingling bridles are ascribed to fairies, Tam Lin, #A# 37, Cromek's
Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p. 298 ("manes hung wi whustles
that the win played on," p. 299). The fairy's saddle has a bordure of
bells in the English Launfal, Halliwell's Illustrations of Fairy
Mythology, p. 31, but not in Marie's lai. The dwarf-king Antiloie, in
Ulrich Von Eschenbach's Alexander, has bells on his bridle: Grimm,
Deutsche Mythologie, I, 385. These bells, however, are not at all
distinctive of fairies, but are the ordinary decoration of elegant
"outriders" in the Middle Ages, especially of women. In the romance of
Richard C[oe]ur de Lion, a messenger's trappings ring with five hundred
bells. Besides the bridle, bells were sometimes attached to the horse's
breastplate, to the saddle-bow, crupper, and stirrups. Conde Claros's
steed has three hundred around his breastplate. See Weber's Metrical
Romances, R.C. de Lion, vv 1514-17, 5712-14, cited by T. Wright, History
of Domestic Manners in England, 214 f; Liebrecht, Gervasius, p. 122;
K[:o]lbing, Englische Studien, III, 105; Zupitza and Varnhagen, Anglia,
III, 371, IV, 417; and particularly A. Schultz, Das h[:o]fische Leben zur
Zeit der Minnesinger, I, 235, 388-91.

[314] The original I suppose to be the very cheerful tale of Ogier, with
which the author of Thomas of Erceldoune has blended a very serious one,
without any regard to the irreconcilableness of the two. He is presently
forced to undo this melancholy transformation of the fairy, as we shall
see. Brandl, 'Thomas of Erceldoune,' p. 20, cites from Giraldus
Cambrensis, Itinerarium Cambri[ae], I, 5, a story about one Meilyr, a
Welshman, the like of which our poet had in mind. This Meilyr was a
great soothsayer, and "owed his skill to the following adventure:" Being
in company one evening with a girl for whom he had long had a passion,
desideratis amplexibus atque deliciis cum indulsisset, statim loco
puell[ae] formos[ae] formam quamdam villosam, hispidam et hirsutam, adeoque
enormiter deformem invenit, quod in ipso ejusdem aspectu dementire
c[oe]pit et insanire. Meilyr recovered his reason after several years,
through the merits of the saints, but always kept up an intimacy with
unclean spirits, and by their help foretold the future. It is not said
that they gave him the tongue that never could lie, but no other tongue
could lie successfully in his presence: he always saw a little devil
capering on it. He was able, by similar indications, to point out the
lies and errors of books. The experiment being once tried of laying the
Gospel of John in his lap, every devil instantly decamped. Geoffrey of
Monmouth's history was substituted, and imps swarmed all over the book
and him, too.

[315] #B# 8^{3,4} "It was a' that cursed fruit o thine beggared man and
woman in your countrie:" the fruit of the Forbidden Tree.

[316] Purgatory is omitted in the Cotton MS. of the romance, as in the
ballad.

[317] Ogier le Danois hardly exceeded the proportion of the ordinary
hyperbole of lovers: two hundred years seemed but twenty. The British
king Herla lived with the king of the dwarfs more than two hundred
years, and thought the time but three days: Walter Mapes, Nug[ae]
Curialium, ed. Wright, p. 16 f (Liebrecht). The strongest case, I
believe, is the exquisite legend, versified by Trench, of the monk, with
whom three hundred years passed, while he was listening to a bird's
song--as he thought, less than three hours. For some of the countless
repetitions of the idea, see Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, ed. Oesterley,
No 562, and notes, p. 537; Liebrecht's Gervasins, p. 89; W. Hertz,
Deutsche Sage im Elsass, pp 115-18, 263; A. Graf, La Leggenda del
Paradiso Terrestre, pp 26-29, 31-33, and notes; J. Koch, Die
Siebenschl[:a]ferlegende, kap. ii.

[318] In an exquisite little ballad obtained by Tommaseo from a
peasant-girl of Empoli, I, 26, a lover who had visited hell, and there
met and kissed his mistress, is told by her that he must not hope ever
to go thence. How the lover escaped in this instance is not explained.
Such things happen sometimes, but not often enough to encourage one to
take the risk.

    Sono stato all' inferno, e son tornato:
    Misericordia, la gente che c'era!
    V'era una stanza tutta illuminata,
    E dentro v'era la speranza mia.
    Quando mi vedde, gran festa mi fece,
    E poi mi disse: Dolce anima mia,
    Non ti arricordi del tempo passato,
    Quando tu mi dicevi, "anima mia?"
    Ora, mio caro ben, baciami in bocca,
    Baciami tanto ch'io contenta sia.
    [E'] tanto saporita la tua bocca!
    Di grazia saporisci anco la mia.
    Ora, mio caro ben, che m'hai baciato,
    Di qui non isperar d'andarne via.

[319] #A# 8, 9, #R# 34, 35. It was not that Thomas was about to pluck
fruit from the Forbidden Tree, though #B# understands it so: cf. #R# 32,
33. The curse of this tree seems, however, to have affected all
Paradise. In modern Greek popular poetry Paradise occurs sometimes
entirely in the sense of Hades. See B. Schmidt, Volksleben der
Neugriechen, p. 249.

[320] Jamieson, in Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 398: 'Child
Rowland and Burd Ellen.'

[321] Nieders[:a]chsische Sagen und M[:a]rchen, Schambach und
M[:u]ller, p. 373. Shakspere has this: "They are fairies; he that
speaks to them shall die;" Falstaff, in Merry Wives of Windsor, V, 5.
Ancient Greek tradition is not without traces of the same ideas. It
was Persephone's eating of the pomegranate kernel that consigned her
to the lower world, in spite of Zeus and Demeter's opposition. The
drinking of Circe's brewage and the eating of lotus had an effect on
the companions of Ulysses such as is sometimes ascribed to the food and
drink of fairies, or other demons, that of producing forgetfulness of
home: Odyssey, X, 236, IX, 97. But it would not be safe to build much
on this. A Hebrew tale makes the human wife of a demon charge a man
who has come to perform, a certain service for the family not to eat
or drink in the house, or to take any present of her husband, exactly
repeating the precautions observed in Grimm, Deutsche Sagen, Nos 41,
49: Tendlan, Das Buch der Sagen und Legenden j[:u]discher Vorzeit, p.
141. The children of Shem may probably have derived this trait in the
story from the children of Japhet. Aladdin, in the Arabian Nights, is
to have a care, above all things, that he does not touch the walls of
the subterranean chamber so much as with his clothes, or he will die
instantly. This again, by itself, is not very conclusive.

This extremely airy and sparkling little ballad varies but slightly in
the half dozen known copies. The one in the Musical Museum, No 370, p.
382, and that in Ritson's Scotish Songs, II, 139, are reprinted from
Herd.

Singularly enough, there is a poem in eight-line stanzas, in a
fourteenth-century manuscript, which stands in somewhat the same
relation to this ballad as the poem of Thomas of Erceldoune does to the
ballad of Thomas Rymer, but with the important difference that there is
no reason for deriving the ballad from the poem in this instance. There
seems to have been an intention to make it, like Thomas of Erceldoune,
an introduction to a string of prophecies which follows, but no junction
has been effected. This poem is given in an appendix.

    As I was walking mine alane,
      Between the water and the wa,
    And oh there I spy'd a wee wee mannie,
      The weeest mannie that ere I saw.

    2
    His legs they were na a gude inch lang,
      And thick and nimble was his thie;
    Between his een there was a span,
      And between his shouthers there were ells three.

    3
    I asked at this wee wee mannie
      Whare his dwelling place might be;
    The answer that he gied to me
      Was, Cum alang, and ye shall see.

    4
    So we'll awa, and on we rade,
      Till we cam to yon bonnie green;
    We lichted down to bait our horse,
      And up and started a lady syne.

    5
    Wi four and twenty at her back,
      And they were a' weell clad in green;
    Tho I had been a crowned king,
      The warst o them might ha been my queen.

    6
    So we'll awa, and on we rade,
      Till we cam to yon bonnie hall;
    The rafters were o the beaten gold,
      And silver wire were the kebars all.

    7
    And there was mirth in every end,
      And ladies dancing, ane and a,
    And aye the owre-turn o their sang
      Was 'The wee wee mannie's been lang awa.'

    As I gaed out to tak the air,
      Between Midmar and bonny Craigha,
    There I met a little wee man,
      The less o him I never saw.

    2
    His legs were but a finger lang,
      And thick and nimle was his knee;
    Between his brows there was a span,
      Between his shoulders ells three.

    3
    He lifted a stane sax feet in hight,
      He lifted it up till his right knee,
    And fifty yards and mair, I'm sure,
      I wyte he made the stane to flee.

    'O little wee man, but ye be wight!
      Tell me whar your dwelling be;'
    'I hae a bower, compactly built,
      Madam, gin ye'll cum and see.'

    Sae on we lap, and awa we rade,
      Till we come to yon little ha;
    The kipples ware o the gude red gowd,
      The reef was o the proseyla.

    Pipers were playing, ladies dancing,
      The ladies dancing, jimp and sma;
    At ilka turning o the spring,
      The little man was wearin's wa.

    I turnd about, and gae a look,
      Just at the foot o' Benachie.

The first twenty-two stanzas of #B# differ from the corresponding ones
in #A#, 1-23, omitting 16, by only a few words, and there are other
agreements in the second half of these versions. Burns's intimacy with
Robert Riddell would naturally lead to a communication from one to the
other; but both may have derived the verses that are common from the
same third party. Herd's fragment, #C#, was the earliest printed.
Scott's version, #I#, as he himself states, was compounded of the Museum
copy, Riddell's, Herd's, and "several recitals from tradition." #I b#,
the edition of 1802, contained fragments of 'The Bromfield Hill' and of
'The Wee Wee Man,' which were dropped from the later edition; but
unfortunately this later edition was corrupted with eleven new stanzas,
which are not simply somewhat of a modern cast as to diction, as Scott
remarks, but of a grossly modern invention, and as unlike popular verse
as anything can be. #I# is given according to the later edition, with
those stanzas omitted; and all that is peculiar to this version, and not
taken from the Museum, Glenriddell, or Herd, is distinguished from the
rest by the larger type. This, it will be immediately seen, is very
little.

The copy in Tales of Wonder, II, 459, is #A#, altered by Lewis. Mr
Joseph Robertson notes, Kinloch MSS, VI, 10, that his mother had
communicated to him some fragments of this ballad slightly differing
from Scott's version, with a substitution of the name True Tammas for
Tam Lane.

The Scots Magazine for October, 1818, LXXXII, 327-29, has a "fragment"
of more than sixty stanzas, composed in an abominable artificial lingo,
on the subject of this ballad, and alleged to have been taken from the
mouth of a good old peasant, who, not having heard the ballad for thirty
years, could remember no more. Thomas the Rhymer appears in the last
lines with very great distinction, but it is not clear what part he has
in the story.[323]

A copy printed in Aberdeen, 1862, and said to have been edited by the
Rev. John Burnett Pratt, of Cruden, Aberdeenshire, is made up from
Aytoun and Scott, with a number of slight changes.[324]

of Lyn' is mentioned as a dance of the same party, a little further on,
Murray, p. 66, and 'Young Thomlin' is the name of an air in a medley in
"Wood's MS.," inserted, as David Laing thought, between 1600 and 1620,
and printed in Forbes's Cantus, 1666: Stenhouse's ed. of The Scots

Sir Walter Scott relates a tradition of an attempt to rescue a woman
from fairydom which recalls the ill success of many of the efforts to
disenchant White Ladies in Germany: "The wife of a farmer in Lothian had
been carried off by the fairies, and, during the year of probation,
repeatedly appeared on Sunday, in the midst of her children, combing
their hair. On one of these occasions she was accosted by her husband;
when she related to him the unfortunate event which had separated them,
instructed him by what means he might win her, and exhorted him to exert
all his courage, since her temporal and eternal happiness depended on
the success of his attempt. The farmer, who ardently loved his wife, set
out at Halloween, and, in the midst of a plot of furze, waited
impatiently for the procession of the fairies. At the ringing of the
fairy bridles, and the wild, unearthly sound which accompanied the
cavalcade, his heart failed him, and he suffered the ghostly train to
pass by without interruption. When the last had rode past, the whole
troop vanished, with loud shouts of laughter and exultation, among which
he plainly discovered the voice of his wife, lamenting that he had lost
her forever." The same author proceeds to recount a real incident, which
took place at the town of North Berwick, within memory, of a man who was
prevented from undertaking, or at least meditating, a similar rescue
only by shrewd and prompt practical measures on the part of his
minister.[325]

This fine ballad stands by itself, and is not, as might have been
expected, found in possession of any people but the Scottish. Yet it has
connections, through the principal feature in the story, the
retransformation of Tam Lin, with Greek popular tradition older than
Homer.

Something of the successive changes of shape is met with in a
Scandinavian ballad: 'Nattergalen,' Grundtvig, II, 168, No 57; 'Den
f[:o]rtrollade Prinsessan,' Afzelius, II, 67, No 41, Atterbom, Poetisk
Kalender, 1816, p. 44; Dybeck, Runa, 1844, p. 94, No 2; Axelson,
Vandring i Wermlands Elfdal, p. 21, No 3; Lindeman, Norske
Fjeldmelodier, Tekstbilag til 1ste Bind, p. 3, No 10.

Though many copies of this ballad have been obtained from the mouth of
the people, all that are known are derived from flying sheets, of which
there is a Danish one dated 1721 and a Swedish of the year 1738. What is
of more account, the style of the piece, as we have it, is not quite
popular. Nevertheless, the story is entirely of the popular stamp, and
so is the feature in it, which alone concerns us materially. A
nightingale relates to a knight how she had once had a lover, but a
step-mother soon upset all that, and turned her into a bird and her
brother into a wolf. The curse was not to be taken off the brother till
he drank of his step-dame's blood, and after seven years he caught her,
when she was taking a walk in a wood, tore out her heart, and regained
his human shape. The knight proposes to the bird that she shall come and
pass the winter in his bower, and go back to the wood in the summer:
this, the nightingale says, the step-mother had forbidden, as long as
she wore feathers. The knight seizes the bird by the foot, takes her
home to his bower, and fastens the windows and doors. She turns to all
the marvellous beasts one ever heard of,--to a lion, a bear, a variety
of small snakes, and at last to a loathsome lind-worm. The knight makes
a sufficient incision for blood to come, and a maid stands on the floor
as fair as a flower. He now asks after her origin, and she answers,
Egypt's king was my father, and its queen my mother; my brother was
doomed to rove the woods as a wolf. "If Egypt's king," he rejoins, "was
your father, and its queen your mother, then for sure you are my
sister's daughter, who was doomed to be a nightingale."[326]

We come much nearer, and indeed surprisingly near, to the principal
event of the Scottish ballad in a Cretan fairy-tale, cited from
Chourmouzis by Bernhard Schmidt.[327] A young peasant of the village
Sgourokeph['a]li, who was a good player on the rote, used to be taken by
the nereids into their grotto for the sake of his music. He fell in love
with one of them, and, not knowing how to help himself, had recourse to
an old woman of his village. She gave him this advice: that just before
cock-crow he should seize his beloved by the hair, and hold on,
unterrified, till the cock crew, whatever forms she should assume. The
peasant gave good heed, and the next time he was taken into the cave
fell to playing, as usual, and the nereids to dancing. But as cock-crow
drew nigh, he put down his instrument, sprang upon the object of his
passion, and grasped her by her locks. She instantly changed shape;
became a dog, a snake, a camel, fire. But he kept his courage and held
on, and presently the cock crew, and the nereids vanished all but one.
His love returned to her proper beauty, and went with him to his home.
After the lapse of a year she bore a son, but in all this time never
uttered a word. The young husband was fain to ask counsel of the old
woman again, who told him to heat the oven hot, and say to his wife that
if she would not speak he would throw the boy into the oven. He acted
upon this prescription; the nereid cried out, Let go my child, dog! tore
the infant from his arms, and vanished.

This Cretan tale, recovered from tradition even later than our ballad,
repeats all the important circumstances of the forced marriage of
Thetis with Peleus. Chiron, like the old woman, suggested to his
prot['e]g['e] that he should lay hands on the nereid, and keep his
hold through whatever metamorphosis she might make. He looked out for
his opportunity and seized her; she turned to fire, water, and a wild
beast, but he did not let go till she resumed her primitive shape.
Thetis, having borne a son, wished to make him immortal; to which end
she buried him in fire by night, to burn out his human elements, and
anointed him with ambrosia by day. Peleus was not taken into counsel,
but watched her, and saw the boy gasping in the fire, which made him
call out; and Thetis, thus thwarted, abandoned the child and went back
to the nereids. Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, III, 13, 5, 6.

The Cretan tale does not differ from the one repeated by Apollodorus
from earlier writers a couple of thousand years ago more than two
versions of a story gathered from oral tradition in these days are apt
to do. Whether it has come down to our time from mouth to mouth through
twenty-five centuries or more, or whether, having died out of the
popular memory, it was reintroduced through literature, is a question
that cannot be decided with certainty; but there will be nothing
unlikely in the former supposition to those who bear in mind the
tenacity of tradition among people who have never known books.[328]

#B# 34,

    First dip me in a stand of milk,
      And then in a stand of water;
    Haud me fast, let me na gae,
      I'll be your bairnie's father,

has an occult and very important significance which has only very lately
been pointed out, and which modern reciters had completely lost
knowledge of, as appears by the disorder into which the stanzas have
fallen.[329] Immersion in a liquid, generally water, but sometimes milk,
is a process requisite for passing from a non-human shape, produced by
enchantment, back into the human, and also for returning from the human
to a non-human state, whether produced by enchantment or original. We
have seen that the serpent which Lanzelet kisses, in Ulrich's romance,
is not by that simple though essential act instantly turned into a
woman. It is still necessary that she should bathe in a spring (p. 308).
In an Albanian tale, 'Taubenliebe,' Hahn, No 102, II, 130, a dove flies
into a princess's window, and, receiving her caresses, asks, Do you love
me? The princess answering Yes, the dove says, Then have a dish of milk
ready to-morrow, and you shall see what a handsome man I am. A dish of
milk is ready the next morning; the dove flies into the window, dips
himself in the milk, drops his feathers, and steps out a beautiful
youth. When it is time to go, the youth dips in the milk, and flies off
a dove. This goes on every day for two years. A Greek tale, 'Goldgerte,'
Hahn, No 7, I, 97, has the same transformation, with water for milk. Our
#B# 34 has well-water only.[330] Perhaps the bath of milk occurred in
one earlier version of our ballad, the water-bath in another, and the
two accounts became blended in time.

The end of the mutations, in #F# 11, #G# 43, is a naked man, and a
mother-naked man in #B# 33, under the presumed right arrangement;
meaning by right arrangement, however, not the original arrangement, but
the most consistent one for the actual form of the tradition. Judging by
analogy, the naked man should issue from the bath of milk or of water;
into which he should have gone in one of his non-human shapes, a dove,
swan, or snake (for which, too, a "stand" of milk or of water is a more
practicable bath than for a man). The fragment #C# adds some slight
probability to this supposition. The last change there is into "a dove
but and a swan;" then Tam Lin bids the maiden to let go, for he'll "be a
perfect man:" this, nevertheless, he could not well become without some
further ceremony. #A# is the only version which has preserved an
essentially correct process: Tam Lin, when a burning gleed, is to be
thrown into well-water, from which he will step forth a naked
knight.[331]

At stated periods, which the ballads make to be seven years, the fiend
of hell is entitled to take his teind, tithe, or kane from the people of
fairy-land: #A# 24, #B# 23, #C# 5, #D# 15, #G# 28, #H# 15. The fiend
prefers those that are fair and fu o flesh, according to #A#, #G#; ane o
flesh and blood, #D#. #H# makes the queen fear for herself; "the koors
they hae gane round about, and I fear it will be mysel." #H# is not
discordant with popular tradition elsewhere, which attributes to fairies
the practice of abstracting young children to serve as substitutes for
themselves in this tribute: Scott's Minstrelsy, II, 220, 1802. #D# 15
says "the last here goes to hell," which would certainly not be
equitable, and #C# "we're a' dung down to hell," where "all" must be
meant only of the naturalized members of the community. Poor Alison
Pearson, who lost her life in 1586 for believing these things, testified
that the tribute was annual. Mr William Sympson, who had been taken away
by the fairies, "bidd her sign herself that she be not taken away, for
the teind of them are tane to hell everie year:" Scott, as above, p.
208. The kindly queen of the fairies[332] will not allow Thomas of
Erceldoune to be exposed to this peril, and hurries him back to earth
the day before the fiend comes for his due. Thomas is in peculiar
danger, for the reason given in #A#, #G#, #R#.

    To morne of helle [th]e foulle fende
      Amange this folke will feche his fee;
    And [th]ou art mekill man and hende;
      I trowe full wele he wolde chese the.

The elf-queen, #A# 42, #B# 40, would have taken out Tam's twa gray een,
had she known he was to be borrowed, and have put in twa een of tree,
#B# 41, #D# 34, #E# 21, #H# 14; she would have taken out his heart of
flesh, and have put in, #B#, #D#, #E#, a heart of stane, #H# of tree.
The taking out of the eyes would probably be to deprive Tam of the
faculty of recognizing fairy folk thereafter. Mortals whose eyes have
been touched with fairies' salve can see them when they are to others
invisible, and such persons, upon distinguishing and saluting fairies,
have often had not simply this power but their ordinary eyesight taken
away: see Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p. 304,
Thiele, Danmarks Folkesagn, 1843, II, 202, IV, etc. Grimm has given
instances of witches, Slavic, German, Norse and Italian, taking out the
heart of man (which they are wont to devour), and replacing it in some
instances with straw, wood, or something of the kind; nor do the Roman
witches appear to have been behind later ones in this dealing: Deutsche
Mythologie, 904 f, and the note III, 312.

The fairy in the Lai de Lauval, v. 547, rides on a white palfrey, and
also two damsels, her harbingers, v. 471; so the fairy princess in the
English Launfal, Halliwell, Fairy Mythology, p. 30. The fairy king and
all his knights and ladies ride on white steeds in King Orfeo,
Halliwell, as above, p. 41. The queen of Elfland rides a milk-white
steed in Thomas Rymer, #A#, #C#; in #B#, and all copies of Thomas of
Erceldoune, her palfrey is dapple gray. Tam Lin, #A# 28, #B# 27, etc.,
is distinguished from all the rest of his "court" by being thus mounted;
all the other horses are black or brown.

Tam Lane was taken by the fairies, according to #G# 26, 27, while
sleeping under an apple-tree. In Sir Orfeo (ed. Zielke, v. 68) it was
the queen's sleeping under an ympe-tree that led to her being carried
off by the fairy king, and the ympe-tree we may suppose to be some kind
of fruit tree, if not exclusively the apple. Thomas of Erceldoune is
lying under a semely [derne, cumly] tree, when he sees the fairy queen.
The derivation of that poem from Ogier le Danois shows that this must
have been an apple-tree. Special trees are considered in Greece
dangerous to lie under in summer and at noon, as exposing one to be
taken by the nereids or fairies, especially plane, poplar, fig, nut, and
St John's bread: Schmidt, Volksleben der Neugriechen, p. 119. The elder
and the linden are favorites of the elves in Denmark.

The rencounter at the beginning between Tam Lin and Janet (in the wood,
#D#, #F#, #G#) is repeated between Hind Etin [Young Akin] and Margaret
in 'Hind Etin,' further on. Some Slavic ballads open in a similar way,
but there is nothing noteworthy in that: see p. 41. "First they did call
me Jack," etc., #D# 9, is a commonplace of frequent occurrence: see,
e.g., 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter.'

Some humorous verses, excellent in their way, about one Tam o Lin are
very well known: as Tam o the Linn, Chambers, Scottish Songs, p. 455,
Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 33, ed. 1870; Sharpe's Ballads, new ed.,
p. 44, p. 137, No XVI; Tommy Linn, North Country Chorister, ed. Ritson,
p. 3; Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, p. 271, ed. 1849;
Thomas o Linn, Kinloch MSS, III, 45, V, 81; Tam o Lin, Campbell MSS.,
II, 107. (Miss Joanna Baillie tried her hand at an imitation, but the
jocosity of the real thing is not feminine.) A fool sings this stanza
from such a song in Wager's comedy, 'The longer thou livest, the more
fool thou art,' put at about 1568; see Furnivall, Captain Cox, his
Ballads and Books, p. cxxvii:

    Tom a Lin and his wife, and his wiues mother,
    They went ouer a bridge all three together;
    The bridge was broken, and they fell in:
    'The deuil go with all!' quoth Tom a Lin.

Mr Halliwell-Phillips (as above) says that "an immense variety of songs
and catches relating to Tommy Linn are known throughout the country."
Brian o Lynn seems to be popular in Ireland: Lover's Legends and Stories
of Ireland, p. 260 f. There is no connection between the song and the
ballad beyond the name: the song is no parody, no burlesque, of the
ballad, as it has been called.

"Carterhaugh is a plain at the confluence of the Ettrick with the
Yarrow, scarcely an English mile above the town of Selkirk, and on this
plain they show two or three rings on the ground, where, they say, the
stands of milk and water stood, and upon which grass never grows."

    Gloomy, gloomy was the night,

      And young Tam Lin did win;
    Syne coverd him wi her green mantle,
      As blythe's a bird in spring.

    40
    Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
      Out of a bush o broom:
    'Them that has gotten young Tam Lin
      Has gotten a stately groom.'

    41
    Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
      And an angry woman was she:
    'Shame betide her ill-far'd face,

    For she's taen awa the boniest knight
      In a' my companie.

    O all you ladies young and gay,
      Who are so sweet and fair,
    Do not go into Chaster's wood,
      For Tomlin will be there.

    2
    Fair Margret sat in her bonny bower,
      Sewing her silken seam,
    And wished to be in Chaster's wood,
      Among the leaves so green.

    3
    She let her seam fall to her foot,
      The needle to her toe,
    And she has gone to Chaster's wood,
      As fast as she could go.

    4
    When she began to pull the flowers,
      She pulld both red and green;
    Then by did come, and by did go,
      Said, Fair maid, let aleene.

    5
    'O why pluck you the flowers, lady,
      Or why climb you the tree?
    Or why come ye to Chaster's wood
      Without the leave of me?'

    6
    'O I will pull the flowers,' she said,
      'Or I will break the tree,
    For Chaster's wood it is my own,
      I'll no ask leave at thee.'

    7
    He took her by the milk-white hand,
      And by the grass green sleeve,
    And laid her low down on the flowers,
      At her he asked no leave.

    8
    The lady blushed, and sourly frowned,
      And she did think great shame;
    Says, 'If you are a gentleman,
      You will tell me your name.'

    9
    'First they did call me Jack,' he said,
      'And then they called me John,
    But since I lived in the fairy court
      Tomlin has always been my name.

    10
    'So do not pluck that flower, lady,
      That has these pimples gray;
    They would destroy the bonny babe
      That we've got in our play.'

    11
    'O tell me, Tomlin,' she said,
      'And tell it to me soon,
    Was you ever at good church-door,
      Or got you christendoom?'

    12
    'O I have been at good church-door,
      And aff her yetts within;
    I was the Laird of Foulis's son,
      The heir of all this land.

    13
    'But it fell once upon a day,
      As hunting I did ride,
    As I rode east and west yon hill
      There woe did me betide.

    14
    'O drowsy, drowsy as I was!
      Dead sleep upon me fell;
    The Queen of Fairies she was there,
      And took me to hersell.

    15
    'The Elfins is a pretty place,
      In which I love to dwell,
    But yet at every seven years' end
      The last here goes to hell;
    And as I am ane o flesh and blood,
      I fear the next be mysell.

    'The morn at even is Halloween;
      Our fairy court will ride,
    Throw England and Scotland both,

    The next court that comes along,
      Salute them reverently.

    19

      For in it rides the queen.

      With a gold star in my crown;
    Because I am an earthly man
      I'm next to the queen in renown.

    21
    'Then seize upon me with a spring,
      Then to the ground I'll fa,
    And then you'll hear a rueful cry
      That Tomlin is awa.

    22
    'Then I'll grow in your arms two
      Like to a savage wild;
    But hold me fast, let me not go,
      I'm father of your child.

      Like iron in strong fire;

    25
    She rid down to Miles Cross,
      Between twelve hours and one,
    Took holy water in her hand,
      And cast a compass round.

    26
    The first court that came along,
      She let them all pass by;
    The next court that came along
      Saluted reverently.

    27
    The next court that came along
      Were clad in robes of green,
    When Tomlin, on a milk-white steed,
      She saw ride with the queen.

    28
    She seized him in her arms two,
      He to the ground did fa,
    And then she heard a ruefull cry
      'Tomlin is now awa.'

    29
    He grew into her arms two
      Like to a savage wild;
    She held him fast, let him not go,
      The father of her child.

    30
    He grew into her arms two
      Like an adder or a snake;
    She held him fast, let him not go,
      He was her earthly maick.

    31
    He grew into her arms two
      Like iron in hot fire;
    She held him fast, let him not go,
      He was her heart's desire.

    32
    Then sounded out throw elphin court,
      With a loud shout and a cry,
    That the pretty maid of Chaster's wood
      That day had caught her prey.

    33
    'O stay, Tomlin,' cried Elphin Queen,
      'Till I pay you your fee;'
    'His father has lands and rents enough,
      He wants no fee from thee.'

    34
    'O had I known at early morn
      Tomlin would from me gone,
    I would have taken out his heart of flesh
      Put in a heart of stone.'

    Janet has kilted her green kirtle

    Out then spak her father dear,
      And he spak meik and mild:
    'And ever, alas! my sweet Janet,

      She gaed beside the well,
    And there she saw the steed standing,

    24
    She hadna pu'd a double rose,

    And a' to kill the bonny babe
      That we got us between?

    26
    'The truth ye'll tell to me, Tamlane,

    38
    'For I ride on the milk-white steed,

    'They'll turn me in your arms, Janet,

    46
    Gloomy, gloomy, was the night,
      And eiry was the way,
    As fair Janet, in her green mantle,
      To Miles Cross she did gae.

    47
    About the dead hour o the night
      She heard the bridles ring,
    And Janet was as glad o that
      As any earthly thing.

    48
    And first gaed by the black black steed,
      And then gaed by the brown;
    But fast she gript the milk-white steed,
      And pu'd the rider down.

    49
    She pu'd him frae the milk-white steed,
      And loot the bridle fa,
    And up there raise an erlish cry,
      'He's won amang us a'!'

    50
    They shaped him in fair Janet's arms
      An esk but and an adder;
    She held him fast in every shape,
      To be her bairn's father.

    51
    They shaped him in her arms at last
      A mother-naked man,
    She wrapt him in her green mantle,
      And sae her true love wan.

    52
    Up then spake the Queen o Fairies,
      Out o a bush o broom:
    'She that has borrowd young Tamlane
      Has gotten a stately groom.'

          The heavens were black, the night was dark,

            Her lover to embrace.

          53
          Betwixt the hours of twelve and one
            A north wind tore the bent,

            And bog-reed, struck the ear;
          But solemn sounds, or sober thoughts,
            The fairies cannot bear.

          56
          They sing, inspired with love and joy,
            Like skylarks in the air;
          Of solid sense, or thought that's grave,
            You'll find no traces there.

          57
          Fair Janet stood, with mind unmoved,
            The dreary heath upon,
          And louder, louder waxd the sound
            As they came riding on.

   #b# _6-12 is a fragment of '~The Broomfield-Hill~,'
        introduced by a stanza formed on the sixth, as here
        given:_

          5.
          And she's away to Carterhaugh,
            And gaed beside the wood,
          And there was sleeping young Tamlane,
            And his steed beside him stood.

        _After the fragment of '~The Broomfield-Hill~' follows:_

          13.
          Fair Janet, in her green cleiding,
            Returned upon the morn,
          And she met her father's ae brother,
            The laird of Abercorn.

        _And then these two stanzas, the first altered from Herd's
        fragment of '~The Broomfield Hill~,' '~I'll wager, I'll
        wager~,' p. 310, ed. 1769, and the second from Herd's
        fragment, '~Kertonha~,' or version #C# of this ballad:_

          14.
          I'll wager, I'll wager, I'll wager wi you
            Five hunder merk and ten,
          I'll maiden gang to Carterhaugh,
            And maiden come again.

          15.
          She princked hersell, and prin'd hersell,
            By the ae light of the moon,
          And she's away to Carterhaugh
            As fast as she could win.

          He's taen her by the milk-white hand,
            And by the grass-green sleeve,

[323] These are the concluding verses, coming much nearer to the
language of this world than the rest. They may have a basis of
tradition:

    Whar they war aware o the Fairy King,
      A huntan wi his train.

    Four an twenty gentlemen
      Cam by on steeds o brown;
    In his hand ilk bore a siller wand,
      On his head a siller crown.

    Four an twenty beltit knichts
      On duiplit greys cam by;
    Gowden their wands an crowns, whilk scanct
      Like streamers in the sky.

    Four an twenty noble kings
      Cam by on steeds o snaw,
    But True Thomas, the gude Rhymer,
      Was king outower them a'.

[326] Restoration from enchantment is effected by drinking blood, in

II, 158, by a maid in falcon shape eating of a bit of flesh which her
lover had cut from his breast.

[327] Volksleben der Neugriechen, pp 115-17, "from Chourmouzis, [Gk:
Kr[^e]tika], p. 69 f, Athens, 1842." Chourmouzis heard this story, about
1820 or 1830, from an old Cretan peasant, who had heard it from his
grandfather.

[328] The silence of the Cretan fairy, as #B#. Schmidt has remarked,
even seems to explain Sophocles calling the nuptials of Peleus and
Thetis "speechless," [Gk: aphthongous gamous]. Sophocles gives the
transformations as being lion, snake, fire, water: Scholia in Pindari
Nemea, III, 60; Schmidt, as before, p. 116, note. That a firm grip and a
fearless one would make any sea-god do your will would appear from the
additional instances of Menelaus and Proteus, in Odyssey, IV, and of
Hercules and Nereus, Apollodorus, II, 5, 11, 4, Scholia in Apollonii
Argonaut., IV, 1396. Proteus masks as lion, snake, panther, boar,
running water, tree; Nereus as water, fire, or, as Apollodorus says, in
all sorts of shapes. Bacchus was accustomed to transform himself when
violence was done him, but it is not recorded that he was ever brought
to terms like the watery divinities. See Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldkulte,
II, 60-64, who also well remarks that the tales of the White Ladies,
who, to be released from a ban, must be kissed three times in various
shapes, as toad, wolf, snake, etc., have relation to these Greek
traditions.

[329] The significance of the immersion in water is shown by Mannhardt,
Wald-u. Feldkulte, II, 64 ff. The disorder in the stanzas of #A# at this
place has of course been rectified. In Scott's version, #I#,
transformations are added at random from #C#, _after_ the dipping in
milk and in water, which seems indeed to have been regarded by the
reciters only as a measure for cooling red-hot iron or the burning
gleed, and not as the act essential for restoration to the human nature.

[330] Possibly the holy water in #D# 17, #G# 32, is a relic of the
water-bath.

[331] In the MS. of #B# also the transformation into a het gad of iron
comes just before the direction to dip the object into a stand of milk;
but we have the turning into a mother-naked man several stanzas earlier.
By reading, in 33^1, I'll turn, and putting 33 after 34, we should have
the order of events which we find in #A#.

That Tam Lin should go into water or milk as a dove or snake, or in some
other of his temporary forms, and _come out_ a man, is the only
disposition which is consistent with the order of the world to which he
belongs. Mannhardt gives us a most curious and interesting insight into
some of the laws of that world in Wald-u. Feldkulte, II, 64-70. The wife
of a Cashmere king, in a story there cited from Benfey's Pantschatantra,
I, 254, [S] 92, is delivered of a serpent, but is reported to have borne a
son. Another king offers his daughter in marriage, and the Cashmere
king, to keep his secret, accepts the proposal. In due time the princess
claims her bridegroom, and they give her the snake. Though greatly
distressed, she accepts her lot, and takes the snake about to the holy
places, at the last of which she receives a command to put the snake
into the water-tank. As soon as this is done the snake takes the form of
a man. A woman's giving birth to a snake was by no means a rare thing in
Karst in the seventeenth century, and it was the rule in one noble
family that all the offspring should be in serpent form, or at least
have a serpent's head; but a bath in water turned them into human shape.
For elves and water nymphs who have entered into connections with men in
the form of women, bathing in water is equally necessary for resuming
their previous shape, as appears from an ancient version of the story of
Melusina: Gervasius, ed. Liebrecht, p. 4 f, and Vincentius
Bellovacensis, Speculum Naturale, 2, 127 (from Helinaudus), cited by
Liebrecht, at p. 66.

A lad who had been changed into an ass by a couple of witches recovers
his shape merely by jumping into water and rolling about in it: William
of Malmesbury's Kings of England, c. 10, cited by Vincent of Beauvais,
Speculum Naturale, iii, 109; D[:u]ntzer, Liebrecht's Dunlop, p. 538. Simple
illusions of magic, such as clods and wisps made to appear swine to our
eyes, are inevitably dissolved when the unrealities touch water.

THE QUEEN OF ELFAN'S NOURICE

        Skene MSS, No 8, p. 25. Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. Laing,
        p. 169.


We see from this pretty fragment, which, after the nature of the best
popular ballad, forces you to chant and will not be read, that a woman
had been carried off, four days after bearing a son, to serve as nurse
in the elf-queen's family. She is promised that she shall be permitted
to return home if she will tend the fairy's bairn till he has got the
use of his legs. We could well have spared stanzas 10-12, which belong
to 'Thomas Rymer,' to know a little more of the proper story.

That elves and water-spirits have frequently solicited the help of
mortal women at lying-in time is well known: see Stewart's Popular
Superstitions of the Highlands, p. 104; Grimm, Deutsche Sagen, Nos 41,
49, 68, 69, 304; M[:u]llenhoff, Nos 443, 444; Thiele, Danmarks Folkesagen,
1843, II, 200, Nos 1-4; Asbj[/o]rnsen, Norske Huldre-Eventyr, 2d ed., I,
16; Maurer, Isl[:a]ndische Volkssagen, p. 6 f; Keightley's Fairy Mythology,
pp 122, 261, 275, 301, 311, 388, 488.[333] They also like to have their
offspring suckled by earthly women. It is said, writes Gervase of
Tilbury, that nobody is more exposed to being carried off by
water-sprites than a woman in milk, and that they sometimes restore
such a woman, with pay for her services, after she has nursed their
wretched fry seven years. He had himself seen a woman who had been
abducted for this purpose, while washing clothes on the bank of the
Rhone. She had to nurse the nix's son under the water for that term, and
then was sent back unhurt. Otia Imperialia, III, 85, Liebrecht, p. 38.
Choice is naturally made of the healthiest and handsomest mothers for
this office. "A fine young woman of Nithsdale, when first made a mother,
was sitting singing and rocking her child, when a pretty lady came into
her cottage, covered with a fairy mantle. She carried a beautiful child
in her arms, swaddled in green silk. 'Gie my bonnie thing a suck,' said
the fairy. The young woman, conscious to whom the child belonged, took
it kindly in her arms, and laid it to her breast. The lady instantly
disappeared, saying, 'Nurse kin', an ne'er want.' The young mother
nurtured the two babes, and was astonished, whenever she awoke, at
finding the richest suits of apparel for both children, with meat of
most delicious flavor. This food tasted, says tradition, like loaf mixed
with wine and honey," etc. Cromek, Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway
Song, p. 302.

[333] Many of these instances are cited by Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie,
1875, I, 378. In Thiele's first example the necessity of having
Christian aid comes from the lying-in woman being a Christian who had
been carried off by an elf. In Asbj[/o]rnsen's tale, the woman who is sent
for to act as midwife finds that her own serving-maid is forced, without
being aware of it, to work all night in the elfin establishment, and is
very tired with double duty.

HIND ETIN

It is scarcely necessary to remark that this ballad, like too many
others, has suffered severely by the accidents of tradition. #A# has
been not simply damaged by passing through low mouths, but has been
worked over by low hands. Something considerable has been lost from the
story, and fine romantic features, preserved in Norse and German
ballads, have been quite effaced.

Margaret, a king's daughter, #A#, an earl's daughter, #B#, a lady of
noble birth, #C#, as she sits sewing in her bower door, hears a note in
Elmond's wood and wishes herself there, #A#. The wood is Amon-shaw in
#C#, Mulberry in #B#: the Elmond (Amond, Elfman?) is probably
significant. So far the heroine resembles Lady Isabel in No 4, who,
sewing in her bower, hears an elf-horn, and cannot resist the enchanted
tone. Margaret makes for the wood as fast as she can go. The note that
is heard in #A# is mistaken in #B# for _nuts_: Margaret, as she stands
in her bower door, spies some nuts growing in the wood, and wishes
herself there. Arrived at the wood, Margaret, in #A# as well as #B#,
immediately takes to pulling nuts.[334] The lady is carried off in #C#
under cover of a magical mist, and the hero in all is no ordinary hind.

Margaret has hardly pulled a nut, when she is confronted by young Akin,
#A#, otherwise, and correctly, called Etin in #B#, a hind of giant
strength in both, who accuses her of trespassing, and stops her. Akin
pulls up the highest tree in the wood and builds a bower, invisible to
passers-by, for their habitation. #B#, which recognizes no influence of
enchantment upon the lady's will, as found in #A#, and no prepossession
on her part, as in #C#, makes Hind Etin pull up the biggest tree in the
forest as well, but it is to scoop out a cave many fathoms deep, in
which he confines Margaret till she comes to terms, and consents to _go
home_ with him, wherever that may be. Hastings, another corruption of
Etin, carries off the lady on his horse to the wood, "where again their
loves are sworn," and there they take up their abode in a cave of stone,
#C# 9. Lady Margaret lives with the etin seven years, and bears him
seven sons, #A# 9; many years, and bears seven sons, #B#; ten years, and
bears seven bairns, #C# 6, 8, 9.[335]

Once upon a time the etin goes hunting, and takes his eldest boy with
him. The boy asks his father why his mother is so often in tears, and
the father says it is because she was born of high degree, but had been
stolen by him; "is wife of Hynde Etin, wha ne'er got christendame," #B#
15. The etin, who could pull the highest tree in the wood up by the
roots, adds in #A# 15 that when he stole his wife he was her father's
cup-bearer! and that he caught her "on a misty night," which reminds us
of the mist which Young Hastings, "the groom," cast before the lady's
attendants when he carried her off.

The next time Akin goes hunting he leaves his young comrade behind, and
the boy tells his mother that he heard "fine music ring" when he was
coming home, on the other occasion. She wishes she had been there. He
takes his mother and six brothers, and they make their way through the
wood at their best speed, not knowing in what direction they are going.
But luckily they come to the gate of the king, the father and
grandfather of the band. The mother sends her eldest boy in with three
rings, to propitiate the porter, the butler-boy, who acts as usher in
this particular palace, and the minstrel who plays before the king. His
majesty is so struck with the resemblance of the boy to his daughter
that he is blinded with tears. The boy informs his grandfather that his
mother is standing at the gates, with six more brothers, and the king
orders that she be admitted. He asks her to dine, but she can touch
nothing till she has seen her mother and sister. Admitted to her mother,
the queen in turn says, You will dine with me; but she can touch nothing
till she has seen her sister. Her sister, again, invites her to dine,
but now she can touch nothing till she has seen her "dear husband."
Rangers are sent into the wood to fetch Young Akin, under promise of a
full pardon. He is found tearing his yellow hair. The king now asks Akin
to dine with him, and there appears to have been a family dinner. While
this is going on the boy expresses a wish to be christened, "to get
christendoun;" in all his eight years he had never been in a church. The
king promises that he shall go that very day with his mother, and all
seven of the boys seem to have got their christendoun; and so, we may
hope, did Hind Etin, who was, if possible, more in want of it than they;
#B# 15, 19.

In this story #A# and #B# pretty nearly agree. #C# has nothing of the
restoration of the lady to her parents and home. The mother, in this
version, having harped her seven bairns asleep, sits down and weeps
bitterly. She wishes, like Fair Annie, that they were rats, and she a
cat, to eat them one and all. She has lived ten years in a stone cave,
and has never had a churching. The eldest boy suggests that they shall
all go to some church: they be christened and she be churched. This is
accomplished without any difficulty, and, as the tale stands, we can
only wonder that it had not been attempted before.

The etin of the Scottish story is in Norse and German a dwarf-king,
elf-king, hill-king, or even a merman. The ballad is still sung in
Scandinavia and Germany, but only the Danes have versions taken down
before the present century.

Danish #A#, one of the three sixteenth-century versions, tells how a
knight, expressing a strong desire to obtain a king's daughter, is
overheard by a dwarf, who says this shall never be. The dwarf pretends
to bargain with the knight for his services in forwarding the knight's
object, but consults meanwhile with his mother how he may get the lady
for himself.[338] The mother tells him that the princess will go to
even-song, and the dwarf writes runes on the way she must go by, which
compel her to come to the hill. The dwarf holds out his hand and asks,
How came ye to this strange land? to which the lady answers mournfully,
I wot never how. The dwarf says, You have pledged yourself to a knight,
and he has betrayed you with runes: this eve you shall be the dwarf's
guest. She stayed there the night, and was taken back to her mother in
the morning. Eight years went by; her hand was sought by five kings,
nine counts, but no one of them could get a good answer. One day her
mother asked, Why are thy cheeks so faded? Why can no one get thee? She
then revealed that she had been beguiled by the dwarf, and had seven
sons and a daughter in the hill, none of whom she ever saw. She thought
she was alone, but the dwarf-king was listening. He strikes her with an
elf-rod, and bids her hie to the hill after him. Late in the evening the
poor thing dons her cloak, knocks at her father's door, and says
good-night to the friends that never will see her again, then sadly
turns to the hill. Her seven sons advance to meet her, and ask why she
told of their father. Her tears run sore; she gives no answer; she is
dead ere midnight.

With #A# agrees another of the three old Danish copies, #B#, and three
modern ones, #D#, #M#, #N#, have something of the opening scene which
characterizes #A#. So also Swedish #C#, #I#, and the Icelandic ballad.
In Swedish #C#, Proud Margaret, who is daughter of a king of seven
kingdoms, will have none of her suitors (this circumstance comes too
soon). A hill-king asks his mother how he may get her. She asks in
return, What will you give me to make her come of herself to the hill?
He promises red gold and chestfuls of pence; and one Sunday morning
Margaret, who has set out to go to church, is made--by magical
operations, of course--to take the way to the hill.

A second form begins a stage later: Danish #C#, #G#, #K#, Swedish #D#,
#E#, #K#, Norwegian #A#, #C#, #E#, #G#, #H#, #I# (?), #K#, #L#, #M#
(?), #N# (?), F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#. We learn nothing of the device by
which the maid has been entrapped. Mother and daughter are sitting in
their bower, and the mother asks her child why her cheeks are pale, why
milk is running from her breasts. She answers that she has been working
too hard; that what is taken for milk is mead. The mother retorts that
other women do not suffer from their industry; that mead is brown, and
milk is white. Hereupon the daughter reveals that she has been beguiled
by an elf, and, though living under her mother's roof, has had eight or
nine children (seven or eight sons and a daughter; fifteen children,
F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#), none of whom she ever saw, since after birth
they were always transferred to the hill (see, especially, Danish #C#,
#G#, also #A#; Norwegian #H#, #I#; F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#). The mother
(who disowns her, Danish #C#, #G#, Swedish #D#, #E#, Norwegian #K#), in
several versions, asks what gifts she got for her honor. Among these
was a harp [horn, Norwegian #L#], which she was to play when she was
unhappy. The mother asks for a piece, and the first tones bring the
elf, who reproaches the daughter for betraying him: had she concealed
their connection she might still have lived at home, #C#; but now she
must go with him. She is kindly received by her children. They give her
a drink which makes her forget father and mother, heaven and earth,
moon and sun, and even makes her think she was born in the hill, Danish
#C#, #G#, Swedish #D#, Norwegian #A#, #C#.[339]

Danish #G#, #K#, F[:a]r[:o]e #A#, #B#, take a tragic turn: the woman
dies in the first two the night she comes to the hill. Danish #C#, one
of the sixteenth-century versions, goes as far as possible in the other
direction. The elf-king pats Maldfred's cheek, takes her in his arms,
gives her a queen's crown and name.

    And this he did for the lily-wand,
    He had himself christened and all his land!

A third series of versions offers the probable type of the
much-corrupted Scottish ballads, and under this head come Danish #E#,
#F#, #H#, #I#, #L-R#, #T#; Swedish #A#, #B#, #F-I#, and also #C#, after
an introduction which belongs to the first class; Norwegian #D#, #F#.
The characteristic feature is that the woman has been living eight or
nine years in the hill, and has there borne her children, commonly seven
sons and a daughter. She sets out to go to matins, and whether under the
influence of runes, or accidentally, or purposely, takes the way to the
hill. In a few cases it is clear that she does not seek the hill-man or
put herself in his way, e.g., Danish #N#, Swedish #G#, but Swedish #A#,
#H#, #N# make her apply for admission at the hill-door. In Danish #I#,
#N-R#, #T#, Norwegian #F#, it is not said that she was on her way to
church; she is in a field or in the hill. In Swedish #F# she has been
two years in the cave, and it seems to her as if she had come yesterday.
After her eight or nine years with the hill-man the woman longs to go
home, Danish #E#, #F#, #I#, Swedish #A#, #F#, #I#, Norwegian #D#; to go
to church, Danish #L#, #M#, #N#, #P#, #T#, Norwegian #F#; for she had
heard Denmark's bells, church bells, Danish #L-P#, #T#, Swedish #G#,
Norwegian #D#, #F#. She had heard these bells as she watched the
cradle, Danish #T#, #P#, Swedish #G#; sat by the cradle and sang, #T# 4;
compare English #C# 7. She asks the hill-man's permission, and it is
granted on certain terms: she is not to talk of him and her life in the
hill, Danish #E#, #I#, Swedish #A#, #F#, #I#, is to come back, Danish
#F#, must not stay longer than an hour or two, Norwegian #D#; she is not
to wear her gold, her best clothes, not to let out her hair, not to go
into her mother's pew at the church, not to bow when the priest
pronounces the holy name, or make an offering, or go home after service,
etc., Danish #I#, #L-P#, #T#, Norwegian #F#. All these last conditions
she violates, nor does she in the least heed the injunction not to speak
of the hill-man. The consequence is that he summarily presents himself,
whether at the church or the paternal mansion, and orders her back to
the hill, sometimes striking her on the ear or cheek so that blood runs,
or beating her with a rod, Danish #E#, #I#, #L#, #M#, #S#, #T#, Swedish
#A#, #B#, #C#, #H#, #I#, Norwegian #F#. In a few versions, the hill-man
tells her that her children are crying for her, and she replies, Let
them cry; I will never go back to the hill; Danish #M#, #N#, #O#,
Norwegian #F#. In Danish #E#, Swedish #G#, a gold apple thrown into her
lap seems to compel her to return; more commonly main force is used. She
is carried dead into the hill, or dies immediately on her arrival, in
Norwegian #F#, Danish #T#; she dies of grief, according to traditional
comment, in Norwegian #D#. They give her a drink, and her heart breaks,
Swedish #A#, #G#, #H#, #M#; but elsewhere the drink only induces
forgetfulness, Danish #L#, #M#, Swedish #B#, #C#, #F#.

Much of the story of 'Jomfruen og Dv[ae]rgekongen' recurs in the ballad of
'Agnete og Havmanden,' which, for our purposes, may be treated as a
simple variation of the other. The Norse forms are again numerous, but
all from broadsides dating, at most, a century back, or from recent
tradition.

#Danish.# 'Agnete og Havmanden,' Grundtvig, No 38, #A-D#, II, 51 ff, 656
ff, III, 813 ff. Copies of #A# are numerous, and two had been previously

#Norwegian.# #A#, Grundtvig, III, 817, properly Danish rather than
Norwegian. #B#, a version partly described at p. 818. #C#, Grundtvig,
IV, 809, also more Danish than Norwegian. All these communicated by
Bugge.

Danish #C#, #G#, Norwegian #A#, have a hillman instead of a merman, and
might as well have been put with the other ballad. On the other hand,
the Danish versions #M#, #N#, #O# of 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King' call
the maid Agenet, and give the hill-man a name, Nek, Netmand, Mekmand,
which implies a watery origin for him, and the fragments #P#, #Q#, #R#
have similar names, Nekmand, Negen, L[ae]kkemand, as also Agenete, and
might as well have been ranked with 'Agnes and the Merman.' In 'The Maid
and the Dwarf-King,' Swedish #L# (one stanza) the maid is taken by "Pel
Elfven" to the sea.

Agnes goes willingly with the merman to the sea-bottom, Danish #A#, #D#,
#E#, #K#, Swedish #A#, #D#, #E#, Norwegian #A#, #C#. She lives there,
according to many versions, eight years, and has seven children. As she
is sitting and singing by the cradle one day, she hears the bells of
England, Danish #A#, #C#, #D#, #E#, #H#, #I#, #K#, Swedish #D# [church
bells, bells, #F#, #G#], Norwegian #A#, #C#. She asks if she may go to
church, go home, and receives permission on the same terms as in the
other ballad. Her mother asks her what gifts she had received, Danish
#A#, #D#, #E#, #H#, #I#, Swedish #E#, #F#, Norwegian #C#. When the
merman comes into the church all the images turn their backs, Danish
#A#, #D#, #K#, Swedish #D#, #F#, #G#, Norwegian #A#, #C#; and, in some
cases, for Agnes, too. He tells her that the children are crying for
her; she refuses to go back, Danish #A#, #C#,# D#, #I#, #K#, Swedish
#D#, #F#, #G# (and apparently #A#, #B#, #C#), Norwegian #C#. In
Norwegian #A# the merman strikes her on the cheek, and she returns; in
Danish #I# she is taken back quietly; in Danish #C# he gives her so sore
an ail that she dies presently; in Danish #H# she is taken away by
force, and poisoned by her children; in Danish #K# the merman says that
if she stays with her mother they must divide the children (five). He
takes two, she two, and each has to take half of the odd one.

The Norse forms of 'Agnes and the Merman' are conceded to have been
derived from Germany: see Grundtvig, IV, 812. Of the #German# ballad,
which is somewhat nearer to the English, the following versions have
been noted:

#A.# 'Die sch[:o]ne Agniese,' Fiedler, Volksreime und Volkslieder in
Anhalt-Dessau, p. 140, No 1==Mittler, No 553. #B.# 'Die sch[:o]ne Agnese,'
Parisius, Deutsche Volkslieder in der Altmark und im Magdeburgischen
gesammelt, p. 29, No 8 B, from nearly the same region as #A#. #C.#
Parisius, p. 28, No 8 A, Pechau on the Elbe. #D.# 'Die sch[:o]ne Angnina,'
Erk's Neue Sammlung, ii, 40, No 26==Mittler, No 552, from the
neighborhood of Magdeburg. #E.# 'Die Sch[:o]ne Agnete,' Erk's Liederhort,
No 16^a, p. 47, Erk's Wunderhorn, IV, 91, from the neighborhood of
Guben. _F._ 'Die sch[:o]ne Dorothea,' Liederhort, No 16^b, p. 48, Gramzow
in der Ukermark. #G.# 'Die sch[:o]ne Hann[)a]le,' Liederhort, No 16, p. 44,
Erk's Wunderhorn, IV, 87, Silesia. #H.# 'Die sch[:o]ne Hannele,' Hoffmann
u. Richter, Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 3, No 1==Mittler, No 551, B[:o]hme,
No 90 A, Breslau. 'Der Wassermann,' Simrock, No 1, is a compounded copy.

A wild merman has become enamored of the King of England's daughter,
#A#, #B#, #C#, #D#. He plates a bridge with gold; she often walks over
the bridge; it sinks with her into the water [the merman drags her down
into the water, #H#]. She stays below seven years, and bears seven sons.
One day [by the cradle, #C#, #G#] she hears the bells of England, #A# 6,
#B#, #C#, #D#, #F# [bells, #E#, #G#, #H#], and longs to go to church.
She expresses this wish to the merman, #C#, #D#, #G#, #H#. The merman
says she must take her seven sons with her, #B#, #C#, #D#; she must come
back, #G#, #H#. She takes her seven sons by the hand, and goes with them
to England, #A# 5, #B# 7; cf. Scottish #C# 13, 14, #A# 22, 50. When she
enters the church everything in it bows, #A#, #B#, #F#. Her parents are
there, #C#, #D#; her father opens the pew, her mother lays a cushion for
her, #G#, #H#. As she goes out of the church, there stands the merman,
#A#, #B#, #E#, #F#. Her parents take her home in #D#, #G#, #H#. They
seat her at the table, and while she is eating, a gold apple falls into
her lap (cf. 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,' Danish #E#, Swedish #G#),
which she begs her mother to throw into the fire; the merman appears,
and asks if she wishes him burnt, #G#, #H#. The merman, when he presents
himself at the church, asks whether the woman will go back with him, or
die where she is, and she prefers death on the spot, #A#, #B#, #E#. In
the other case, he says that if she will not return, the children must
be divided,--three and three, and half of the seventh to each; the
mother prefers the water to this. #D# has a peculiar and not very happy
trait. The merman fastens a chain to his wife's foot before she goes up,
and, having been kept long waiting, draws it in. But the people at the
church have taken off the chain, and he finds nothing at the end of it.
He asks whether she does not wish to live with him; she replies, I will
no longer torment you, or fret myself to death.

The story of Agnes and the Merman occurs in a Wendish ballad, with an
introductory scene found in the beautiful German ballad, 'Wassermanns
Braut:'[341] Haupt und Schmaler, I, 62, No 34. A maid begs that she may
be left to herself for a year, but her father says it is time for her to
be married. She goes to her chamber, weeps and wrings her hands. The
merman comes and asks, Where is my bride? They tell him that she is in
her chamber, weeping and wringing her hands. The merman asks her the
reason, and she answers, They all say that you are the merwoman's son.
He says he will build her a bridge of pure silver and gold, and have her
driven over it with thirty carriages and forty horses; but ere she has
half passed the bridge it goes down to the bottom. She is seven years
below, has seven sons in as many years, and is going with the eighth.
She implores her husband to permit her to go to church in the upper
world, and he consents, with the proviso that she shall not stay for the
benediction. At church she sees her brother and sister, who receive her
kindly. She tells them that she cannot stay till the benediction;[342]
they beg her to come home to dine with them. She does wait till the
benediction; the merman rushes frantically about. As she leaves the
church and is saying good-by to her sister, she meets the merman, who
snatches the youngest child from her (she appears to have all seven with
her), tears it in pieces, strangles the rest, scatters their limbs on
the road, and hangs himself, asking, Does not your heart grieve for your
children? She answers, I grieve for none but the youngest.[343]

A Slovenian ballad has the story with modifications, Achacel and
Korytko, [S,]lov['e]n[s,]ke P['e][s,]mi krajnskiga Nar['o]da, I, 30,[344]
'Povodnji m['o]sh;' given in abstract by Haupt and Schmaler, I, 339, note
to No. 34. Mizika goes to a dance, in spite of her mother's forbidding.
Her mother, in a rage, wishes that the merman may fetch her. A young man
who dances with her whirls her round so furiously that she complains,
but he becomes still more violent. Mizika sees how it is, and exclaims,
The merman has come for me! The merman flies out of the window with her,
and plunges into the water. She bears a son, and asks leave to pay a
visit to her mother; and this is allowed on conditions, one of which is
that she shall not expose herself to a benediction. She does not
conform, and the merman comes and says that her son is crying for her.
She refuses to go with him, and he tears the boy in two, that each may
have a half.

Two or three of the minuter correspondences between the Scottish and the
Norse or German ballads, which have not been referred to, may be
indicated in conclusion. The hillman, in several Norwegian copies, as
#B#, #M#, carries off the lady on horseback, and so Hastings in #C#. In
#A# 34-39, the returned sister, being invited to dine, cannot eat a bit
or drink a drop. So, in 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,' Swedish #G# 15,
16, they set before Agnes dishes four and five, dishes eight and nine,
but she can take nothing:

    Agneta ej smakte en endaste bit.

Young Akin, in #A# 43, is found in the wood, "tearing his yellow hair."
The merman has golden hair in Danish #A# 16, Swedish #D# 2, 19,
Norwegian #A# 17 (nothing very remarkable, certainly), and in Danish #D#
31 wrings his hands and is very unhappy, because Agnes refuses to
return. It is much more important that in one of the Swedish copies of
the merman ballad, Grundtvig, II, 661a, we find a trace of the
'christendom' which is made such an object in the Scottish ballads:

    'Nay,' said the mother, 'now thou art mine,'
    And christened her with water and with wine.

'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,' Danish #E#, is translated by Prior, III,
338; Swedish #A# by Stephens, Foreign Quarterly Review, XXV, 35; Swedish

    Lady Margaret sits in her bower door,
      Sewing at her silken seam;
    She heard a note in Elmond's wood,
      And wishd she there had been.

    2
    She loot the seam fa frae her side,
      And the needle to her tae,
    And she is on to Elmond's wood
      As fast as she coud gae.

    3
    She hadna pu'd a nut, a nut,
      Nor broken a branch but ane,
    Till by it came a young hind chiel,
      Says, Lady, lat alane.

    4
    O why pu ye the nut, the nut,
      Or why brake ye the tree?
    For I am forester o this wood:
      Ye shoud spier leave at me.

    5
    'I'll ask leave at no living man,
      Nor yet will I at thee;
    My father is king oer a' this realm,
      This wood belongs to me.'

    6
    She hadna pu'd a nut, a nut,
      Nor broken a branch but three,
    Till by it came him Young Akin,
      And gard her lat them be.

    7
    The highest tree in Elmond's wood,
      He's pu'd it by the reet,
    And he has built for her a bower,
      Near by a hallow seat.

    8
    He's built a bower, made it secure
      Wi carbuncle and stane;
    Tho travellers were never sae nigh,
      Appearance it had nane.

    9
    He's kept her there in Elmond's wood,
      For six lang years and one,
    Till six pretty sons to him she bear,
      And the seventh she's brought home.

    10
    It fell ance upon a day,
      This guid lord went from home,
    And he is to the hunting gane,
      Took wi him his eldest son.

    11
    And when they were on a guid way,
      Wi slowly pace did walk,
    The boy's heart being something wae,
      He thus began to talk:

    12
    'A question I woud ask, father,
      Gin ye woudna angry be:'
    'Say on, say on, my bonny boy,
      Ye'se nae be quarrelld by me.'

    13
    'I see my mither's cheeks aye weet,
      I never can see them dry;
    And I wonder what aileth my mither,
      To mourn continually.'

    14
    'Your mither was a king's daughter,
      Sprung frae a high degree,
    And she might hae wed some worthy prince,
      Had she nae been stown by me.

    15
    'I was her father's cup-bearer,
      Just at that fatal time;
    I catchd her on a misty night,
      Whan summer was in prime.

    16
    'My luve to her was most sincere,
      Her luve was great for me,
    But when she hardships doth endure,
      Her folly she does see.'

    17
    'I'll shoot the buntin o the bush,
      The linnet o the tree,
    And bring them to my dear mither,
      See if she'll merrier be.'

    18
    It fell upo another day,
      This guid lord he thought lang,
    And he is to the hunting gane,
      Took wi him his dog and gun.

    19
    Wi bow and arrow by his side,
      He's aff, single, alane,
    And left his seven children to stay
      Wi their mither at hame.

    20
    'O I will tell to you, mither,
      Gin ye wadna angry be:'
    'Speak on, speak on, my little wee boy,
      Ye'se nae be quarrelld by me.'

    21
    'As we came frae the hynd-hunting,
      We heard fine music ring:'
    'My blessings on you, my bonny boy,
      I wish I'd been there my lane.'

    22
    He's taen his mither by the hand,
      His six brithers also,
    And they are on thro Elmond's wood,
      As fast as they coud go.

    23
    They wistna weel where they were gaen,
      Wi the stratlins o their feet;
    They wistna weel where they were gaen,
      Till at her father's yate.

    24
    'I hae nae money in my pocket,
      But royal rings hae three;
    I'll gie them you, my little young son,
      And ye'll walk there for me.

    25
    'Ye'll gie the first to the proud porter,
      And he will lat you in;
    Ye'll gie the next to the butler-boy,
      And he will show you ben;

    26
    'Ye'll gie the third to the minstrel
      That plays before the king;
    He'll play success to the bonny boy
      Came thro the wood him lane.'

    27
    He gae the first to the proud porter,
      And he opend an let him in;
    He gae the next to the butler-boy,
      And he has shown him ben;

    28
    He gae the third to the minstrel
      That playd before the king;
    And he playd success to the bonny boy
      Came thro the wood him lane.

    29
    Now when he came before the king,
      Fell low down on his knee;
    The king he turned round about,
      And the saut tear blinded his ee.

    30
    'Win up, win up, my bonny boy,
      Gang frae my companie;
    Ye look sae like my dear daughter,
      My heart will birst in three.'

    31
    'If I look like your dear daughter,
      A wonder it is none;
    If I look like your dear daughter,
      I am her eldest son.'

    32
    'Will ye tell me, ye little wee boy,
      Where may my Margaret be?'
    'She's just now standing at your yates,
      And my six brithers her wi.'

    33
    'O where are all my porter-boys
      That I pay meat and fee,
    To open my yates baith wide and braid?
      Let her come in to me.'

    34
    When she came in before the king,
      Fell low down on her knee;
    'Win up, win up, my daughter dear,
      This day ye'll dine wi me.'

    35
    'Ae bit I canno eat, father,
      Nor ae drop can I drink,
    Till I see my mither and sister dear,
      For lang for them I think.'

    36
    When she came before the queen,
      Fell low down on her knee;
    'Win up, win up, my daughter dear
      This day ye'se dine wi me.'

    37
    'Ae bit I canno eat, mither,
      Nor ae drop can I drink,
    Until I see my dear sister,
      For lang for her I think.'

    38
    When that these two sisters met,
      She haild her courteouslie;
    'Come ben, come ben, my sister dear,
    This day ye'se dine wi me.'

    39
    'Ae bit I canno eat, sister,
      Nor ae drop can I drink,
    Until I see my dear husband,
      For lang for him I think.'

    40
    'O where are all my rangers bold
      That I pay meat and fee,
    To search the forest far an wide,
      And bring Akin to me?'

    41
    Out it speaks the little wee boy:
      Na, na, this maunna be;
    Without ye grant a free pardon,
      I hope ye'll nae him see.

    42
    'O here I grant a free pardon,
      Well seald by my own han;
    Ye may make search for Young Akin,
      As soon as ever you can.'

    43
    They searchd the country wide and braid,
      The forests far and near,
    And found him into Elmond's wood,
      Tearing his yellow hair.

    44
    'Win up, win up now, Young Akin,
      Win up, and boun wi me;
    We're messengers come from the court,
      The king wants you to see.'

    45
    'O lat him take frae me my head,
      Or hang me on a tree;
    For since I've lost my dear lady,
      Life's no pleasure to me.'

    46
    'Your head will nae be touchd, Akin,
      Nor hangd upon a tree;
    Your lady's in her father's court,
      And all he wants is thee.'

    47
    When he came in before the king,
      Fell low down on his knee;
    'Win up, win up now, Young Akin,
      This day ye'se dine wi me.'

    48
    But as they were at dinner set,
      The boy asked a boun:
    'I wish we were in the good church,
      For to get christendoun.

    49
    'We hae lived in guid green wood
      This seven years and ane;
    But a' this time, since eer I mind,
      Was never a church within.'

    50
    'Your asking's nae sae great, my boy,
      But granted it shall be;
    This day to guid church ye shall gang,
      And your mither shall gang you wi.'

    51
    When unto the guid church she came,
      She at the door did stan;
    She was sae sair sunk down wi shame,
      She coudna come farer ben.

    52
    Then out it speaks the parish priest,
      And a sweet smile gae he:
    'Come ben, come ben, my lily flower,
      Present your babes to me.'

    53
    Charles, Vincent, Sam and Dick,
      And likewise James and John;
    They calld the eldest Young Akin,
      Which was his father's name.

    54
    Then they staid in the royal court,
      And livd wi mirth and glee,
    And when her father was deceasd,
      Heir of the crown was she.

    May Margret stood in her bouer door,
      Kaiming doun her yellow hair;
    She spied some nuts growin in the wud,
      And wishd that she was there.

    2
    She has plaited her yellow locks
      A little abune her bree,
    And she has kilted her petticoats
      A little below her knee,
    And she's aff to Mulberry wud,
      As fast as she could gae.

    3
    She had na pu'd a nut, a nut,
      A nut but barely ane,

    4
    'Mulberry wuds are a' my ain;
      My father gied them me,
    To sport and play when I thought lang;
      And they sall na be tane by thee.'

    5
    And ae she pu'd the tither berrie,
      Na thinking o' the skaith,
    And said, To wrang ye, Hynde Etin,
      I wad be unco laith.

    But he has tane her by the yellow locks,
      And tied her till a tree,
    And said, For slichting my commands,
      An ill death sall ye dree.

    7
    He pu'd a tree out o the wud,
      The biggest that was there,
    And he howkit a cave monie fathoms deep,
      And put May Margret there.

    8
    'Now rest ye there, ye saucie may;
      My wuds are free for thee;
    And gif I tak ye to mysell,
      The better ye'll like me.'

    9
    Na rest, na rest May Margret took,
      Sleep she got never nane;
    Her back lay on the cauld, cauld floor,
      Her head upon a stane.

    'O tak me out,' May Margret cried,
      'O tak me hame to thee,
    And I sall be your bounden page
      Until the day I dee.'

    11
    He took her out o the dungeon deep,
      And awa wi him she's gane;

      That's come of a noble kin.'

    2
    Four an twenty fair ladies
      Put on this lady's sheen,
    And as mony young gentlemen
      Did lead her ower the green.

    3
    Yet she preferred before them all
      Him, young Hastings the Groom;

      And away this lady has taen.

    4
    He's taken the lady on him behind,
      Spared neither grass nor corn,
    Till they came to the wood o Amonshaw,
      Where again their loves were sworn.

    5
    And they hae lived in that wood
      Full mony a year and day,
    And were supported from time to time
      By what he made of prey.

    And seven bairns, fair and fine,
      There she has born to him,
    And never was in gude church-door,

    7
    Ance she took harp into her hand,
      And harped them a' asleep,
    Then she sat down at their couch-side,

    Said, Seven bairns hae I born now
      To my lord in the ha;

    And I mysel a great grey cat,
      To eat them ane and a'.

    For ten lang years now I hae lived

    O hold your tongue, my mother dear;

    11
    Take you the youngest in your lap,
      The next youngest by the hand,
    Put all the rest of us you before,
      As you learnt us to gang.

    12
    And go with us unto some kirk--
      You say they are built of stane--
    And let us all be christened,
      And you get gude kirking.

    13
    She took the youngest in her lap,
      The next youngest by the hand,
    Set all the rest of them her before,

    And she has left the wood with them,
      And to the kirk has gane,
    Where the gude priest them christened,
      And gave her gude kirking.

        #C.# _Motherwell's copies exhibit five or six slight
        variations from Buchan._


[334] This reading, _nuts_, may have subsequently made its way into #A#
instead of _rose_, which it would be more ballad-like for Margaret to be
plucking, as the maid does in 'Tam Lin,' where also the passage #A# 3-6,
#B# 2-4 occurs. Grimm suggests a parallel to Tam Lin in the dwarf
Laurin, who does not allow trespassing in his rose-garden: Deutsche
Mythologie, III, 130. But the resemblance seems not material, there
being no woman in the case. The pretence of trespass in Tam Lin and Hind
Etin is a simple commonplace, and we have it in some Slavic forms of No
4, as at p. 41.

[335] #B# is defective in the middle and the end. "The reciter,
unfortunately, could not remember more of the ballad, although the story
was strongly impressed on her memory. She related that the lady, after
having been taken home by Hynde Etin, lived with him many years, and
bore him seven sons, the eldest of whom, after the inquiries at his
parents detailed in the ballad, determines to go in search of the earl,
his grandfather. At his departure his mother instructs him how to
proceed, giving him a ring to bribe the porter at her father's gate, and
a silken vest, wrought by her own hand, to be worn in presence of her
father. The son sets out, and arrives at the castle, where, by bribing
the porter, he gets admission to the earl, who, struck with the
resemblance of the youth to his lost daughter, and the similarity of the
vest to one she had wrought for himself, examines the young man, from
whom he discovers the fate of his daughter. He gladly receives his
grandson, and goes to his daughter's residence, where he meets her and
Hynde Etin, who is pardoned by the earl, through the intercession of his
daughter." Kinloch, Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 226 f.

[336] #B#, Landstad 44 (which has only this in common with the Scottish
ballad, that a hill-man carries a maid to his cave), has much
resemblance at the beginning to 'Kvindemorderen,' Grundtvig, No 183, our
No 4. See Grundtvig's note ** at III, 810. This is only what might be
looked for, since both ballads deal with abductions.

[337] It is not necessary, for purposes of the English ballad, to notice
these mixed forms.

[338] In 'N[/o]kkens Svig,' #C#, Grundtvig, No 39, the merman consults with
his mother, and then, as also in other copies of the ballad, transforms
himself into a knight. See the translation by Prior, III, 269; Jamieson,
Popular Ballads, I, 210; Lewis, Tales of Wonder, I, 60.

[339] The beauty of the Norse ballads should make an Englishman's heart
wring for his loss. They are particularly pretty here, where the
forgetful draught is administered; as Norwegian #C#, #A#:

    Forth came her daughter, as jimp as a wand,
    She dances a dance, with silver can in hand.
    'O where wast thou bred, and where wast thou born?
    And where were thy maiden-garments shorn?'
    'In Norway was I bred, in Norway was I born,
    And in Norway were my maiden-garments shorn.'
    The ae first drink from the silver can she drank,
    What stock she was come of she clean forgat.
    'O where wast thou bred, and where wast thou born?
    And where were thy maiden-garments shorn?'
    'In the hill was I bred, and there was I born,
    In the hill were my maiden-garments shorn.'

[340] For reasons, doubtless sufficient, but to me unknown, Grundtvig
has not noticed two copies in Boisen's Nye og gamle Viser, 10th
edition, p. 192, p. 194. The former of these is like #A#, with more
resemblance here and there to other versions, and may be a made-up
copy; the other, 'Agnete og Bj[ae]rgmanden, fra S[/o]nderjylland,'
consists of stanzas 1-5 of #C#.

[341] See five versions in Mittler, Nos 546-550. As Grundtvig remarks,
what is one ballad in Wendish is two in German and three in Norse: #D#.
g. #F#., IV, 810.

[342] This trait, corresponding to the prohibition in the Norse ballads
of bowing when the holy name is pronounced, occurs frequently in
tradition, as might be expected. In a Swedish merman-ballad, 'Necken,'
Afzelius, III, 133, the nix, who has attended to church the lady
whom he is about to kidnap, makes off with his best speed when the
priest reads the benediction. See, further, ['A]rnason's ['I]slenzkar
[th]j['o][dh]s[:o]gur, I, 73 f; Maurer's Isl[:a]ndische Volksagen, 19
f; Liebrecht, Gervasius, p. 26, LVII, and p. 126, note (Grundtvig).

[343] The merfolk are apt to be ferocious, as compared with hill-people,
elves, etc. See Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, I, 409 f.

[344] I 79, of a second edition, which, says Vraz, has an objectionable
fantastic spelling due to the publisher.

CLERK COLVILL

        #A.# 'Clark Colven,' from a transcript of No 13 of William
        Tytler's Brown MS.

        #B.# 'Clerk Colvill, or, The Mermaid,' Herd's Ancient and
        Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 302.

        #C.# W. F. in Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, VIII, 510,
        from the recitation of a lady in Forfarshire.


Although, as has been already said, William Tytler's Brown manuscript is
now not to be found, a copy of two of its fifteen ballads has been
preserved in the Fraser Tytler family, and 'Clerk Colvill,' #A# ('Clark
Colven') is one of the two.[345] This ballad is not in Jamieson's Brown
manuscript. Rewritten by Lewis, #A# was published in Tales of Wonder,
1801, II, 445, No 56. #B#, 1769, is the earliest printed English copy,
but a corresponding Danish ballad antedates its publication by
seventy-five years. Of #C#, W. F., who communicated it to Notes and
Queries, says: "I have reason to believe that it is originally from the
same source as that from which Scott, and especially Jamieson, derived
many of their best ballads." This source should be no other than Mrs
Brown, who certainly may have known two versions of Clerk Colvill; but
#C# is markedly different from #A#. An Abbotsford manuscript, entitled
"Scottish Songs," has, at fol. 3, a version which appears to have been
made up from Lewis's copy, its original, #A#, and Herd's, #B#.

All the English versions are deplorably imperfect, and #C# is corrupted,
besides. The story which they afford is this. Clerk Colvill, newly
married as we may infer, is solemnly entreated by his gay lady never to
go near a well-fared may who haunts a certain spring or water. It is
clear that before his marriage he had been in the habit of resorting to
this mermaid, as she is afterwards called, and equally clear, from the
impatient answer which he renders his dame, that he means to visit her
again. His coming is hailed with pleasure by the mermaid, who, in the
course of their interview, does something which gives him a strange pain
in the head,--a pain only increased by a prescription which she pretends
will cure it, and, as she then exultingly tells him, sure to grow worse
until he is dead. He draws his sword on her, but she merrily springs
into the water. He mounts his horse, rides home tristful, alights
heavily, and bids his mother make his bed, for all is over with him.

#C# is at the beginning blended with verses which belong to 'Willie and
May Margaret,' Jamieson, I, 135 (from Mrs Brown's recitation), or 'The
Drowned Lovers,' Buchan, I, 140. In this ballad a mother adjures her son
not to go wooing, under pain of her curse. He goes, nevertheless, and is
drowned. It is obvious, without remark, that the band and belt in #C# 1
do not suit the mother; neither does the phrase 'love Colin' in the
second stanza.[346] #C# 9-11 afford an important variation from the
other versions. The mermaid appears at the foot of the young man's bed,
and offers him a choice between dying then and living with her in the
water. (See the Norwegian ballads at p. 377.)

Clerk Colvill is not, as his representative is or may be in other
ballads, the guiltless and guileless object of the love or envy of a
water-sprite or elf. His relations with the mermaid began before his
marriage with his gay lady, and his death is the natural penalty of his
desertion of the water-nymph; for no point is better established than
the fatal consequences of inconstancy in such connections.[347] His
history, were it fully told, would closely resemble that of the Knight
of Staufenberg, as narrated in a German poem of about the year
1300.[348]

The already very distinguished chevalier, Peter Diemringer, of
Staufenberg (in the Ortenau, Baden, four leagues from Strassburg),
when riding to mass one Whitsunday, saw a lady of surpassing beauty,
dressed with equal magnificence, sitting on a rock by the wayside.
He became instantaneously enamored, and, greeting the lady in terms
expressive of his admiration, received no discouraging reply. The lady
rose; the knight sprang from his horse, took a hand which she offered,
helped her from the rock, and they sat down on the grass. The knight
asked how she came to be there alone. The lady replied that she had
been waiting for him: ever since he could bestride a horse she had been
devoted to him; she had been his help and protection in tourneys and
fights, in all climes and regions, though he had never seen her. The
knight wished he might ever be hers. He could have his wish, she said,
and never know trouble or sickness, on one condition, and that was that
he never should marry: if he did this, he would die in three days. He
vowed to be hers as long as he lived; they exchanged kisses, and then
she bade him mount his horse and go to mass. After the benediction he
was to return home, and when he was alone in his chamber, and wished
for her, she would come, and so always; that privilege God had given
her: "sw[^a] ich wil, d[^a] bin ich." They had their meeting when he
returned from church: he redoubled his vows, she promised him all good
things, and the bounties which he received from her overflowed upon all
his friends and comrades.

The knight now undertook a chivalrous tour, to see such parts of the
world as he had not visited before. Wherever he went, the fair lady had
only to be wished for and she was by him: there was no bound to her love
or her gifts. Upon his return he was beset by relatives and friends, and
urged to marry. He put them off with excuses: he was too young to
sacrifice his freedom, and what not. They returned to the charge before
long, and set a wise man of his kindred at him to beg a boon of him.
"Anything," he said, "but marrying: rather cut me into strips than
that." Having silenced his advisers by this reply, he went to his closet
and wished for his lady. She was full of sympathy, and thought it might
make his position a little easier if he should tell his officious
friends something of the real case, how he had a wife who attended him
wherever he went and was the source of all his prosperity; but he must
not let them persuade him, or what she had predicted would surely come
to pass.

At this time a king was to be chosen at Frankfurt, and all the nobility
flocked thither, and among them Staufenberg, with a splendid train. He,
as usual, was first in all tourneys, and made himself remarked for his
liberal gifts and his generous consideration of youthful antagonists:
his praise was in everybody's mouth. The king sent for him, and offered
him an orphan niece of eighteen, with a rich dowry. The knight excused
himself as unworthy of such a match. The king said his niece must accept
such a husband as he pleased to give, and many swore that Staufenberg
was a fool. Bishops, who were there in plenty, asked him if he had a
wife already. Staufenberg availed himself of the leave which had been
given him, and told his whole story, not omitting that he was sure to
die in three days if he married. "Let me see the woman," said one of the
bishops. "She lets nobody see her but me," answered Staufenberg. "Then
it is a devil," said another of the clergy, "and your soul is lost
forever." Staufenberg yielded, and said he would do the king's will. He
was betrothed that very hour, and set out for Ortenau, where he had
appointed the celebration of the nuptials. When night came he wished for
the invisible lady. She appeared, and told him with all gentleness that
he must prepare for the fate of which she had forewarned him, a fate
seemingly inevitable, and not the consequence of her resentment. At the
wedding feast she would display her foot in sight of all the guests:
when he saw that, let him send for the priest. The knight thought of
what the clergy had said, and that this might be a cheat of the devil.
The bride was brought to Staufenberg, the feast was held, but at the
very beginning of it a foot whiter than ivory was seen through the
ceiling. Staufenberg tore his hair and cried, Friends, ye have ruined
yourselves and me! He begged his bride and all who had come with her to
the wedding to stay for his funeral, ordered a bed to be prepared for
him and a priest to be sent for. He asked his brothers to give his bride
all that he had promised her. But she said no; his friends should rather
have all that she had brought; she would have no other husband, and
since she had been the cause of his death she would go into a cloister,
where no eye should see her: which she did after she had returned to her
own country.

A superscription to the old poem denominates Staufenberg's amphibious
consort a mer-fey, sea-fairy; but that description is not to be strictly
interpreted, no more than mer-fey, or fata morgana, is in some other
romantic tales. There is nothing of the water-sprite in her, nor is she
spoken of by any such name in the poem itself. The local legends of
sixty years ago,[349] and perhaps still, make her to have been a proper
water-nymph. She is first met with by the young knight near a spring or
a brook, and it is in a piece of water that he finds his death, and that
on the evening of his wedding day.

Clerk Colvill and the mermaid are represented by Sir Oluf and an elf in
Scandinavian ballads to the number of about seventy. The oldest of these
is derived from a Danish manuscript of 1550, two centuries and a half
later than the Staufenberg poem, but two earlier than Clerk Colvill, the
oldest ballad outside of the Scandinavian series. Five other versions
are of the date 1700, or earlier, the rest from tradition of this
century. No ballad has received more attention from the heroic Danish
editor, whose study of 'Elveskud' presents an admirably ordered synoptic
view of all the versions known up to 1881: Grundtvig, No 47, II, 109-19,
663-66; III, 824-25; IV, 835-74.[350]

Of these the F[:a]r[:o]e versions are nearest to the English. Olaf's mother
asks him whither he means to ride; his corselet is hanging in the loft;
#A#, #C#, #D#. "I am going to the heath, to course the hind," he says.
"You are not going to course the hind; you are going to your leman.
White is your shirt, well is it washed, but bloody shall it be when it
is taken off," #A#, #D#. "God grant it be not as she bodes!" exclaims
Olaf, as he turns from his mother, #A#. He rides to the hills and comes
to an elf-house. An elf comes out, braiding her hair, and invites him to
dance. "You need not braid your hair for me; I have not come a-wooing,"
he says. "I must quit the company of elves, for to-morrow is my bridal."
"If you will have no more to do with elves, a sick bridegroom shall you
be! Would you rather lie seven years in a sick-bed, or go to the mould
to-morrow?" He would rather go to the mould to-morrow. The elf brought
him a drink, with an atter-corn, a poison grain, floating in it: at the
first draught his belt burst #A#, #B*#. "Kiss me," she said, "before you
ride." He leaned over and kissed her, though little mind had he to it:
she was beguiling him, him so sick a man. His mother came out to meet
him: "Why are you so pale, as if you had been in an elf-dance?" "I have
been in an elf-dance," he said,[352] went to bed, turned his face to the
wall, and was dead before midnight. His mother and his love (moy, v['i]v)
died thereupon.

Distinct evidence of previous converse with elves is lacking in the
Icelandic versions. Olaf rides along the cliffs, and comes upon an
elf-house. One elf comes out with her hair twined with gold, another
with a silver tankard, a third in a silver belt, and a fourth welcomes
him by name. "Come into the booth and drink with us." "I will not live
with elves," says Olaf; "rather will I believe in God." The elf answers
that he might do both, excuses herself for a moment, and comes back in a
cloak, which hides a sword. "You shall not go without giving us a kiss,"
she says. Olaf leans over his saddle-bow and kisses her, with but half a
heart, and she thrusts the sword under his shoulder-blade into the roots
of his heart. He sees his heart's blood under his horse's feet, and
spurs home to his mother. "Whence comest thou, my son, and why so pale,
as if thou hadst been in an elf-dance (leik)?" "It boots not to hide it
from thee: an elf has beguiled me. Make my bed, mother; bandage my side,
sister." He dies presently: there was more mourning than mirth; three
were borne to the grave together.

Nearly all the Danish and Swedish versions, and a good number of the
Norwegian, interpose an affecting scene between the death of the hero
and that of his bride and his mother. The bride, on her way to Olaf's
house, and on her arrival, is disconcerted and alarmed by several
ominous proceedings or circumstances. She hears bells tolling; sees
people weeping; sees men come and go, but not the bridegroom. She is put
off for a time with false explanations, but in the end discovers the
awful fact. Such a passage occurs in the oldest Danish copy, which is
also the oldest known copy of the ballad. The importance of this version
is such that the story requires to be given with some detail.

Oluf rode out before dawn, but it seemed to him bright as day.[353] He
rode to a hill where dwarfs were dancing. A maid stepped out from the
dance, put her arm round his neck, and asked him whither he would ride.
"To talk with my true-love," said he. "But first," said she, "you must
dance with us." She then went on to make him great offers if he would
plight himself to her: a horse that would go to Rome and back in an
hour, and a gold saddle for it; a new corselet, having which he never
need fly from man; a sword such, as never was used in war. Such were all
her benches as if gold were laid in links, and such were all her
drawbridges as the gold on his hands. "Keep your gold," he answered; "I
will go home to my true-love." She struck him on the cheek, so that the
blood spattered his coat; she struck him midshoulders, so that he fell
to the ground: "Stand up, Oluf, and ride home; you shall not live more
than a day." He turned his horse, and rode home a shattered man. His
mother was at the gate: "Why comest thou home so sad?" "Dear mother,
take my horse; dear brother, fetch a priest," "Say not so, Oluf; many a
sick man does not die. To whom do you give your betrothed?" "Rise, my
seven brothers, and ride to meet my young bride."

As the bride's train came near the town, they heard the bells going.
"Why is this?" she asked, her heart already heavy with pain; "I know of
no one having been sick." They told her it was a custom there to receive
a bride so. But when she entered the house, all the women were weeping.
"Why are these ladies weeping?" No one durst answer a word. The bride
went on into the hall, and took her place on the bride-bench. "I see,"
she said, "knights go and come, but I see not my lord Oluf." The mother
answered, Oluf is gone to the wood with hawk and hound. "Does he care
more for hawk and hound than for his young bride?"

At evening they lighted the torches as if to conduct the bride to the
bride-bed; but Oluf's page, who followed his lady, revealed the truth on
the way. "My lord," he said, "lies on his bier above, and you are to
give your troth to his brother." "Never shalt thou see that day that I
shall give my troth to two brothers." She begged the ladies that she
might see the dead. They opened the door; she ran to the bier, threw
back the cloth, kissed the body precipitately; her heart broke in
pieces; grievous was it to see.

Danish #B#, printed by Syv in 1695, is the copy by which the ballad of
the Elf-shot has become so extensively known since Herder's time,
through his translation and others.[354]

The principal variations of the Scandinavian ballads, so far as they
have not been given, now remain to be noted.

The hero's name is mostly Oluf, Ole, or a modification of this, Wolle,
Rolig, Volder; sometimes with an appendage, as F[:a]r[:o]e ['O]lavur
Riddarar['o]s, R['o]sinkrans, Icelandic ['O]lafur Liljur['o]s,
Norwegian Olaf Liljukrans, etc. It is Peder in Danish #H#, #I#, #O#,
#P#, #Q#, #R#, #[AE]#.

Excepting the F[:a]r[:o]e ballads, Oluf is not distinctly represented as
having had previous acquaintance with the elves. In Swedish #A# 5 he
says, I cannot dance with you, my betrothed has forbidden me; in Danish
#C#, I should be very glad if I could; to-morrow is my wedding-day.

The object of his riding out is to hunt, or the like, in Danish #D b#,
#E#, #F#, #I#, #R#, #T#, #X#, #Y#; to bid guests to his wedding, Danish
#B#, #C#, #D a#, #G#, #H#, #K-N#, #P#, #S#, #U#, #V#, #[/O]#, Norwegian
#A#, #B#.

He falls in with dwarfs, Danish #A#, #H#, Norwegian _A_; trolds, Danish
#I#; elves and dwarfs, Norwegian #B#, and a variation of #A#: elsewhere
it is elves.

There is naturally some diversity in the gifts which the elf offers Oluf
in order to induce him to dance with her. He more commonly replies that
the offer is a handsome one, 'kan jeg vel f[oa],' but dance with her he
cannot; sometimes that his true-love has already given him that, or two,
three, seven such, Danish #D a#, #I#, #T#, #X#, #Y#.

If he will not dance with her, the elf threatens him with sore sickness,
Danish #B#, #E#, #H#, #Z#, #[/O]#, Norwegian #A#, Swedish #E#, #F#; a great
misfortune, Danish #F#, Swedish #A#; sharp knives, Danish #P#; it shall
cost him his young life, Danish #D a, b#, #T#, #Y#.

Oluf dances with the elves, obviously under compulsion, in Danish #C#,
#D#, #G-N#, #S#, #T#, #U#, #X#, #Y#, Swedish #F#, and only in these. He
dances till both his boots are full of blood, #D a# 15, #D b# 4, #G# 5,
#I# 11, #K# 5, #L# 5, #M# 6, #N# 7, #S# 6 [shoes], #T# 10, #U# 5, #X# 8,
#Y# 7; he dances so long that he is nigh dead, #I# 12.

The hard choice between dying at once or lying sick seven years is
found, out of the F[:a]r[:o]e ballads, only in Danish #H# 8, #M# 8, #O#
4, #Q# 2, #S# 8. Norwegian ballads, like English #C#, present an option
between living with elves and dying, essentially a repetition of the
terms under which Peter of Staufenberg weds the fairy, that he shall
forfeit his life if he takes a mortal wife. So Norwegian

    #A# 12
    Whether wilt thou rather live with the elves,
    Or leave the elves, a sick man?

    13
    Whether wilt thou be with the elves,
    Or bid thy guests and be sick?

    #B# 9
    Whether wilt thou stay with the elves,
    Or, a sick man, flit [bring home] thy true-love?

    10
    Whether wilt thou be with elves,
    Or, a sick man, flit thy bride?

There is no answer.

Norwegian #C#, #E#, #G#, #I# resemble #A#. #H# is more definite.

    6
    Whether wilt thou go off sick, "under isle,"
    Or wilt thou marry an elf-maid?

    7
    Whether wilt thou go off sick, under hill,
    Or wilt thou marry an elf-wife?

To which Olaf answers that he lists not to go off a sick man, and he
cannot marry an elf.

The two last stanzas of English #C#, which correspond to these,

    'Will ye lie there an die, Clerk Colin,
      Will ye lie there an die?
    Or will ye gang to Clyde's water,
      To fish in flood wi me?'

    'I will lie here an die,' he said,
      'I will lie here an die;
    In spite o a' the deils in hell,
      I will lie here an die,'

may originally have come in before the mermaid and the clerk parted; but
her visit to him as he lies in bed is paralleled by that of the fairy to
Staufenberg after he has been persuaded to give up what he had been
brought to regard as an infernal _liaison_; and certainly Clerk Colin's
language might lead us to think that some priest had been with him, too.

Upon Oluf's now seeking to make his escape through the elves' flame,
ring, dance, etc., Norwegian #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, #G#, #I#, #H#, #K#, the
elf-woman strikes at him with a gold band, her wand, hand, a branch or
twig; gives him a blow on the cheek, between the shoulders, over his
white neck; stabs him in the heart, gives him knife-strokes five, nine;
sickness follows the stroke, or blood: Danish #A#, #B#, #F#, #N#, #O#,
#R#, #V#, #Z#, #[AE]#, #[/O]#, Swedish #D#, #G#, Norwegian #A-E#, #H#, #I#,
Icelandic. The knife-stabs are delayed till the elves have put him on
his horse in Danish #D#, #G#, #X#; as he sprang to his horse the knives
rang after him, #H#. "Ride home," they say, "you shall not live more
than a day" [five hours, two hours], Danish #A#, #C#, #K-N#, #S#, #U#,
#V#. His hair fades, Danish #E#; his cheek pales, Danish #E#, Norwegian
#A#; sickness follows him home, Swedish #A#, #C#, #D#, #E#; the blood is
running out of the wound in his heart, Swedish #G#; when he reaches his
father's house both his boots are full of blood, Danish #R#, #[AE]#.

His mother [father] is standing without, and asks, Why so pale? Why runs
the blood from thy saddle? Oluf, in some instances, pretends that his
horse, not being sure-footed, had stumbled, and thrown him against a
tree, but is told, or of himself adds, that he has been among the elves.
He asks one or the other of his family to take his horse, bring a
priest, make his bed, put on a bandage. He says he shall never rise from
his bed, Swedish #C#, Danish #F#; fears he shall not live till the
priest comes, Danish #O#, #P#.

The important passage which relates the arrival of the bride, the
ominous circumstances at the bridegroom's house, the attempts to keep
the bride in ignorance of his death, and her final discovery that she is
widowed before marriage, occupies some thirty stanzas in Danish #A#,
the oldest of all copies; in Danish #B# it is reduced to six; in other
Danish versions it has a range of from fifteen to two; but, shorter or
longer, it is found in all versions but #R#, #[/O]#, and the fragments #G#,
#L#, #Q#, #X#, #Z#. All the Swedish versions have a similar scene,
extending from three to nine stanzas, with the exception of #G# and of
#A#, which latter should perhaps be treated as a fragment. In Norwegian
#A#, again, this part of the story fills ten stanzas; #B# lacks it, but
#C-H# (which have not been published in full) have it, and probably
other unpublished copies.

The bride is expected the next day, Danish #D#, #F#, #I#, #K#, #N#, #O#,
#S#, #T#, #U#, Swedish #A#, #D#. In Danish #A# Oluf begs his brothers,
shortly after his reaching home, to set out to meet her; he fears she
may arrive that very night, Danish #[AE]#. "What shall I answer your young
bride?" asks the mother, Danish #B#, #C#, #D#, etc., Swedish #H#. "Tell
her that I have gone to the wood, to hunt and shoot, to try my horse and
my dogs," Danish #B#, #C#, #D#, #F#, #H#, #I#, #K#, #O#, #S#, #T#, #U#,
Swedish #D#, #H#, Norwegian #A#, #L#; in Danish #N# only, "Say I died in
the night." Oluf now makes his will; he wishes to assign his bride to
his brother, Danish #L#, #O#, #R#, Norwegian #C#, #F#; he dies before
the bride can come to him. (Norwegian #F# seems to have gone wrong
here.)

The bride, with her train, comes in the morning, Danish #B#, #D#, #E#,
#I#, #M#, #T#, Swedish #D#, Norwegian #D#; Swedish #C# makes her wait
for her bridegroom several days. As she passes through the town the
bells are tolling, and she anxiously asks why, Danish #A#, #K#, #O#,
#S#, #U#; she is told that it is a custom there to ring when the bride
comes, Danish #A#, Swedish #B#. In Danish #H#, though it is day, she
sees a light burning in Oluf's chamber, and this alarms her. When she
comes to the house, Oluf's mother is weeping, all the ladies are
weeping, or there are other signs of grief, Danish #A#, #C#, #H#, #U#,
#[AE]#. When she asks the reason, no one can answer, or she is told that a
woman, a fair knight, is dead, #A#, #C#, #H#. Now she asks, Where is
Oluf, who should have come to meet me, should have been here to receive
me? Danish #K#, #O#, #S#, #U#, #D#, #E#, #I#, #T#, etc. They conduct the
bride into the hall and seat her on the bride bench; knights come and
go; they pour out mead and wine. "Where is Oluf," she asks again; the
mother replies, as best she can, that Oluf is gone to the wood, Danish
#B#, #H#, Norwegian #A#, #D#, Swedish #H#, etc. "Does he then care more
for that than for his bride?" Danish #A#, #D#, #I#, #M#, etc., Swedish
#C#, #D#, Norwegian #A#, #E#, #G#.

The truth is now avowed that Oluf is dead, Danish #A#, #D#, #I#, #T#,
#Y#, #[AE]#, Swedish #B#, Norwegian #G#. The bride begs that she may see
the dead, Danish #A#, #C#, #P#, #[AE]#, Swedish #F#, Norwegian #D#, #E#,
and makes her way to the room where Oluf is lying. She puts aside the
cloths that cover him, or the curtains, or the flowers, Danish #A#, #B#,
#K#, #V#, etc., Swedish #C#, #D#, Norwegian #C#, #D#, #E#, #G#; says a
word or two to her lover, Danish #A#, #C#, #E#, #H#, Swedish #E#, #F#,
Norwegian #G#; kisses him, Danish #A#, #C#, #H#; her heart breaks,
Danish #A#, #C#; she swoons dead at his feet, Danish #K#, #M#, #S#, #U#.
In Norwegian #A#, #C#, #D#, she kills herself with Olaf's sword; in
Swedish #E#, with her own knife. In Danish #R# she dies in Oluf's
mother's arms. On the morrow, when it was day, in Oluf's house three
corpses lay: the first was Oluf, the second his maid, the third his
mother, of grief was she dead: Danish, Swedish, Norwegian,
_passim_.[355]

#Breton# ballads preserve the story in a form closely akin to the
Scandinavian, and particularly to the oldest Danish version. I have
seen the following, all from recent tradition: #A#, #C#, 'Ann Aotro ar
C'hont,' 'Le Seigneur Comte,' Luzel, I, 4/5, 16/17, fifty-seven and
fifty-nine two-line stanzas. #B#, 'Ann Aotro Nann,' 'Le Seigneur Nann,'
Luzel, #I#, 10/11, fifty-seven stanzas.[356] #D#, 'Aotrou Nann hag ar
Gorrigan,' 'Le Seigneur Nann et la F['e]e,' Villemarqu['e], p. 25, ed.
1867, thirty-nine stanzas. #E#, 'Monsieur Nann,' Po['e]sies populaires
de la France, MS., V, fol. 381, fifty-three verses. #F#, 'Sonen Gertrud
guet hi Vam,' 'Chant de Gertrude et de sa M[e']re,' L. K['e]rardven
[==Dufilhol], Guionvac'h, ['E]tudes sur la Bretagne, 2d ed., Paris,
1835, p. 362, p. 13, eleven four-line stanzas. #G#, Rolland in Romania,
XII, 117, a somewhat abridged literal translation, in French.

The count [Nann] and his wife were married at the respective ages of
thirteen and twelve. The next year a son was born [a boy and girl, #D#].
The young husband asked the countess if she had a fancy for anything.
She owned that she should like a bit of game, and he took his gun
[lance] and went to the wood. At the entrance of the wood he met a fairy
[a dwarf, #E#; a hind, #G#; saw a white hind, which he pursued hotly
till evening, when he dismounted near a grotto to drink, and there was a
korrigan, sitting by the spring, combing her hair with a gold comb,
#D#]. The fairy [dwarf, hind] said that she had long been looking for
him, #A#, #B#, #C#, #E#, #G#. "Now that I have met you, you must marry
me."[357] "Marry you? Not I. I am married already." "Choose either to
die in three days or to lie sick in bed seven [three] years" [and then
die, #C#]. He would rather die in three days, for his wife is very
young, and would suffer greatly [he would rather die that instant than
wed a korrigan, #D#].

On reaching home the young man called to his mother to make his bed; he
should never get up again. [His mother, in #C# 21, says, Do not weep so:
it is not every sick man that dies, as in Danish #A# 22.] He recounted
his meeting with the fairy, and begged that his wife might not be
informed of his death.

The countess asked, What has happened to my husband, that he does not
come to see me? She was told that he had gone to the wood to get her
something, #A# [to Paris, #C#; to the city, #D#]. Why were the
men-servants weeping? The best horse had been drowned in bathing him,
#A#, #E#; had been eaten by the wolves, #B#; had broken his neck, #C#;
had died, #F#. They were not to weep; others should be bought. And why
were the maids weeping? Linen had been lost in washing, #A#, #C#, #E#,
#F#; the best silver cover had been stolen, #F#. They must not weep; the
loss would be supplied. Why were the priests chanting? [the bells
tolling, #E#, #F#]. A poor person whom they had lodged had died in the
night, #A-E# [a young prince had died, #F#]. What dress should she wear
for her churching,--red or blue? #D#, #F#.[358] The custom had come in
of wearing black [she asks for red, they give her black, #F#]. On
arriving at the church, or cemetery, she saw that the earth had been
disturbed; her pew was hung with black, #B#; why was this? "I can no
longer conceal it," said her mother-in-law: "your husband is dead." She
died upon the spot, #A#, #D#. "Take my keys, take care of my son; I will
stay with his father," #B#, #C#. "Your son is dead, your daughter is
dead," #F#.[359]

This ballad has spread, apparently from Brittany, over all France. No
distinct trace of the fairy remains, however, except in a single case.
The versions that have been made public, so far as they have come to my
knowledge, are as follows, resemblance to the Breton ballad principally
directing the arrangement.

Renaud,' E. Hamy, in Almanach de Boulogne-sur-Mer pour 1863, p. 110

The name of the hero in the French ballad is mostly Renaud, or some
modification of Renaud: Jean Renaud, #G#, #H#, #U#; Renom, #AA#; Arnaud,
#C#, #E#, #L#, #Y#, #BB#; L'Arnaud l'Infant, #P#; Louis Renaud, brother
of Jean, #F#. It is Louis in #A#, #I#, #J#, #V#. He is king, or of the
royal family, #F#, #M#, #N#, #O#, #Q#, #W#, #BB#, #CC#, #GG#; count,
#Y#; Renaud le grand, #H#, #Z#. In #A#, while he is walking in his
meadows, he meets Death, who asks him, peremptorily, Would you rather
die this very night, or languish seven years? and he answers that he
prefers to die at once. Here there is a very plain trace of the older
fairy. He is mortally hurt, while hunting, by a wolf, #B#; by a boar,
#DD#. But in more than twenty versions he returns from war, often with a
horrible wound, "apportant son c[oe]ur dans sa main," #C#; "tenant ses
tripes dans ses mains," #N#; "oque ses tripes on sa main, sen estoumac
on sen chapea, sen c[^u]r covert de sen mentea," #G#; etc. In #F#, #I#, #J#
he comes home in a dying state from prison (to which he was consigned,
according to #I#, for robbing a church!). In these versions the story is
confused with that of another ballad, existing in Breton, and very
likely in French, 'Komt ar Chapel,' 'Le Comte des Chapelles,' Luzel, I,
456/457, or 'Le Page de Louis XIII,' Villemarqu['e], Barzaz-Breiz, p. 301.
A fragment of a corresponding Italian ballad is given by Nigra, Romania,
XI, 397, No 9.

Renaud, as it will be convenient to call the hero, coming home triste et
chagrin, #F#, #P#, #U b, c#, triste et bien malau #Y#, receives on his
arriving felicitations from his mother on account of the birth of a son.
He has no heart to respond to these: "Ni de ma femme, ni de mon fils, je
ne saurais me r['e]joui." He asks that his bed may be made, with
precautions against his wife's hearing. At midnight he is dead.

The wife, hearing the men-servants weeping, asks her mother-in-law the
cause. The best horse [horses] has been found dead in the stable, has
strayed away, etc., #B#, #D-S#, #GG#. "No matter for that," says the
wife; "when Renaud comes he will bring better," #B#, #D-G#, #L-Q#, #GG#.
The maids are heard weeping; why is that? They have lost, or injured,
sheets in the washing, #B#, #D#, #E#, #G#, #J#. When Renaud comes we
shall have better, #B#, #D#, #E#, #G#. Or a piece of plate has been lost
or broken, #A#, #F#, #H#, #I#, #K#, #O#. [It is children with the
toothache, #F#, #U a, b, c, d#]. "What is this chanting which I hear?"
It is a procession, making the tour of the house: #B#, #D-F#, #L#,
#P-X#, #GG#. "What gown shall I wear when I go to church?" Black is the
color for women at their churching, #B#, #F#, #I#, #L#, #M#, #O#, #P#,
#V#, #Y#; black is more becoming, plus joli, plus convenant, plus
cons['e]quent, #A#, #D#, #H#, #K#, #N#, #R#, #X#, #BB#, #DD#, #GG#;
"quittez le ros', quittez le gris, prenez le noir, pour mieux choisir,"
etc., #Q#, #W#, #U#, #E#, #S#, #T#.

Besides these four questions, all of which occur in Breton ballads,
there are two which are met with in many versions, always coming before
the last. "What is this pounding (frapper, cogner, taper) which I hear?"
It is carpenters, or masons, repairing some part of the house, #D#, #E#,
#K#, #L#, #N#, #P-U#, #W#; #A#, #V#, #X#, #AA#; #GG#. "Why are the bells
ringing?" For a procession, or because a distinguished personage has
come, has died, etc., #A#, #B#, #F-L#, #Q#, #R#, #W#, #Y#, #AA#, #DD#,
#GG#. On the way to church [or cemetery] herdboys or others say to one
another, as the lady goes by, That is the wife of the king, the
seigneur, that was buried last night, or the like; and the mother-in-law
has again to put aside the lady's question as to what they were saying,
#D#, #E#, #G#, #H#, #L-P#, #S#, #T#, #X#, #Y#, #FF#, #GG#.

Flambeaux or candles are burning at the church, #E#, #V#; a taper is
presented to the widow, #M#, or holy water, #N#, #T#, #Z#, #GG#; the
church is hung with black, #D#, #O#, #FF#; the funeral is going on,
#AA#, #CC#. "Whose is this new monument?" "What a fine tomb!" #M#, #N#,
#R#, #T#, #Z#, #GG#. The scene in other cases is transferred to the
cemetery. "Why has the earth been disturbed?" "What new monument is
this?" #A#, #DD#; #C#, #F#, #I#, #J#, #P#. In #B# the tomb is in the
garden; in #L#, #S#, #X#, #BB# the place is not defined.

The young wife utters a piercing shriek, #C#, #D#, #K#, #L#, #N#. Open
earth, split tomb, split tiles! #A#, #B#, #Q#, #R#, #V#, #W#, #X#, #Y#;
I will stay with my husband, will die with my husband, will not go back,
#A#, #C#, #D#, #M#, #N#, #Q#, #R#, #S#, #X#, #Y#, #Z#, #BB#, #CC#, #GG#.
She bids her mother take her keys, #B#, #C#, #G#, #L#, #M#, #P#, #Y#,
#BB#, #CC#, #GG#, and commits her son [children] to her kinsfolk, to
bring up piously, #B#, #G#, #I#, #J#, #L#, #M#, #O#, #Z#, #BB#, #CC#. In
#H#, #P#, #Q#, #W#, #X#, #Y# the earth opens, and in the last four it
encloses her. In #K# heaven is rent by her shriek, and she sees her
husband in light (who says, strangely, that his mouth smacks of rot); he
bids her bring up the children as Christians. Heaven opens to her prayer
in #AA#, and a voice cries, Wife, come up hither! In #GG# the voice from
heaven says, Go to your child: I will keep your husband safe. There are
other variations.[361]

#G#, #T#, #I# say expressly that Renaud's wife died the next day, or
after hearing three masses, or soon after. #M#, #O#, by a feeble modern
perversion, make her go into a convent.

#Italian# ballads cover very much the same ground as the French. The
versions hitherto published are:

Pontelagoscuro, p. 52, 16 verses, Romania, XI, 397, amended. #B.# 'Il

above, p. 84, Rivista di Filologia romanza, II, 196, 36 verses. All
these are from recent tradition.

The name Rinaldo, Rinald, is found only in _I_, #C#, and the latter has
also L[:u]is. L[:u]is is the name in #E#; Carlino, Carlin, in #J#, #H#;
Angiolino, Anzolin, #L#, #G#; Cagnolino, #M#. The rank is king in #C#,
#E#, #H-K#; prince, #D#; count, #G#, #L#, #M#.

#A# and #B#, corrupted fragments though they be, retain clear traces of
the ancient form of the story, and of the English variety of that form.
Under the bridge of the Rella [Diamantina] a woman is washing clothes,
gh' [e'] 'na lavandera. A knight passes, #B#, and apparently accosts
the laundress. She moves into the water, and the knight after her; the
knight embraces her, #A#. Dowy rade he hame, el va a c[a'] t[:u]to
moj[a'], #A#. In #B# (passing over some verses which have intruded) he
has many knife-stabs, and his horse many also.[362] He asks his mother
to put him to bed and his horse into the stable, and gives directions
about his funeral.

All of the story which precedes the hero's return home is either
omitted, #D#, #F#, #J#, #K#, #L#, or abridged to a single stanza: ven
da la cassa lo re Rinald, ven da la cassa, l'[e'] t[:u]t fer[i'], #C#;
ven da la guerra re Rinaldo, ven da la guerra, l'[e'] t[:u]t fer[i'],
#I#, #E#, #H#; save that #G#, which like #C# makes him to have been
hunting (and to have been bitten by a mad dog), adds that, while he
was hunting, his wife had given birth to a boy. #M# has an entirely
false beginning: Count Cagnolino was disposed to marry, but wished to
be secure about his wife's previous life. He had a marble statue in
his garden which moved its eyes when any girl that had gone astray
presented herself before it. The daughter of Captain Tartaglia having
been declined, for reason, and another young woman espoused, Tartaglia
killed the count while they were hunting.

The wounded man, already feeling the approach of death, #F#, #G#, #L#,
asks that his bed may be made; he shall die before the morrow, #D#, #F#,
#J#; let not his wife know, #F#, #G#. The wife asks why the
men-servants, coachmen, are weeping, and is told that they have drowned
[lost] some of the horses, #C-J#, #M# [have burned the king's carriage,
#K#]. We will get others when the king comes, she answers, #C#, #D#, #H#
[when I get up, #F#, as in Breton #A#]. Why are the maids weeping? The
maids have lost sheets or towels in washing, #F#, #I#, #K#; have
scorched the shirts in ironing, #C#, #D#, #H#. When the king comes, he
will buy or bring better, #C#, #D#, #H# [when I get up, #F#, as in
Breton #A#]. Why are the priests chanting? For a great feast to-morrow,
#F#. Why are the carpenters at work? They are making a cradle for your
boy, #C-E#, #H-K#. Why do the bells ring? A great lord is dead; in honor
of somebody or something; #C#, #E-L#. Why does not Anzolin come to see
me? He has gone a-hunting, #G#, #L#. What dress shall I put on to go to
church? [When I get up I shall put on red, #F#, #I#.] You in black and I
in gray, as in our country is the way, #C-F#, #H#, #I# [#H# moda a
_Paris_, by corruption of d[:e]l pais]; I white, you gray, #J#; you will
look well in black, #M#; put on red, or put on white, or put on black
for custom's sake, #G#.

The children in the street say, That is the wife of the lord who was
buried, or the people look at the lady in a marked way, #C#, #J#, #G#,
#M#; and why is this? For the last time the mother-in-law puts off the
question. At the church, under the family bench, there is a grave new
made, and now it has to be said that the husband is buried there, #C-K#,
#M#.

A conclusion is wanting in half of the ballads, and what there is is
corrupted in others. The widow commends her boy to her husband's mother,
#G#, #M#, and says she will die with her dear one, #D#, #E#, #J#, #M#.
In #C#, as in French #V#, she wishes to speak to her husband. If the
dead ever spake to the quick, she would speak once to her dear L[:u]is; if
the quick ever spake to the dead, she would speak once to her dear
husband. In #G# she bids the grave unlock, that she may come into the
arms of her beloved, and then bids it close, that in his arms she may
stay: cf. French #Y#, #Q#, #X#, #R#, #AA#.

The story of the Italian ballad, under the title of 'Il Conte
Angiolino,' was given in epitome by Luigi Carrer, in his Prose e Poesie,
Venice, 1838, IV, 81 f, before any copy had been published (omitted in
later editions). According to Carrer's version, the lady, hearing bells,
and seeing from her windows the church lighted up as for some office,
extracts the fact from her mother-in-law on the spot, and then, going to
the church and seeing her husband's tomb, prays that it would open and
receive her.

A fragment of an Italian ballad given by Nigra, Romania, XI, 396, No 8,
describes three card players, quarrelling over their game, as passing
from words to knives, and from knives to pistols, and one of the party,
the king of Spain, as being wounded in the fray. He rides home with a
depressed air, and asks his mother to make his bed, for he shall be dead
at midnight and his horse at dawn. There is a confusion of two stories
here, as will be seen from Spanish ballads which are to be spoken of.
Both stories are mixed with the original adventure of the mermaid in 'Il
Cavaliere della bella spada,' already referred to as #B#. In this last
the knight has a hundred and fifty stabs, and his horse ninety.[363]

Nigra has added to the valuable and beautiful ballads furnished to
Romania, XI, a tale (p. 398) from the province of Turin, which preserves
the earlier portion of the Breton story. A hunter comes upon a beautiful
woman under a rock. She requires him to marry her, and is told by the
hunter that he is already married. The beautiful woman, who is of course
a fairy, presents the hunter with a box for his wife, which he is not to
open. This box contains an explosive girdle, intended to be her death;
and the hunter's curiosity impelling him to examine the gift, he is so
much injured by a detonation which follows that he can just drag himself
home to die.

#Spanish.# This ballad is very common in Catalonia, and has been found
in Asturias. Since it is also known in Portugal, we may presume that it

The name of the husband is Don Joan de Sevilla, #D#, Don Joan, #F#, Don
Olalbo, #I#, Don Francisco, #J#, Don Pedro, #K#. His wife, a princess,
#A#, #G#, has given birth to a child, or is on the eve of so doing. The
gentleman is away from home, or is about to leave home on a pilgrimage
of a year and a day, #A#, #G#; has gone to war, #D#; to a hunt, #I#,
#K#. He dies just as he returns home or is leaving home, or away from
home, in other versions, but in #K# comes back in a dying condition, and
begs that his state may be concealed from his wife. The lady, hearing a
commotion in the house, and asking the cause, is told that it is the
noisy mirth of the servants, #A-D#. There is music, chanting, tolling of
bells; and this is said to be for a great person who has died, #B#, #D#,
#A#. In #B#, #D#, the wife asks, Can it be for my husband? In #J# the
mother-in-law explains her own sorrowful demeanor as occasioned by the
death of an uncle, and we are informed that the burial was without
bells, in order that the new mother might not hear. In #J# only do we
have the question, Where is my husband? He has been summoned to court,
says the mother-in-law, where, as a favorite, he will stay a year and
ten days. When should the young mother go to mass? Peasants go after a
fortnight, tradesfolk after forty days, etc.; she, as a great lady, will
wait a year and a day, #A#, #D#, #I#, a year, #B#, a year and ten days,
#J#. What dress should she wear, silk, gold tissue, silver? etc. Black
would become her best, #A#, #J#, #K#. [Do[~n]a Ana, in #K#, like the lady
in Italian #G#, resists the suggestion of mourning, as proper only for a
widow, and appears in a costume de Pascua florida: in some other copies
also she seems to wear a gay dress.] The people, the children, point to
her, and say, There is the widow, and her mother-in-law parries the
inquiry why she is the object of remark; but the truth is avowed when
they see a grave digging, and the wife asks for whom it is, #A#. In #J#
the lady sees a monument in the church, hung with black, reads her
husband's name, and swoons. #B#, #C# make the mother's explanation
follow upon the children's talk. In #K# the announcement is made first
by a shepherd, then confirmed by gaping spectators and by a rejected
lover. The widow commends her child to its grandmother, and says she
will go to her husband in heaven, #A-D#; dies on the spot, #K#; Don
Francisco dies in March, Do[~n]a Ana in May, #J#.

'Don Joan y Don Ramon' is a ballad in which a young man returns to his
mother mortally wounded, and therefore would be likely to blend in the
memory of reciters with any other ballad in which the same incident
occurred. A version from the Balearic Islands may be put first, which
has not yet taken up any characteristic part of the story of Renaud:
Recuerdos y Bellezas de Espa[~n]a, Mallorca, p. 336, 1842==Mil['a],
1853, p. 114, No 15, Briz, III, 172; Die Balearen in Wort und Bild
geschildert, by the Archduke Ludwig Salvator, Leipzig, 1871, II,
556.[364]

Don Joan and Don Ramon are returning from the chase. Don Ramon falls
from his horse; Don Joan rides off. Don Ramon's mother sees her son
coming through a field, gathering plants to heal his wounds. "What is
the matter?" she asks; "you are pale." "I have been bled, and they made
a mistake." "Ill luck to the barber!" "Curse him not; it is the last
time. Between me and my horse we have nine and twenty lance thrusts; the
horse has nine and I the rest. The horse will die to-night and I in the
morning. Bury him in the best place in the stable, and me in St Eulalia;
lay a sword crosswise over my grave, and if it is asked who killed me,
let the answer be, Don Joan de la cassada."

There are numerous Catalan versions, and most of them add something
to this story: Mil['a], 2d ed., 'El guerrero mal herido,' p. 171, No
210, #A-F#, #A_{1}-G_{1}#, #A_{11}#; Briz, III, 171 f, two copies.
These disagree considerably as to the cause of the hero's death, and
the names are not constant. In #A_{1}# of Mil['a], as in the Balearic
ballad, Don Joan and Don Ramon are coming from the chase, and have
a passage at lances; Don Joan is left dead, and Don Ramon is little
short of it. #A#, #B#, of Mil['a], tell us that Don Pedro died on the
field of battle and Don Joan came home mortally wounded. #E# says that
Don Joan and Don Ramon come from the chase, but Don Joan immediately
says that he comes from a great battle. It is battle in #F_{1}#, in
#E_{1}# (with Gast['o] returning), and in both the Catalan copies of
Briz, the hero being Don Joan in the first of these last, and in the
other nameless. The wounded man says he has been badly bled, Mil['a],
#A#, #B#, #A_{1}#, #C_{1}#, Briz 2; he and his horse have lance wounds
fifty-nine, thirty-nine, twenty-nine, etc., the horse nine and he the
rest, Mil['a], #A#, #B#, #E#, #A_{1}#, Briz 1. His mother informs him
that his wife has borne a child, "a boy like the morning star," Briz
1, and says that if he will go to the best chamber he will find her
surrounded by dames and ladies. This gives him no pleasure; he does
not care for wife, nor dames, nor ladies, nor boys, nor morning stars:
Briz 1, Mil['a], #A_{1}-G_{1}#. He asks to have his bed made, Mil['a],
#A-D#, #B_{1}#, #C_{1}#, Briz 1, 2, for he shall die at midnight and
his horse at dawn, #A-D#, #A_{1}#, Briz 2, and gives directions for his
burial and that of his horse. Let the bells toll when he is dead, and
when people ask for whom it is, the answer will be, For Don Joan, Briz
1, Gast['o], Mil['a], #E_{1}#, who was killed in battle. Let his arms
be put over the place where his horse is buried, and when people ask
whose arms they are his mother will say, My son's, who died in battle,
Mil['a] #A#, #B_{1}#. Let a drawn sword be laid across his grave, and
let those that ask who killed him be told, Don Joan, at the chase,
Mil['a], #A_{1}#.[365]

We have, probably, to do with two different ballads here, versions #A-F#
of Mil['a]'s 'Guerrero mal herido,' and Briz's second, belonging with 'Don
Joan y Don Ramon,' while #A_{1}-G_{1}# of Mil['a], and Briz's first,
represent a ballad of the Renaud class. It is, however, possible that
the first series may be imperfect copies of the second.

'Don Joan y Don Ramon' has agreements with Italian #B#, #A#: in #B#,
particularly, we note the hundred and fifty stabs of the knight and the
ninety of his horse.

#Portuguese.# A good Portuguese version, 'D. Pedro e D. Leonarda,' in
fifty short verses, unfortunately lacking the conclusion, has been
lately communicated to Romania (XI, 585) by Leite de Vasconcellos. Dom
Pedro went hunting, to be gone a year and a day, but was compelled to
return home owing to a malady which seized him. His mother greets him
with the information that his wife has given birth to a son. "Comfort
and cheer her," he says, "and for me make a bed, which I shall never
rise from." The wife asks, Where is my husband, that he does not come to
see me? "He has gone a-hunting for a year and a day," replies the
mother. What is this commotion in the house? "Only visitors." But the
bells are tolling! Could it be for my husband? "No, no; it is for a
feast-day." When do women go to mass after child-birth? "Some in three
weeks and some in two, but a lady of your rank after a year and a day."
And what color do they wear? "Some light blue and some a thousand
wonders, but you, as a lady of rank, will go in mourning." The ballad
stops abruptly with a half-pettish, half-humorous imprecation from the
daughter-in-law against the mother for keeping her shut up so long.

There is a Slavic ballad, which, like the versions that are so popular
with the Romance nations, abridges the first part of the story, and
makes the interest turn upon the gradual discovery of the hero's death,
but in other respects agrees with northern tradition.

The hero on his wedding day is making ready his horse to fetch the
bride; for he is, as in the Scandinavian ballads, not yet a married man.
His mother, Bohemian #A#, ascertaining his intention, begs him not to go
himself with the bridal escort. Obviously she has a premonition of
misfortune. Herman will never invite guests, and not go for them. The
mother, in an access of passion, exclaims, If you go, may you break your
neck, and never come back! Here we are reminded of the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad.
Bohemian #C#, #D# make the forebodings to rise in Herman's mind, not in
his mother's. The mother opposes the match in Bohemian #E#, and the
sister wishes that he may break his neck. Wendish #A# has nothing of
opposition or bodement before the start, but the crows go winging about
the young men who are going for the bride, and caw a horrible song, how
the bridegroom shall fall from his horse and break his neck. The train
sets off with a band of trumpets, drums, and stringed instruments, or,
Bohemian #D#, with a discharge of a hundred muskets, and when they come
to a linden in a meadow Herman's horse "breaks his foot," and the rider
his neck; Bohemian #D#, when they come to a copse in a meadow the
hundred pieces are again discharged, and Herman is mortally wounded. His
friends stand debating what they shall do. The dying man bids them keep
on: since the bride cannot be his, she shall be his youngest brother's,
Bohemian #A#, #C#; cf. Danish #L#, #O#, #R#, Norwegian #C#, #F#. The
train arrives at the bride's house; the bride comes out to greet them,
but, not seeing the bridegroom, inquires affrightedly what has become of
him. They pretend that he has remained at home to see to the tables. The
mother is reluctant to give them the bride, but finally yields. When the
train comes again to the linden in the mead, Dorothy sees blood. It is
Herman's! she cries; but they assure her that it is the blood of a deer
that Herman had killed for the feast. They reach Herman's house, where
the bride has an appalling reception, which need not be particularized.

In Bohemian #A#, while they are at supper (or at half-eve==three in the
afternoon), a death-bell is heard. Dorothy turns pale. For whom are they
tolling? Surely it is for Herman. They tell her that Herman is lying in
his room with a bad headache, and that the bell is ringing for a child.
But she guesses the truth, sinks down and dies, #a#. She wears two
knives in her hair, and thrusts one of them into her heart, #b#. The two
are buried in one grave. In Bohemian #B# the bell sounds for the first
time as the first course is brought on, and a second time when the
second course comes. The bride is told in each case that the knell is
for a child. Upon the third sounding, when the third course is brought
in, they tell her that it is for Herman. She seizes two knives and runs
to the graveyard: with one she digs herself a grave, and with the other
stabs herself. In the Wendish fragment #B#, at the first and second
course (there is no bell) the bride asks where the bridegroom is, and at
the third repeats the question with tears. She is told that he is
ranging the woods, killing game for his wedding. In Bohemian #C# the
bell tolls while they are getting the table ready. The bride asks if it
is for Herman, and is told that it is for a child. When they sit down to
table, the bells toll again. For whom should this be? For whom but
Herman? She springs out of the window, and the catastrophe is the same
as in Bohemian #B#. In #D# the bride hears the bell as the train is
approaching the house, and they say it is for a child. On entering the
court she asks where Herman is. He is in the cellar drawing wine for his
guests. She asks again for Herman as the company sits down to table, and
the answer is, In the chamber, lying in a coffin. She springs from the
table and rushes to the chamber, seizing two golden knives, one of which
she plunges into her heart. In Bohemian #E#, when the bride arrives at
John the bridegroom's house, and asks where he is, they tell her she had
better go to bed till midnight. The moment she touches John she springs
out of bed, and cries, Dear people, why have ye laid a living woman with
a dead man? They stand, saying, What shall we give her, a white cap or a
green chaplet? "I have not deserved the white (widow's) cap," she says;
"I have deserved a green chaplet." In Wendish #A#, when the bell first
knolls, the bride asks, Where is the bridegroom? and they answer, In the
new chamber, putting on his fine clothes. A second toll evokes a second
inquiry; and they say he is in the new room, putting on his sword. The
third time they conceal nothing: He fell off his horse and broke his
neck. "Then tear off my fine clothes and dress me in white, that I may
mourn a year and a day, and go to church in a green chaplet, and never
forget him that loved me!" It will be remembered that the bride takes
her own life in Norwegian #A#, #C#, #D#, and in Swedish #E#, as she does
in Bohemian #A b#, #B#, #C#, #D#.

    Clark Colven and his gay ladie,
      As they walked to yon garden green,
    A belt about her middle gimp,
      Which cost Clark Colven crowns fifteen:

    2
    'O hearken weel now, my good lord,
      O hearken weel to what I say;
    When ye gang to the wall o Stream,
      O gang nae neer the well-fared may.'

    3
    'O haud your tongue, my gay ladie,
      Tak nae sic care o me;
    For I nae saw a fair woman
      I like so well as thee.'

    4
    He mounted on his berry-brown steed,
      And merry, merry rade he on,
    Till he came to the wall o Stream,
      And there he saw the mermaiden.

    5
    'Ye wash, ye wash, ye bonny may,
      And ay's ye wash your sark o silk:'
    'It's a' for you, ye gentle knight,
      My skin is whiter than the milk.'

    6
    He's taen her by the milk-white hand,
      He's taen her by the sleeve sae green,
    And he's forgotten his gay ladie,
      And away with the fair maiden.

    'Ohon, alas!' says Clark Colven,

    And merrily leugh the mermaiden,
      'O win on till you be dead.

    8
    'But out ye tak your little pen-knife,
      And frae my sark ye shear a gare;
    Row that about your lovely head,
      And the pain ye'll never feel nae mair.'

    9
    Out he has taen his little pen-knife,
      And frae her sark he's shorn a gare,
    Rowed that about his lovely head,
      But the pain increased mair and mair.

    10
    'Ohon, alas!' says Clark Colven,
      'An aye sae sair's I mean my head!'
    And merrily laughd the mermaiden,
      'It will ay be war till ye be dead.'

    11
    Then out he drew his trusty blade,
      And thought wi it to be her dead,
    But she's become a fish again,
      And merrily sprang into the fleed.

    12
    He's mounted on his berry-brown steed,
      And dowy, dowy rade he home,
    And heavily, heavily lighted down
      When to his ladie's bower-door he came.

    Clerk Colvill and his lusty dame
      Were walking in the garden green;
    The belt around her stately waist
      Cost Clerk Colvill of pounds fifteen.

    'O promise me now, Clerk Colvill,

    'Now speak nae mair, my lusty dame,
      Now speak nae mair of that to me;

      But I wad sin with her body?'

    4
    He's taen leave o his gay lady,
      Nought minding what his lady said,
    And he's rode by the wells of Slane,
      Where washing was a bonny maid.

    5
    'Wash on, wash on, my bonny maid,
      That wash sae clean your sark of silk;'

    Then loud, loud cry'd the Clerk Colvill,
      'O my head it pains me sair;'
    'Then take, then take,' the maiden said,
      'And frae my sark you'll cut a gare.'

    7
    Then she's gied him a little bane-knife,
      And frae her sark he cut a share;
    She's ty'd it round his whey-white face,
      But ay his head it aked mair.

    Then louder cry'd the Clerk Colvill,
      'O sairer, sairer akes my head;'
    'And sairer, sairer ever will,'
      The maiden crys, 'till you be dead.'

    9
    Out then he drew his shining blade,
      Thinking to stick her where she stood,
    But she was vanishd to a fish,
      And swam far off, a fair mermaid.

    10
    'O mother, mother, braid my hair;

Copied from an old MS. in the possession of Alexander Fraser Tytler."
Note of Miss Mary Fraser Tytler. The first stanza agrees with that which
is cited from the original by Dr Anderson in Nichols's Illustrations,
VII, 177, and the number of stanzas is the same.

Colvill, which has become familiar from Herd's copy, is the correct
form, and Colven, Colvin, a vulgarized one, which in #C# lapses into
Colin.

Grundtvig. Kj[/o]benhavn, 1881.

[351] All the Norse versions are in two-line stanzas.

[352] In 'Jomfruen og Dv[ae]rgekongen,' #C# 25, 26, Grundtvig, No 37, the
woman who has been carried off to the hill, wishing to die, asks that
atter-corns may be put into her drink. She evidently gets, however, only
the villar-konn, elvar-konn, of Landstad, Nos 42-45, which are of
lethean property. But in J. og D. #F#, we may infer an atter-corn,
though none is mentioned, from the effect of the draughts, which is that
belt, stays, and sark successively burst. See p. 363 f.

[353] So, also, Swedish #A#, #F#, Norwegian #A#, #C#. This is a cantrip
sleight of the elves. The Icelandic burden supposes this illumination,
"The low was burning red;" and when Olaf seeks to escape, in Norwegian
#A#, #C#, #E#, #G#, #I#, #K#, he has to make his way through the
elf-flame, elvelogi.

[354] Grundtvig remarks that Herder's translation, 'Erlk[:o]nigs Tochter,'
Volkslieder, II, 158, took so well with the Germans that at last it came
to pass for an original German ballad. The Wunderhorn, I, 261, ed. 1806,
gives it with the title, 'Herr Olof,' as from a flying sheet
(==Scherer's Deutsche Volkslieder, 1851, p. 371). It appears, with some
little changes, in Zarnack's Deutsche Volkslieder, 1819, I, 29, whence
it passed into Erlach, IV, 6, and Richter und Marschner, p. 60.
Kretzschmer has the translation, again, with a variation here and there,
set to a "North German" and to a "Westphalian" air, p. 8, p. 9.

[355] Owing to a close resemblance of circumstances in 'The Elf-shot,'
in 'Frillens H[ae]vn' ('The Leman's Wreak'), Grundtvig, No 208, and in
'Ribold og Guldborg,' Grundtvig, No 82, these ballads naturally have
details in common. The pretence that the horse was not sure-footed
and hurtled his rider against a tree; the request to mother, father,
etc., to make the bed, take care of the horse, apply a bandage, send
for a priest, etc.; the testament, the assignment of the bride by the
dying man to his brother, and her declaration that she will never give
her troth to two brothers; and the nearly simultaneous death of hero,
bride, and mother, occur in many versions of both Elveskud and Ribold,
and most of them in Frillens H[ae]vn. A little Danish ballad, 'Hr.
Olufs D[/o]d,' cited by Grundtvig, IV, 847, seems to be Elveskud with
the elf-shot omitted.

[356] Luzel was in possession of other versions, but he assures us that
every detail is contained in one or the other of these three.

[357] #B# 13, "You must marry me straightway, or give me my weight in
silver;" _then_, "or die in three days," etc. It is not impossible that
this stanza, entirely out of place in this ballad, was derived from 'Le
Comte des Chapelles,' Luzel, p. 457, from which certain French versions
have taken a part of their story. See Luzel, the eighth and ninth
stanzas, on p. 461.

[358] #B# 50, "A white gown, or _broget_, or my violet petticoat?" Luzel
says he does not understand _broget_, and in his Observations, prefixed
to the volume, expresses a conjecture that it must have been altered
from _droged_, robe d'enfant, robe de femme, but we evidently want a
color. Grundtvig remarks that _broget_ would make sense in Danish, where
it means party-colored. Scotch _broakit_ is black and white. Icelandic
_br['o]k_, tartan, party-colored cloth, is said to be from Gaelic _breac_,
versicolor (Vigfusson). This points to a suitable meaning for Breton
_broget_.

[359] #D# adds: "It was a marvel to see, the night after husband and
wife had been buried, two oaks rise from the common tomb, and on their
branches two white doves, which sang there at daybreak, and then took
flight for the skies."

[360] It will be observed that some of the Renaud ballads in the Po['e]sies
populaires de la France were derived from earlier publications: such as
were communicated by collectors appear to have been sent in in 1852 or
1853. The versions cited by Rathery, Revue Critique, II, 287 ff, are all
from the MS. Po['e]sies populaires. #BB#, #CC# have either been overlooked
by me in turning over the first five volumes, or occur in vol. vi, which
has not yet been received. #GG# came to hand too late to be ranked at
its proper place.

[361] In #C# the mother-in-law tells her daughter, austerely:

    Vous aurez plut[^o]t trouv['e] un mari
    Que moi je n'aurai trouv['e] un fils.

So #E#, nearly. A mother makes a like remark to the betrothed of a dead
son in the Danish ballad of 'Ebbe Tygesen,' Grundtvig, Danske K[ae]mpeviser
og Folkesange, fornyede i gammel Stil, 1867, p. 122, st. 14. #F# and #T#
conclude with these words of the wife:

    'Ma m[e']re, dites au fossoyeur
    Qu'il creuse une fosse pour deux;
    'Et que l'espace y soit si grand
    Que l'on y mette aussi l'enfant.'

The burial of father, mother, and child in a common grave is found
elsewhere in ballads, as in 'Redselille og Medelvold,' Grundtvig, No
271, #A# 37, #G# 20, #M# 26, #X# 27.

[362] Shutting our eyes to other Romance versions, or, we may say,
opening them to Scandinavian ones, we might see in these stabs the
wounds made by the elf-knives in Danish #D#, #G#, #H#, #N#, #O#, #R#,
#X#, Swedish #G#, Norwegian #H#, #I#. See 'Don Joan y Don Ramon,'
further on.

[363] The ballad of 'Luggieri,' published by Salvatori in the Rassegna
Settimanale, Rome, June 22, 1879, and reprinted by Nigra in Romania, XI,
391 (a variety of 'Rizzardo bello,' Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, p.
62, No 83), appears to me not to belong with 'Renaud,' but with the
class of 'The Cruel Brother,' as already remarked of the Venetian ballad
at p. 142.

[364] The version in the Recuerdos was obtained in Majorca by Don J. M.
Quadrado. The editor remarks that the employment of the articles Il and
La instead of Es and Sa proves it to be as old as the sixteenth century.
Die Balearen, etc., is cited after Grundtvig.

[365] I do not entirely understand Professor Mil['a]'s arrangement of those
texts which he has not printed in full, and it is very likely that more
of his copies than I have cited exhibit some of the traits specified.

A song of 'Brume, brume on hil' is one of those named in The Complaint
of Scotland, 1549, p. 64 of Dr J. A. H. Murray's edition. "The foot of
the song" is sung, with others, by Moros in Wager's "very merry and
pithy Comedy called The longer thou livest the more fool thou art," c.
1568. 'Broom, broom on hil' is also one of Captain Cox's "bunch of
ballets and songs, all auncient," No 53 of the collection, 1575.[366]
The lines that Moros sings are:

    Brome, brome on hill,
    The gentle brome on hill, hill,
    Brome, brome on Hive hill,
    The gentle brome on Hive hill,
    The brome stands on Hive hill #a#.

"A more sanguine antiquary than the editor," says Scott, "might perhaps
endeavor to identify this poem, which is of undoubted antiquity, with
the 'Broom, broom on hill' mentioned ... as forming part of Captain
Cox's collection." Assuredly "Broom, broom on hill," if that were all,
would justify no such identification, but the occurrence of Hive hill,
both in the burden which Moros sings and in the eighth stanza of Scott's
ballad, is a circumstance that would embolden even a very cautious
antiquary, if he had received Hive hill from tradition, and was
therefore unaffected by a suspicion that this locality had been
introduced by an editor from the old song.[367]

Most of the versions give no explicit account of the knight's prolonged
sleep. He must needs be asleep when the lady comes to him, else there
would be no story; but his heavy slumber, not broken by all the efforts
of his horse and his hawk, is as a matter of course not natural; es geht
nicht zu mit rechten dingen; the witch-wife of #A# 4 is at the bottom of
that. And yet the broom-flowers strewed on his hals-bane in #A# 8, #B#
3, and the roses in #D# 6, are only to be a sign that the maid had been
there and was gone. Considering the character of many of Buchan's
versions, we cannot feel sure that #C# has not borrowed the second and
third stanzas from #B#, and the witch-wife, in the sixth, from #A#; but
it would be extravagant to call in question the genuineness of #C# as a
whole. The eighth stanza gives us the light which we require.

    'Ye'll pu the bloom frae aff the broom,
      Strew't at his head and feet,
    And aye the thicker that ye do strew,
      The sounder he will sleep.'

The silver belt about the knight's head in #A# 5 can hardly have to do
with his sleeping, and to me seems meaningless. It is possible that
roses are not used at random in #D# 6, though, like the posie of
pleasant perfume in #F# 9, they serve only to prove that the lady had
been there. An excrescence on the dog-rose, rosenschwamm, schlafkunz,
kunz, schlafapfel, it is believed in Germany, if laid under a man's
pillow, will make him sleep till it is taken away. Grimm, Deutsche
Mythologie, p. 1008, and Deutsches W[:o]rterbuch (Hildebrand), V, 2753 _e_.

#C# makes the lady hide in the broom to hear what the knight will say
when he wakes, and in this point agrees with the broadside #F#, as also
in the comment made by the men on their master in stanza 24; cf. #F# 16.

Mr J. W. Dixon has reprinted an Aldermary Churchyard copy of the
broadside, differing as to four or five words only from #F#, in Ancient
Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England, p. 116, Percy
Society, Volume XVII. The editor remarks that #A# is evidently taken
from #F#; from which it is clear that the pungent buckishness of the
broadside does not necessarily make an impression. #A# smells of the
broom; #F# suggests the groom.[368]

The sleep which is produced in #A# by strewing the flower of the broom
on a man's head and feet, according to a witch's advice, is brought
about in two Norse ballads by means not simply occult, but altogether
preternatural; that is, by the power of runes. One of these,
'S[:o]mn-runorna,' Arwidsson, II, 249, No 133, is preserved in a manuscript
of the end of the seventeenth, or the beginning of the eighteenth,
century. The other, 'S[:o]vnerunerne,' Grundtvig, II, 337, No 81, was taken
down in 1847 from the singing of a woman seventy-five years of age.

The Swedish ballad runs thus. There is a damsel in our land who every
night will sleep with a man, and dance a maid in the morning. The fame
of this comes to the ears of the son of the king of England, who orders
his horse, thinking to catch this damsel. When he arrives at the castle
gate, there stands the lady, and asks him what is his haste. He frankly
answers that he expects to get a fair maid's honor for his pains, and
she bids him follow her to the upper room. She lays sheets on the bed,
and writes strong runes on them. The youth sits down on the bed, and is
asleep before he can stretch himself out. He sleeps through that day,
and the next, and into the third. Then the lady rouses him. "Wake up;
you are sleeping your two eyes out." He is still so heavy that he can
hardly stir. He offers her his horse and saddle to report the matter as
he wishes. "Keep your horse," she says; "shame fa such liars."

The Danish story is much the same. One of a king's five sons goes to
make trial of the maid. She tells him to fasten his horse while she goes
before and unlocks; calls to her maid to bring five feather-beds,
feather-beds nine, and write a sleep on each of them. He sleeps through
three days, and is roused the fourth, with "Wake up, wake up; you have
slept away your pluck." He offers her a bribe, as before, which she
scornfully rejects, assuring him that he will not be spared when she
comes among maids and knights.

A sleep produced by runes or gramarye is one of the two main incidents
of a tale in the Gesta Romanorum, better known through the other, which
is the forfeit of flesh for money not forthcoming at the day set, as in
the Merchant of Venice: Latin, Oesterley, No 195, p. 603;[369] English,
Harleian MS. 7333, No 40, printed by Douce, Illustrations of Shakspere,
I, 281, Madden, p. 130, Herrtage, p. 158; German, No 68, of the printed
edition of 1489 (which I have not seen). A knight, who has a passion
for an emperor's daughter, engages to give a thousand [hundred] marks
for being once admitted to her bed. He instantly falls asleep, and has
to be roused in the morning. Like terms are made for a second night, and
the man's lands have to be pledged to raise the money. He sleeps as
before, but stipulates for a third night at the same price. A merchant
lends him the thousand marks, on condition that, if he breaks his day,
his creditor may take the money's weight of flesh from his body. Feeling
what a risk he is now running, the knight consults a philosopher,
Virgil, in the English version. The philosopher (who in the Latin
version says he ought to know, for he had helped the lady to her trick)
tells the knight that between the sheet and coverlet of the bed there is
a letter, which causes the sleep; this he must find, and, when found,
cast far from the bed. The knight follows these directions, and gets the
better of the lady, who conceives a reciprocal passion for him, and
delivers him, in the sequel, from the fearful penalty of his bond by
pleading that the flesh must be taken without shedding of blood.

The romance of Dolopathos, a variety of the Seven Wise Masters, written
about 1185, considerably before the earliest date which has hitherto
been proposed for the compilation of the Gesta, has this story, with
variations, of which only these require to be noted. The lady has
herself been a student in magic. She is wooed of many; all comers are
received, and pay a hundred marks; any one who accomplishes his will
may wed her the next day. An enchanted feather of a screech-owl, laid
under the pillow, makes all who enter the bed fall asleep at once,
and many have been baffled by this charm. At last a youth of high
birth, but small means, tries his fortune, and, failing at the first
essay, tries once more. Thinking that the softness of his couch was
the cause of his falling asleep, he puts away the pillow, and in this
process the feather is thrown out: Iohannis de Alta Silva Dolopathos,
ed. Oesterley, pp 57-59; Herbers, Li Romans de Dolopathos, Brunet et
Montaiglon, vv 7096-7498, pp 244-59; Le Roux de Lincy, in a sequel
to Loiseleur-Deslongchamps's Essai sur les Fables indiennes, pp 211
ff. This form of the tale is found in German, in a fifteenth-century
manuscript, from which it was printed by Haupt in Altdeutsche
Bl[:a]tter, I, 143-49; but here the sleep is produced by the use of
_both_ the means employed in the Gesta and in Dolopathos, letter
(runes) and feather, "the wild man's feather."[370]

Magic is dropped, and a sleeping draught administered, just as the man
is going to bed, in a version of the story in the Pecorone of Ser
Giovanni Fiorentino, Giornata, IV^a, Nov. 1_{a} (last quarter of the
fourteenth century). Upon the third trial the man, warned by a friendly
chambermaid not to drink, pours the medicated wine into his bosom. The
account of Ser Giovanni is adopted in Les Adventures d'Abdalla fils
d'Hanif, etc., La Haye, 1713, Biblioth[e']que de Romans, 1778, Janvier, I,
112-14, 143 f.

Ellin writes sleep-runes on the cushions on which her husband is to
sleep, in the Danish ballad 'Fr[ae]ndeh[ae]vn,' Grundtvig, No 4, #A# 33
[#C# 45].

In Icelandic tales a sleep-thorn[371] is employed, probably a thorn
inscribed with runes. The thorn is stuck into the clothes or into
the head (the ears, according to the popular notion, Vigfusson), and
the sleep lasts till the thorn is taken out. Odin stuck such a thorn
into Brynhild's garments: F['a]fnism['a]l, 43; Sigrdr['i]fum['a]l,
7; V[:o]ls['u]nga Saga, Fornaldar S[:o]gur, I, 166. The thorn is put
into the clothes also in the Icelandic fairy-tale, M[ae]r[th][:o]ll,
Maurer, Isl[:a]ndische Volkssagen, p. 286. ['O]l[:o]f, to save herself
from Helgi's violence, and to punish his insolence, sticks him with
a sleep-thorn after he is dead drunk: Hr['o]lfs Saga Kraka, Forn.
S. I, 18f, Torf[ae]us, p. 32. Vilhj['a]lmr sticks a sleep-thorn into
Hr['o]lfr, and he lies as if dead so long as the thorn is in him:
Gaungu-Hr['o]lfs Saga, Forn. S., III, 303, 306.

A pillow of soporific quality, which Kamele, by Isot's direction, puts
under Kaedin's head, assures her safety though she lies all night by his
side: Ulrich's continuation of Gottfried's Tristan, vv 1668-99, 1744-85;
and Heinrich's continuation, omitting the last circumstance, vv
4861-4960 (J. Grimm).

The witch-woman, in the English ballad, #A# 4, represents the
philosopher in the Gesta, and the wager in the other versions the fee or
fine exacted by the lady in the Gesta and elsewhere.

An Italian ballad, a slight and unmeritable thing, follows the story of
Ser Giovanni, or agrees with it, in respect to the sleeping-draught. A
man falls in with a girl at a spring, and offers her a hundred ducats,
or scudi, per una nottina. The girl says that she must consult her
mother. The mother advises her to accept the offer: she will give the
man a drug, and the money will serve for a dowry. The man, roused in the
morning, counts out the money with one hand and wipes his eyes with the
other. When asked why he is crying, he replies that the money is not the
loss he weeps for, and makes a second offer of the same amount. The girl
wishes to refer the matter to her mother again, but the gallant says the
mother shall not take him in a second time. One version (#A#) ends
somewhat more respectably: the girl declares that, having come off with
her honor once, she will not again expose herself to shame. #A.#

'The Sleepy Merchant,' a modern ballad, in Kinloch's MSS, V, 26, was
perhaps fashioned on some traditional report of the story in Il
Pecorone. The girl gives the merchant a drink, and when the sun is up
starts to her feet, crying, "I'm a leal maiden yet!" The merchant comes
back, and gets another dram, but "tooms it a' between the bolster and
the wa," and then sits up and sings.

A ballad found everywhere in Germany, but always in what appears to be
an extremely defective form, must originally, one would think, have had
some connection with those which we are considering. A hunter meets
a girl on the heath, and takes her with him to his hut, where they
pass the night. She rouses him in the morning, and proclaims herself
still a maid. The hunter is so chagrined that he is of a mind to kill
her, but spares her life. 'Der J[:a]ger,' 'Der ernsthafte J[:a]ger,'

    There was a knight and a lady bright,
      Had a true tryste at the broom;
    The ane gaed early in the morning,
      The other in the afternoon.

    2
    And ay she sat in her mother's bower door,
      And ay she made her mane:
    'O whether should I gang to the Broomfield Hill,
      Or should I stay at hame?

    3
    'For if I gang to the Broomfield Hill,
      My maidenhead is gone;
    And if I chance to stay at hame,
      My love will ca me mansworn.'

    4
    Up then spake a witch-woman,
      Ay from the room aboon:
    'O ye may gang to the Broomfield Hill,
      And yet come maiden hame.

    5
    'For when ye gang to the Broomfield Hill,
      Ye'll find your love asleep,
    With a silver belt about his head,
      And a broom-cow at his feet.

    6
    'Take ye the blossom of the broom,
      The blossom it smells sweet,
    And strew it at your true-love's head,
      And likewise at his feet.

    7
    'Take ye the rings off your fingers,
      Put them on his right hand,
    To let him know, when he doth awake,
      His love was at his command.'

    8
    She pu'd the broom flower on Hive Hill,
      And strewd on 's white hals-bane,
    And that was to be wittering true
      That maiden she had gane.

    9
    'O where were ye, my milk-white steed,
      That I hae coft sae dear,
    That wadna watch and waken me
      When there was maiden here?'

    10
    'I stamped wi my foot, master,
      And gard my bridle ring,
    But na kin thing wald waken ye,
      Till she was past and gane.'

    11
    'And wae betide ye, my gay goss-hawk,
      That I did love sae dear,
    That wadna watch and waken me
      When there was maiden here.'

    12
    'I clapped wi my wings, master,
      And aye my bells I rang,
    And aye cry'd, Waken, waken, master,
      Before the ladye gang.'

    13
    'But haste and haste, my gude white steed,
      To come the maiden till,
    Or a' the birds of gude green wood
      Of your flesh shall have their fill.'

    14
    'Ye need na burst your gude white steed
      Wi racing oer the howm;
    Nae bird flies faster through the wood,
      Than she fled through the broom.'

    She's pu'd the blooms aff the broom-bush,

    1
    There was a knight and lady bright
      Set trysts amo the broom,
    The one to come at morning ear,
      The other at afternoon.

    2
    'I'll wager a wager wi you,' he said,
      'An hundred merks and ten,
    That ye shall not go to Broomfield Hills,
      Return a maiden again.'

    3
    'I'll wager a wager wi you,' she said,
      'A hundred pounds and ten,
    That I will gang to Broomfield Hills,
      A maiden return again.'

    4
    The lady stands in her bower door,
      And thus she made her mane:
    'O shall I gang to Broomfield Hills,
      Or shall I stay at hame?

    5
    'If I do gang to Broomfield Hills,
      A maid I'll not return;
    But if I stay from Broomfield Hills,
      I'll be a maid mis-sworn.'

    6
    Then out it speaks an auld witch-wife,
      Sat in the bower aboon:
    'O ye shall gang to Broomfield Hills,
      Ye shall not stay at hame.

    7
    'But when ye gang to Broomfield Hills,
      Walk nine times round and round;
    Down below a bonny burn bank,
      Ye'll find your love sleeping sound.

    8
    'Ye'll pu the bloom frae aff the broom,
      Strew 't at his head and feet,
    And aye the thicker that ye do strew,
      The sounder he will sleep.

    9
    'The broach that is on your napkin,
      Put it on his breast bane,
    To let him know, when he does wake,
      That's true love's come and gane.

    10
    'The rings that are on your fingers,
      Lay them down on a stane,
    To let him know, when he does wake,
      That's true love's come and gane.

    11
    'And when ye hae your work all done,
      Ye'll gang to a bush o' broom,
    And then you'll hear what he will say,
      When he sees ye are gane.'

    12
    When she came to Broomfield Hills,
      She walkd it nine times round,
    And down below yon burn bank,
      She found him sleeping sound.

    13
    She pu'd the bloom frae aff the broom,
      Strew'd it at 's head and feet,
    And aye the thicker that she strewd,
      The sounder he did sleep.

    14
    The broach that was on her napkin,
      She put on his breast bane,
    To let him know, when he did wake,
      His love was come and gane.

    15
    The rings that were on her fingers,
      She laid upon a stane,
    To let him know, when he did wake,
      His love was come and gane.

    16
    Now when she had her work all dune,
      She went to a bush o broom,
    That she might hear what he did say,
      When he saw she was gane.

    17
    'O where were ye, my guid grey hound,
      That I paid for sae dear,
    Ye didna waken me frae my sleep
      When my true love was sae near?'

    18
    'I scraped wi my foot, master,
      Till a' my collars rang,
    But still the mair that I did scrape,
      Waken woud ye nane.'

    19
    'Where were ye, my berry-brown steed,
      That I paid for sae dear,
    That ye woudna waken me out o my sleep
      When my love was sae near?'

    20
    'I patted wi my foot, master,
      Till a' my bridles rang,
    But still the mair that I did patt,
      Waken woud ye nane.'

    21
    'O where were ye, my gay goss-hawk,
      That I paid for sae dear,
    That ye woudna waken me out o my sleep
      When ye saw my love near?'

    22
    'I flapped wi my wings, master,
      Till a' my bells they rang,
    But still the mair that I did flap,
      Waken woud ye nane.'

    23
    'O where were ye, my merry young men,
      That I pay meat and fee,
    Ye woudna waken me out o' my sleep
      When my love ye did see?'

    24
    'Ye'll sleep mair on the night, master,
      And wake mair on the day;
    Gae sooner down to Broomfield Hills
      When ye've sic pranks to play.

    25
    'If I had seen any armed men
      Come riding over the hill--
    But I saw but a fair lady
      Come quietly you until.'

    26
    'O wae mat worth you, my young men,
      That I pay meat and fee,
    That ye woudna waken me frae sleep
      When ye my love did see.

    27
    'O had I waked when she was nigh,
      And o her got my will,
    I shoudna cared upon the morn
      Tho sma birds o her were fill.'

    28
    When she went out, right bitter wept,
      But singing came she hame;
    Says, I hae been at Broomfield Hills,
      And maid returnd again.

    'I'll wager, I'll wager,' says Lord John,
      'A hundred merks and ten,
    That ye winna gae to the bonnie broom-fields,
      And a maid return again.'

    2
    'But I'll lay a wager wi you, Lord John,
      A' your merks oure again,
    That I'll gae alane to the bonnie broom-fields,
      And a maid return again.'

    3
    Then Lord John mounted his grey steed,
      And his hound wi his bells sae bricht,
    And swiftly he rade to the bonny broom-fields,
      Wi his hawks, like a lord or knicht.

    4
    'Now rest, now rest, my bonnie grey steed,
      My lady will soon be here,
    And I'll lay my head aneath this rose sae red,
      And the bonnie burn sae near.'

    5
    But sound, sound was the sleep he took,
      For he slept till it was noon,
    And his lady cam at day, left a taiken and away,
      Gaed as licht as a glint o the moon.

    6
    She strawed the roses on the ground,
      Threw her mantle on the brier,
    And the belt around her middle sae jimp,
      As a taiken that she'd been there.

    7
    The rustling leaves flew round his head,
      And rousd him frae his dream;
    He saw by the roses, and mantle sae green,
      That his love had been there and was gane.

    8
    'O whare was ye, my gude grey steed,
      That I coft ye sae dear,
    That ye didna waken your master,
      Whan ye kend that his love was here?'

    9
    'I pautit wi my foot, master,
      Garrd a' my bridles ring,
    And still I cried, Waken, gude master,
      For now is the hour and time.'

    10
    'Then whare was ye, my bonnie grey hound,
      That I coft ye sae dear,
    That ye didna waken your master,
      Whan ye kend that his love was here?'

    11
    'I pautit wi my foot, master,
      Garrd a' my bells to ring,
    And still I cried, Waken, gude master,
      For now is the hour and time.'

    12
    'But whare was ye, my hawks, my hawks,
      That I coft ye sae dear,
    That ye didna waken your master,
      Whan ye kend that his love was here?'

    13
    'O wyte na me, now, my master dear,
      I garrd a' my young hawks sing,
    And still I cried, Waken, gude master,
      For now is the hour and time.'

    14
    'Then be it sae, my wager gane,
      'T will skaith frae meikle ill,
    For gif I had found her in bonnie broom-fields,
      O her heart's blude ye'd drunken your fill.'

    3
    But when she cam to the bonnie green bower,
      Her true-love was fast asleep;
    Sumtimes she kist his rosie, rosie lips,
      An his breath was wondrous sweet.

    She's taen a ring frae her finger,

    1
    A noble young squire that livd in the west,
      He courted a young lady gay,
    And as he was merry, he put forth a jest,
      A wager with her he would lay.

    2
    'A wager with me?' the young lady reply'd,
      'I pray, about what must it be?
    If I like the humour you shan't be deny'd;
      I love to be merry and free.'

    3
    Quoth he, 'I will lay you an hundred pounds,
      A hundred pounds, aye, and ten,
    That a maid if you go to the merry broomfield,
      That a maid you return not again.'

    4
    'I'll lay you that wager,' the lady she said,
      Then the money she flung down amain;
    'To the merry broomfield I'll go a pure maid,
      The same I'll return home again.'

    5
    He coverd her bett in the midst of the hall
      With an hundred and ten jolly pounds,
    And then to his servant straightway he did call,
      For to bring forth his hawk and his hounds.

    6
    A ready obedience the servant did yield,
      And all was made ready oer night;
    Next morning he went to the merry broomfield,
      To meet with his love and delight.

    7
    Now when he came there, having waited a while,
      Among the green broom down he lies;
    The lady came to him, and coud not but smile,
      For sleep then had closed his eyes.

    8
    Upon his right hand a gold ring she secur'd,
      Down from her own finger so fair,
    That when he awaked he might be assur'd
      His lady and love had been there.

    9
    She left him a posie of pleasant perfume,
      Then stept from the place where he lay;
    Then hid herself close in the besom of the broom,
      To hear what her true-love would say.

    10
    He wakend and found the gold ring on his hand,
      Then sorrow of heart he was in:
    'My love has been here, I do well understand,
      And this wager I now shall not win.

    11
    'O where was you, my goodly gawshawk,
      The which I have purchasd so dear?
    Why did you not waken me out of my sleep
      When the lady, my lover, was here?'

    12
    'O with my bells did I ring, master,
      And eke with my feet did I run;
    And still did I cry, Pray awake, master,
      She's here now, and soon will be gone.'

    13
    'O where was you, my gallant greyhound,
      Whose collar is flourishd with gold?
    Why hadst thou not wakend me out of my sleep
      When thou didst my lady behold?'

    14
    'Dear master, I barkd with my mouth when she came,
      And likewise my coller I shook,
    And told you that here was the beautiful dame,
      But no notice of me then you took.'

    15
    'O where was thou, my serving-man,
      Whom I have cloathed so fine?
    If you had wak'd me when she was here,
      The wager then had been mine.'

    16
    'In the night ye should have slept, master,
      And kept awake in the day;
    Had you not been sleeping when hither she came,
      Then a maid she had not gone away.'

    17 Then home he returnd, when the wager was lost,
      With sorrow of heart, I may say;
    The lady she laughd to find her love crost,--
      This was upon midsummer-day.

    18
    'O squire, I laid in the bushes conceald,
      And heard you when you did complain;
    And thus I have been to the merry broomfield,
      And a maid returnd back again.

    19
    'Be chearful, be chearful, and do not repine,
      For now 't is as clear as the sun,
    The money, the money, the money is mine,
      The wager I fairly have won.'

[367] Motherwell remarks, at page 42 of his Introduction, "The song is
popular still, and is often to be met with." It was printed in a cheap
American song-book, which I have not been able to recover, under the
title of 'The Green Broomfield,' and with some cis-atlantic variations.
Graham's Illustrated Magazine, September, 1858, gives these stanzas:

    "Then when she went to the green broom field,
      Where her love was fast asleep,
    With a gray _goose_-hawk and a green laurel bough,
      And a green broom under his feet.

    "And when he awoke from out his sleep,
      An angry man was he;
    He looked to the East, and he looked to the West,
      And he wept for his sweetheart to see.

    "Oh! where was you, my gray _goose_-hawk,
      The hawk that I loved so dear,
    That you did not awake me from out my sleep,
      When my sweetheart was so near?"

THE TWA MAGICIANS

        Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 24;
        Motherwell's MS., p. 570.


A base-born cousin of a pretty ballad known over all Southern Europe,
and elsewhere, and in especially graceful forms in France.

The French ballad generally begins with a young man's announcing that he
has won a mistress, and intends to pay her a visit on Sunday, or to give
her an _aubade_. She declines his visit, or his music. To avoid him she
will turn, e. g., into a rose; then he will turn bee, and kiss her. She
will turn quail; he sportsman, and bag her. She will turn carp; he
angler, and catch her. She will turn hare; and he hound. She will turn
nun; he priest, and confess her day and night. She will fall sick; he
will watch with her, or be her doctor. She will become a star; he a
cloud, and muffle her. She will die; he will turn earth, into which they
will put her, or St Peter, and receive her into Paradise. In the end she
says, Since you are inevitable, you may as well have me as another; or
more complaisantly, Je me donnerai [a'] toi, puisque tu m'aimes tant.

This ballad might probably be found anywhere in France, but most of
the known versions are from south of the Loire. #A.# Romania, X,
390, E. Legrand, from Normandy; also known in Champagne. #B.# 'Les
Transformations,' V. Smith, Vielles Chansons du Velay et du Forez,

Rom[^a]nilor, p. 7, No 3; French version, by the same, Ballades et Chants
populaires, p. 35, No 7; Schuller, Rom[:a]nische Volkslieder, p. 47. The
cuckoo, or the lover under that style, asks the dove to be his mistress
till Sunday. The dove, for his sake, would not say No, but because of
his mother, who is a witch, if not let alone will change into a roll,
and hide under the ashes. Then he will turn into a shovel, and get her
out. She will turn into a reed, and hide in the pond. He will come as
shepherd to find a reed for a flute, put her to his lips, and cover her
with kisses. She will change to an image, and hide in the depths of the
church. He will come every day in the week, as deacon or chorister, to
kiss the images (a pious usage in those parts), and she will not thus
escape him. Schuller refers to another version, in Schuster's unprinted
collection, in which youth and maid carry on this contest in their
proper persons, and not under figure.

#Ladin.# Flugi, Die Volkslieder des Engadin, p. 83, No 12. "Who is the
younker that goes a-field ere dawn? Who is his love?" "A maid all too
fair, with dowry small enough." "Maid, wilt give me a rose?" "No; my
father has forbidden." "Wilt be my love?" "Rather a seed, and hide in
the earth." "Then I will be a bird, and pick thee out," etc.

#Greek.# Tommaseo, III, 61, Passow, p. 431, No 574a. A girl tells her
mother she will kill herself rather than accept the Turk: she will turn
swallow, and take to the woods. The mother replies, Turn what you will,
he will turn hunter, and take you from me. The same kernel of this
ballad of transformations in Comparetti, Saggi dei Dialetti greci dell'
Italia meridionale, p. 38, No 36, as M. Paul Meyer has remarked, Revue
Critique, II, 302.

The ballad is well known to the Slavic nations.

#Moravian.# [vC]elakovsk['y], p. 75, No 6, Wenzig, Slawische Volkslieder,
p. 72, Bibliothek slavischer Poesien, p. 92. A youth threatens to carry
off a maid for his wife. She will fly to the wood as a dove. He has a
rifle that will bring her down. She will jump into the water as a fish.
He has a net that will take the fish. She will turn to a hare; he to a
dog; she cannot escape him.

#Polish.# Very common. #A a.# Wac[/l]aw z Oleska, p. 417, No 287;
Konopka, p. 124. A young man says, though he should ride night and day
for it, ride his horse's eyes out, the maid must be his. She will turn
to a bird, and take to the thicket. But carpenters have axes which can
fell a wood. Then she will be a fish, and take to the water. But
fishermen have nets which will find her. Then she will become a wild
duck, and swim on the lake. Sportsmen have rifles to shoot ducks. Then
she will be a star in the sky, and give light to the people. He has a
feeling for the poor, and will bring the star down to the earth by his
prayers. "I see," she says, "it's God's ordinance; whithersoever I
betake myself, you are up with me; I will be yours after all." Nearly
the same mutations in other versions, with some variety of introduction
and arrangement. #A b.# Kolberg, Lud, VI, 129, No 257. #A c.#

#Servian.# Karadshitch, I, 434, No 602; Talvj, II, 100; Kapper, II, 208;
Pellegrini, p. 37. Rather than be her lover's, the maid will turn into a
gold-jug in a drinking-house; he will be mine host. She will change into
a cup in a coffee-house; he will be _cafetier_. She will become a quail,
he a sportsman; a fish, he a net. Pellegrini has still another form, 'La
fanciulla assediata,' p. 93. An old man desires a maid. She will rather
turn into a lamb; he will turn into a wolf. She will become a quail; he
a hawk. She will change into a rose; he into a goat, and tear off the
rose from the tree.

There can be little doubt that these ballads are derived, or take their
hint, from popular tales, in which (1) a youth and maid, pursued by a
sorcerer, fiend, giant, ogre, are transformed by the magical powers of
one or the other into such shapes as enable them to elude, and finally
to escape, apprehension; or (2) a young fellow, who has been apprenticed
to a sorcerer, fiend, etc., and has acquired the black art by
surreptitious reading in his master's books, being pursued, as before,
assumes a variety of forms, and his master others, adapted to the
destruction of his intended victim, until the tables are turned by the
fugitive's taking on the stronger figure and despatching his adversary.

Specimens of the first kind are afforded by Gonzenbach, Sicilianische
M[:a]rchen, Nos 14, 15, 54, 55; Grimms, Nos 51, 56, 113; Schneller, No 27;
Pitr[e'], Fiabe, Novelle e Racconti siciliani, No 15; Imbriani, Novellaja
milanese, No 27, N. fiorentana, No 29; Maspons y Labr['o]s, Rondallayre, I,
85, II, 30; Cosquin, Contes lorrains, in Romania, V, 354; Ralston's
Russian Folk-Tales, p. 129 f, from Afanasief V, No 23; Bechstein,
M[:a]rchenbuch, p. 75, ed. 1879, which combines both. Others in K[:o]hler's
note to Gonzenbach, No 14, at II, 214.

Of the second kind, among very many, are Straparola, viii, 5, see
Grimms, III, 288, Louveau et Larivey, II, 152; Grimms, Nos 68, 117;
M[:u]llenhoff, No 27, p. 466; Pr[:o]hle, M[:a]rchen f[:u]r die Jugend,
No 26; Asbj[/o]rnsen og Moe, No 57; Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder,
1854, Nos 255, 256; Hahn, Griechische M[:a]rchen, No 68; the Breton
tale Koadalan, Luzel, in Revue Celtique, I, 106/107; the Schotts,
Walachische M[ae]rchen, No 18;[374] Woicicki, Klechdy, II, 26, No 4;
Karadshitch, No 6; Afanasief, V, 95 f, No 22, VI, 189 ff, No 45 a, b,
and other Russian and Little Russian versions, VIII, 340. K[:o]hler
adds several examples of one kind or the other in a note to Koadalan,
Revue Celtique, I, 132, and Wollner Slavic parallels in a note to
Leskien und Brugman, Litanische Volkslieder und M[:a]rchen, p. 537 f.

The usual course of events in these last is that the prentice takes
refuge in one of many pomegranate kernels, barley-corns, poppy-seeds,
millet-grains, pearls; the master becomes a cock, hen, sparrow, and
picks up all of these but one, which turns into a fox, dog, weasel,
crow, cat, hawk, vulture, that kills the bird.

The same story occurs in the Turkish Forty Viziers, Behrnauer, p. 195
ff, the last transformations being millet, cock, man, who tears off
the cock's head. Also in the introduction to Siddhi-K[:u]r, J[:u]lg,
pp 1-3, where there are seven masters instead of one, and the final
changes are worms, instead of seeds, seven hens, a man with a cane who
kills the hens.[375]

The pomegranate and cock (found in Straparola) are among the
metamorphoses in the contest between the afrite and the princess in the
tale of the Second Calender in the Arabian Nights.

Entirely similar is the pursuit of Gwion the pigmy by the goddess
Koridgwen, cited by Villemarqu['e], Barzaz Breiz, p. lvi, ed. 1867, from
the Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, I, 17. Gwion having, by an accident,
come to the knowledge of superhuman mysteries, Koridgwen wishes to take
his life. He flees, and turns successively into a hare, fish, bird; she
follows, in the form of hound, otter, hawk; finally he becomes a wheaten
grain, she a hen, and swallows the grain.

The ordinary tale has found its way into rhyme in a German broadside
ballad, Longard, Altrheinl[:a]ndische M[:a]hrlein und Liedlein, p. 76,
No 40, 'Von einem gottlosen Zauberer und seiner unschuldigen Kindlein
wunderbarer Erl[:o]sung.' The two children of an ungodly magician,
a boy and a girl, are devoted by him to the devil. The boy had read
in his father's books while his father was away. They flee, and are
pursued: the girl becomes a pond, the boy a fish. The wicked wizard
goes for a net. The boy pronounces a spell, by which the girl is turned
into a chapel, and he into an image on the altar. The wizard, unable
to get at the image, goes for fire. The boy changes the girl into a
threshing-floor, himself into a barley-corn. The wizard becomes a hen,
and is about to swallow the grain of barley. By another spell the boy
changes himself into a fox, and then twists the hen's neck.

    The lady stands in her bower door,

    Then she has hadden up her hand,

[373] There are two other versions in this great collection besides the
five cited, but either I have overlooked these, or they are in Volume
VI, not yet received.

[374] The Schotts are reminded by their story that Wade puts his son
Weland in apprenticeship to Mimir Smith, and to the dwarfs. They might
have noted that the devil, in the Wallachian tale, wishes to keep his
prentice a second year, as the dwarfs wish to do in the case of Weland.
That little trait comes, no doubt, from Weland's story; but we will not,
therefore, conclude that our smith is Weland Smith, and his adventure
with the lady founded upon that of Weland with Nidung's daughter.

[375] See Benfey, Pantschatantra, I, 410 f, who maintains the Mongol
tale to be of Indian origin, and thinks the story to have been derived
from the contests in magic between Buddhist and Brahman saints, of which
many are related in Buddhist legends.

_new_ ballad of King John and the Abbot of Canterbury, to the tune of
'The King and the Lord Abbot.'[376] This older ballad seems not to have
come down.

There are at least two other broadsides extant upon the same subject,
both mentioned by Percy, and both inferior even to #B#, and in a far
less popular style: 'The King and the Bishop,' Pepys, I, 472, No 243,
Roxburghe, III, 170, Douce, fol. 110; and 'The Old Abbot and King
Olfrey,' Douce, II, fol. 169, Pepys, II, 127, No 111, printed in Old
Ballads, II, 55.[377] In both of these the Shepherd is the Bishop's
brother, which he is not in #B#; in #A# he is half-brother. Pepys's
Penny Merriments contain, I, 14, 'The pleasant History of King Henry the
Eighth and the Abbot of Reading.'[378] This last may, without rashness,
be assumed to be a variation of 'King John and the Abbot.'

Percy admitted 'King John and the Abbot' to his Reliques, II, 302,
introducing many lines from #A# "worth reviving," and many improvements
of his own,[379] and thus making undeniably a very good ballad out of a
very poor one.

The story of this ballad was told in Scotland, some fifty years ago, of
the Gudeman of Ballengeigh, James the V, the hero of not a few other
tales. Once on a time, falling in with the priest of Markinch (near
Falkland), and finding him a dullard, he gave the poor man four
questions to think of till they next met, with an intimation that his
benefice would be lost were they not rightly answered. The questions
were those of our ballad, preceded by Where is the middle of the earth?
The parson could make nothing of them, and was forced to resort to a
miller of the neighborhood, who was reputed a clever fellow. When called
to answer the first question, the miller put out his staff, and said,
There, as your majesty will find by measuring. The others were dealt
with as in the ballad. The king said that the miller should have the
parson's place, but the miller begged off from this in favor of the
incumbent. Small, Interesting Roman Antiquities recently discovered in
Fife, p. 289 ff.

Riddle stories in which a forfeit is to be paid by a vanquished party
have incidentally been referred to under No 1 and No 2. They are a very
extensive class. The oldest example is that of Samson's riddle, with a
stake of thirty sheets (or shirts) and thirty change of garments:
Judges, xiv, 12 ff. Another from Semitic tradition is what is related of
Solomon and Hiram of Tyre, in Josephus against Apion, i, 17, 18, and
Antiquities, viii, 5. After the manner of Amasis and the [AE]thiopian king
in Plutarch (see p. 13), they send one another riddles, with a heavy
fine for failure,--in this case a pecuniary one. Solomon at first poses
Hiram; then Hiram guesses Solomon's riddles, by the aid of Abdemon (or
the son of Abdemon), and in turn poses Solomon with riddles devised by
Abdemon.[380]

'P['a] gr[:o]nali[dh]hei[dh]i,' Landstad, p. 369, is a contest in
riddles between two brothers (refreshingly original in some parts),
introduced by three stanzas, in which it is agreed that the defeated
party shall forfeit his share of their inheritance: and this the editor
seems to take quite seriously.

Death is the penalty attending defeat in many of these wit-contests.
Odin (Vaf[th]r['u][dh]nism['a]l), jealous of the giant
Vaf[th]r['u][dh]nir's wisdom, wishes to put it to test. He enters the
giant's hall, assuming the name of Gagnr['a][dh]r, and announces the
object of his visit. The giant tells him he shall never go out again
unless he prove the wiser, asks a few questions to see whether he be
worth contending with, and, finding him so, proposes a decisive trial,
with their heads for the stake. Odin now propounds, first, twelve
questions, mostly in cosmogony, and then five relating to the future of
the universe; and all these the giant is perfectly competent to answer.
The very unfair question is then put, What did Odin say in his son's
ear ere Balder mounted the funeral pile? Upon this Vaf[th]r[^u][dh]nir
owns himself vanquished, and we may be sure he was not spared by his
antagonist.

The Hervarar saga contains a story which, in its outlines, approximates
to that of our ballad until we come to the conclusion, where there is no
likeness. King Hei[dh]rekr, after a long career of blood, gave up war and
took to law-making. He chose his twelve wisest men for judges, and
swore, with one hand on the head and the other on the bristles of a huge
hog which he had reared, that no man should do such things that he
should not get justice from these twelve, while any one who preferred
might clear himself by giving the king riddles which he could not guess.
There was a man named Gestr, and surnamed the Blind, a very bad and
troublesome fellow, who had withheld from Hei[dh]rekr tribute that was due.
The king sent him word to come to him and submit to the judgment of the
twelve: if he did not, the case would be tried with arms. Neither of
these courses pleased Gestr, who was conscious of being very guilty: he
took the resolution of making offerings to Odin for help. One night
there was a knock. Gestr went to the door, and saw a man, who announced
his name as Gestr. After mutual inquiries about the news, the stranger
asked whether Gestr the Blind was not in trouble about something. Gestr
the Blind explained his plight fully, and the stranger said, "I will go
to the king and try what I can effect: we will exchange looks and
clothes." The stranger, in the guise of Gestr, entered the king's hall,
and said, Sire, I am come to make my peace. "Will you abide by the
judgment of my men of law?" asked the king. "Are there not other ways?"
inquired Gestr. "Yes: you shall give me riddles which I cannot guess,
and so purchase your peace." Gestr assented, with feigned hesitation;
chairs were brought, and everybody looked to hear something fine. Gestr
gave, and Hei[dh]rekr promptly answered, some thirty riddles.[381] Then
said Gestr: Tell thou me this only, since thou thinkest to be wiser than
all kings: What said Odin in Balder's ear before he was borne to the
pile? "Shame and cowardice," exclaimed Hei[dh]rekr, "and all manner of
poltroonery, jugglery, goblinry! no one knows those words of thine save
thou thyself, evil and wretched wight!" So saying, Hei[dh]rekr drew
Tyrfing, that never was bared but somebody must fall, to cut down Gestr.
The disguised Odin changed to a hawk, and made for the window, but did
not escape before Hei[dh]rekr's sword had docked the bird's tail. For
breaking his own truce Odin said Hei[dh]rekr should die by the hand of a
slave, which came to pass. Fornaldar S[:o]gur, Rafn, I, 462 ff.

The same story has come down in a F[:a]r[:o]e ballad, 'G['a]tu
r['i]ma,' Hammershaimb, F[ae]r[:o]iske Kv[ae]der, No 4, p. 26 (and
previously published in the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1849-51, pp 75-78),
translated by Dr Prior, I, 336 ff. Gest promises Odin twelve gold marks
to take his place. The riddles are announced as thirteen in number, but
the ballad is slightly defective, and among others the last question,
What were Odin's words to Balder? is lost. Odin flies off in the shape
of a falcon; Hejdrek and all his men are burned up.

A tale presenting the essential traits of our ballad is cited in Vincent
of Beauvais's Speculum Morale, i, 4, 10, at the end. We read, he says,
of a king, who, seeking a handle for wrenching money out of a wealthy
and wise man, put him three questions, apparently insoluble, intending
to make him pay a large sum for not answering them: 1, Where is the
middle point of the earth? 2, How much water is there in the sea? 3, How
great is the mercy of God? On the appointed day, having been brought
from prison into the presence to ransom himself if he could, the
respondent, by the _advice of a certain philosopher_, proceeded thus. He
planted his staff where he stood, and said, Here is the centre; disprove
it if you can. If you wish me to measure the sea, stop the rivers, so
that nothing may flow in till I have done; then I will give you the
contents. To answer your third question, I must borrow your robes and
your throne. Then mounting the throne, clothed with the royal insignia,
"Behold," said he, "the height of the mercy of God: but now I was a
slave, now I am a king; but now poor, and now rich; but now in prison
and in chains, and now at liberty," etc.

Of the same stamp is a story in the English Gesta Romanorum, Madden, p.
55, No 19. A knight was accused to the emperor by his enemies, but not
so as to give a plausible ground for steps against him. The emperor
could hit upon no way but to put him questions, on pain of life and
death. The questions were seven; the third and the sixth will suffice:
How many gallons of salt water been in the sea? Answer: Let all the
outpassings of fresh water be stopped, and I shall tell thee. How many
days' journey beth in the circle of the world? Answer: Only the space of
one day.

Much nearer to the ballad, and earlier than either of the preceding,
is the Stricker's tale of [^A]m[^i]s and the Bishop, in the Pfaffe
[^A]m[^i]s, dated at about 1236. [^A]m[^i]s, a learned and bountiful
priest in England, excited the envy of his bishop, who sent for him,
told him that he lived in better style than his superior, and demanded
a subvention. The priest flatly refused to give the bishop anything
but a good dinner. "Then you shall lose your church," said the bishop
in wrath. But the priest, strong in a good conscience, felt small
concern about that: he said the bishop might test his fitness with any
examination he pleased. That I will do, said the bishop, and gave him
five questions. "How much is there in the sea?" "One tun," answered
[^A]m[^i]s; "and if you think I am not right, stop all the rivers that
flow in, and I will measure it and convince you." "Let the rivers run,"
said the bishop. "How many days from Adam to our time?" "Seven," said
the parson; "for as soon as seven are gone, they begin again." The
bishop, fast losing his temper, next demanded "What is the exact middle
of the earth? Tell me, or lose your church." "Why, my church stands on
it," replied [^A]m[^i]s. "Let your men measure, and take the church if
it prove not so." The bishop declined the task, and asked once more:
How far is it from earth to sky? and then: What is the width of the
sky? to which [^A]m[^i]s replied after the same fashion.

In this tale of the Stricker the parson answers for himself, and not by
deputy, and none of the questions are those of our ballad. But in a tale
of Franco Sacchetti,[382] given in two forms, Novella iv^a, we have both
the abbot and his humble representative, and an agreement as to one of
the questions. Bernab[o'] Visconti ([+] 1385) was offended with a rich
abbot, who had neglected some dogs that had been entrusted to his care,
and was minded to make the abbot pay him a fine; but so far yielded to
the abbot's protest as to promise to release him from all penalties if
he could answer four questions: How far is it from here to heaven? How
much water is there in the sea? What is going on in hell? What is the
value of my person? A day was given to get up the answers. The abbot
went home, in the depths of melancholy, and met on the way one of his
millers, who inquired what was the matter, and, after receiving an
explanation, offered to take the abbot's place, disguising himself as
well as he could. The answers to the two first questions are not the
usual ones: huge numbers are given, and the seigneur is told to measure
for himself, if not willing to accept them. The answer to the fourth is
twenty-nine deniers; for our Lord was sold for thirty, and you must be
worth one less than he. Messer Bernab[o'] said the miller should be abbot,
and the abbot miller, from that time forth. Sacchetti says that others
tell the story of a pope and an abbot, adding one question. The gardener
of the monastery presents the abbot, makes the usual answer to the
second question as to the water in the sea, and prizes Christ's vicar at
twenty-eight deniers.

The excellent old farce, "Ein Spil von einem Kaiser und eim Apt,"
Fastnachtspiele aus dem 15^n Jahrhundert, I, 199, No 22, obliges the
abbot to answer three questions, or pay for all the damages done in the
course of a calamitous invasion. The abbot has a week's grace allowed
him. The questions are three: How much water in the sea? How much is the
emperor worth? Whose luck came quickest? The miller answers for the
abbot: Three tubs, if they are big enough; eight and twenty pence; and
_he_ is the man whose luck came quickest, for just before he was a
miller, now he is an abbot. The emperor says that, since the miller has
acted for the abbot, abbot he shall be.

Very like this, as to the form of the story, is the anecdote in Pauli's
Schimpf und Ernst, LV, p. 46, ed. Oesterley (c. 1522). A nobleman, who
is seeking an occasion to quarrel with an abbot, tells him that he must
answer these questions in three days, or be deposed: What do you value
me at? Where is the middle of the world? How far apart are good and bad
luck? A swineherd answers for him: Since Christ was sold for thirty
pence, I rate the emperor at twenty-nine and you at twenty-eight; my
church is the mid-point of the world, and, if you will not believe me,
measure for yourself; good and bad luck are but one night apart, for
yesterday I was a swineherd, to-day I am an abbot. Then, says the
nobleman, an abbot shall you stay. With this agrees, say the Grimms, the
tale in Eyring's Proverbiorum Copia (1601), I, 165-168, III, 23-25.

Waldis, Esopus (1548), B. 3, Fabel 92, Kurz, I, 382, agrees in general
with Pauli: but in place of the first two questions has these three: How
far is to heaven? How deep is the sea? How many tubs will hold all the
sea-water? The answers are: A short day's journey, for Christ ascended
in the morning and was in heaven before night; a stone's cast; one tub,
if large enough.

Teofilo Folengo (1491-1544), as pointed out by K[:o]hler, has the story in
the 8th canto of his Orlandino; and here we find the third question of
our ballad. There are three besides: How far from earth to heaven? From
the east to the west?--a modification of the second question in the
ballad; How many drops of water in the seas about Italy? The abbot's
cook, Marcolf, answers to the first, One leap, as proved by Satan's
fall; to the second, One day's journey, if the sun is to be trusted; and
insists that, for a correct count under the third, all the rivers shall
first be stopped. To the fourth he makes the never-stale reply, You
_think_ I am the abbot, but I am the cook. Rainero says he shall remain
abbot, and the abbot the cook. (Stanzas 38, 39, 64-69, pp 186 f, 195 ff,
London edition of 1775.)

A capital Spanish story, 'Gramatica Parda, Trueba, Cuentos Populares, p.
287, has all three of the questions asked and answered as in our ballad.
There is a curate who sets up to know everything, and the king, "el rey
que rabi['o]," has found him out, and gives him a month to make his three
answers, with a premium and a penalty. The curate is forced to call in a
despised goatherd, who also had all along seen through the shallowness
of the priest. The king makes the goatherd "archip['a]mpano" of Seville,
and condemns the curate to wear the herdsman's garb and tend his goats
for a month.[383]

The first and third questions of the ballad are found in the
thirty-eighth tale of Le Grand Parangon des Nouvelles Nouvelles of
Nicolas de Troyes, 1536 (ed. Mabille, p. 155 ff); in the Patra[~n]uelo of
Juan de Timoneda, 1576, Pat. 14, Novelistas anteriores ['a] Cervantes, in
the Rivadeneyra Biblioteca, p. 154 f; and in the Herzog Heinrich Julius
von Braunschweig's comedy, Von einem Edelman welcher einem Abt drey
Fragen auffgegeben, 1594, ed. Holland, p. 500 ff. The other question is
as to the centre of the earth, and the usual answers are given by the
abbot's miller, cook, servant, except that in Timoneda the cook is so
rational as to say that the centre must be under the king's feet, seeing
that the world is as round as a ball.[384] The question Where is the
middle of the earth? is replaced by How many stars are there in the sky?
the other two remaining, in Balthasar Schupp, Schriften, Franckfurt,
1701, I, 91 f (K[:o]hler), and in Gottlieb Cober ([+] 1717),
Cabinet-prediger, 2^r Theil, No 65, p. 323 (Gr[:a]ter, Idunna u. Hermode,
1814, No 33, p. 131, and p. 87). The abbot's miller gives a huge number,
and bids the king (of France) verify it, if he wishes. This last is no
doubt the version of the story referred to by the Grimms in their note
to K. u. H. m[:a]rchen, No 152.

We encounter a slight variation, not for the better, in L'['E]lite des
Contes du Sieur d'Ouville ([+] 1656 or 1657), Rouen, 1699, I, 241; [a'] la
Haye, 1703, I, 296; ed. Ristelhuber, 1876, p. 46 (K[:o]hler); Nouveaux
Contes [a'] Rire, Cologne, 1709, p. 266; Contes [a'] Rire, Paris, 1781, I,
184. An ignorant and violent nobleman threatens a parson, who plumes
himself on a little astrology, that he will expose him as an impostor if
he does not answer four questions: Where is the middle of the world?
What am I worth? What am I thinking? What do I believe? The village
miller answers for the cur['e]. The reply to the third question is, You are
thinking more of your own interest than of mine; the others as before.
This story is retold, after tradition, by C['e]nac Moncaut, Contes
populaires de la Gascogne, p. 50, of a marquis, archipr[^e]tre, and miller.
The query, What am I thinking of? with the answer, More of your interest
than of mine (which is not exactly in the popular manner), is replaced
by a logical puzzle, not found elsewhere: Quel est le nombre qui se
trouve renferm['e] dans deux [oeufs]?

The King and the Abbot is preserved, in modern German tradition, in this
form. An emperor, riding by a cloister, reads the inscription, We are
two farthings poorer than the emperor, and live free of cares. Wait a
bit, says the emperor, and I will give you some cares. He sends for the
abbot, and says, Answer these three questions in three days, or I will
depose you. The questions are, How deep is the sea? How many stars in
the sky? How far from good luck to bad? The shepherd of the monastery
gives the answers, and is told, as in several cases before, If you are
the abbot, abbot you shall be. J. W. Wolf, Hessische Sagen, p. 166, No
262, II. 'Gustav Adolf und der Abt von Benediktbeuern,' in Sepp's
Altbayerischer Sagenschatz, p. 554, No 153, is another form of the same
story, with a substitution of How far is it to heaven? for the first
question, and the answers are given by a kitchie-boy.[385] In 'Hans ohne
Sorgen,' Meier, Deutsche Volksm[:a]rchen aus Schwaben, p. 305, the
questions are, How far is it to heaven? How deep is the sea? How many
leaves has a linden? and the shepherd again undertakes the
answers.[386] 'Der M[:u]ller ohne Sorgen,' M[:u]llenhoff, p. 153, 208, is a
mutilated variation of these. The abbot disappears, and the questions
are put to the miller, who answers for himself. The second question is
How much does the moon weigh? and the answer, Four quarters; if you
don't believe it, you must weigh for yourself.

We meet the miller _sans souci_ again in a Danish tale, which otherwise
agrees entirely with our ballad. The questions are answered by the rich
miller's herdsman: Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder, 1854, p. 112, No 111.

A Croatian version of the story is given by Valyavets, 'Frater i turski
car,' p. 262. The Turkish tsar is disposed to expel all monks from his
dominions, but determines first to send for an abbot to try his calibre.
The abbot is too much frightened to go, and his cook, as in Foligno and
Timoneda, takes his place. The questions are, Where is the centre of the
world? What is God doing now? What am I thinking? The first and third
are disposed of in the usual way. When called to answer the second, the
cook said, You can't see through the ceiling: we must go out into the
field. When they came to the field, the cook said again, How can I see
when I am on such a small ass? Let me have your horse. The sultan
consented to exchange beasts, and then the cook said, God is wondering
that a sultan should be sitting on an ass and a monk on a horse. The
sultan was pleased with the answers, and reasoning, If the cook is so
clever, what must the abbot be, decided to let the monks alone.
Afanasief, who cites this story from Valyavets (Narodnuiya russkiya
Skazki, VIII, 460), says that he heard in the government of Voroneje a
story of a soldier who dressed himself as a monk and presented himself
before a tsar who was in the habit of puzzling people with riddles. The
questions are, How many drops in the sea? How many stars in the sky?
What do I think? And the answer to the last is, Thou thinkest, gosudar,
that I am a monk, but I am merely a soldier.[387]

A few tales, out of many remaining, may be now briefly mentioned, on
account of variations in the setting.

A prisoner is to be released if he can tell a queen how much she is
worth, the centre of the world, and what she thinks. A peasant changes
clothes with the prisoner, and answers _pro more_. Kurtzweiliger
Zeitvertreiber durch C. A. M. von W., 1668, p. 70 f, in K[:o]hler, Orient
u. Occident, I, 43.

A scholar has done learning. His master says he must now answer three
questions, or have his head taken off. The master's brother, a miller,
comes to his aid. The questions are, How many ladders would reach to the
sky? Where is the middle of the world? What is the world worth? Or,
according to another tradition, the two last are, How long will it take
to go round the world? What is my thought? Campbell, Popular Tales of
the West Highlands, II, 391 f.

Eulenspiegel went to Prague, and advertised himself on the doors of the
churches and lecture-rooms as a great master, capable of answering
questions that nobody else could solve. To put him down, the rector and
his colleagues summoned Eulenspiegel to an examination before the
university. Five questions were given him: How much water is there in
the sea? How many days from Adam to now? Where is the middle of the
world? How far from earth to heaven? What is the breadth of the sky?
Lappenberg, Dr Thomas Murners Ulenspiegel, p. 38, No 28; Howleglas, ed.
Ouvry, p. 28.

A herdboy had a great fame for his shrewd answers. The king did not
believe in him, but sent for him, and said, If you can answer three
questions that I shall put, I will regard you as my own child, and you
shall live in my palace. The questions are, How many drops of water are
there in the ocean? How many stars in the sky? How many seconds in
eternity? The Grimms, K. u. H. m[:a]rchen, No 152, 'Das Hirtenb[:u]blein.'

Three questions are put to a counsellor of the king's, of which the
first two are, Where does the sun rise? How far from heaven to earth?
The answers, by a shepherd, are extraordinarily feeble. J[:u]disches
Maas[:a]buch, cap. 126, cited from Helwigs J[:u]dische Historien, No 39, in
the Grimms' note to Das Hirtenb[:u]blein.

Three monks, who know everything, in the course of their travels come to
a sultan's dominions, and he invites them to turn Mussulmans. This they
agree to do if he will answer their questions. All the sultan's doctors
are convened, but can do nothing with the monks' questions. The hodja
(the court-fool) is sent for. The first question, Where is the middle of
the earth? is answered as usual. The second monk asks, How many stars
are there in the sky? The answer is, As many as there are hairs on my
ass. Have you counted? ask the monks. Have _you_ counted? rejoins the
fool. Answer me this, says the same monk, and we shall see if your
number is right: How many hairs are there in my beard? "As many as in my
ass's tail." "Prove it." "My dear man, if you don't believe me, count
yourself; or we will pull all the hairs out of both, count them, and
settle the matter." The monks submit, and become Mussulmans. Les
plaisanteries de Nasr-eddin Hodja, traduites du turc par J. A.
Decourdemanche, No 70, p. 59 ff.

The Turkish emperor sends word to Kaiser Leopold that unless the emperor
can answer three questions he shall come down upon him with all his
Turks. The counsellors are summoned, but there is no help in them. The
court-fool offers to get his master out of the difficulty, if he may
have the loan of crown and sceptre. When the fool comes to
Constantinople, there lies the sultan in the window, and calls out, Are
you the emperor, and will you answer my questions? Where does the world
end? "Here, where my horse is standing." How far is it to heaven? "One
day's journey, and no inn on the road." What is God thinking of now? "He
is thinking that I am one fool and you another." J. W. Wolf, Hessische
Sagen, p. 165, No 262I.[388]

    A hundred men euen, as I [have heard] say,
    The bishopp kept in his house eu_er_ye day,
    And fifty gold chaines, w_i_thout any doubt,
    In veluett coates waited the bishopp about.

    4
    The bishopp, he came to the court anon,
    Before his prince _tha_t was called K_ing_ Iohn.
    As soone as the bishopp the k_ing_ did see,
    'O,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'bishopp, thow art welcome to mee.
    There is noe man soe welcome to towne
    As thou _tha_t workes treason against my crowne.'

    5
    'My leege,' q_uo_th the bishopp, 'I wold it were knowne
    I spend, yo_u_r grace, nothing but _tha_t _tha_t's my owne;
    I trust yo_u_r grace will doe me noe deare
    For spending my owne trew gotten geere.'

    6
    'Yes,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'bishopp, thou must needs dye,
    Eccept thou can answere mee questions three;
    Thy head shalbe smitten quite from thy bodye,
    And all thy liuing remayne vnto mee.

    7
    'First,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'tell me in this steade,
    W_i_th this crowne of gold heere vpon my head,
    Amongst my nobilitye, w_i_th ioy and much mirth,
    Lett me know w_i_thin one pennye what I am worth.

    8
    'Secondlye, tell me without any dowbt
    How soone I may goe the whole world about;
    And thirdly, tell mee or eu_er_ I stinte,
    What is the thing, bishopp, _tha_t I doe thinke.
    Twenty dayes pardon thoust haue trulye,
    And come againe and answere mee.'

    9
    The bishopp bade the k_ing_ god night att a word;
    He rode betwixt Cambridge and Oxenford,
    But neu_er_ a doctor there was soe wise
    Cold shew him these questions or enterprise.

    10
    Wherew_i_th the bishopp was nothing gladd,
    But in his hart was heauy and sadd,
    And hyed him home to a house in the countrye,
    To ease some p_ar_t of his melanchollye.

    11
    His halfe-brother dwelt there, was feirce and fell,
    Noe better but a shepard to the bishoppe himsell;
    The shepard came to the bishopp anon,
    Saying, My Lord, you are welcome home!

    12
    'What ayles you,' q_uo_th the shepard,' _tha_t you are soe sadd,
    And had wonte to haue beene soe merry and gladd?'
    'Nothing,' q_uo_th the bishopp, 'I ayle att this time;
    Will not thee availe to know, brother mine.'

    13
    'Brother,' q_uo_th the shepeard, 'you haue heard itt,
    _Tha_t a ffoole may teach a wisemane witt;
    Say me therfore whatsoeu_er_ you will,
    And if I doe you noe good, Ile doe you noe ill.'

    14
    Q_uo_th the bishop: I haue beene att the court anon,
    Before my prince is called K_ing_ Iohn,
    And there he hath charged mee
    Against his crowne with traitorye.

    15
    If I cannott answer his misterye,
    Three questions hee hath p_ro_pounded to mee,
    He will haue my land soe faire and free,
    And alsoe the head from my bodye.

    16
    The first question was, to tell him in _tha_t stead,
    W_i_th the crowne of gold vpon his head,
    Amongst his nobilitye, w_i_th ioy and much mirth,
    To lett him know w_i_thin one penye what hee is worth.

    17
    And secondlye, to tell him w_i_th-out any doubt
    How soone he may goe the whole world about;
    And thirdlye, to tell him, or ere I stint,
    What is the thinge _tha_t he does thinke.

    18
    'Brother,' q_uo_th the shepard, 'you are a man of learninge;
    What neede you stand in doubt of soe small a thinge?
    Lend me,' q_uo_th the shepard, 'yo_u_r ministers apparrell,
    Ile ryde to the court and answere yo_u_r quarrell.

    19
    'Lend me yo_u_r serving men, say me not nay,
    W_i_th all yo_u_r best horsses _tha_t ryd on the way;
    Ile to the court, this matter to stay;
    Ile speake w_i_th K_ing_ Iohn and heare what heele say.'

    20
    The bishopp w_i_th speed p_re_pared then
    To sett forth the shepard with horsse and man;
    The shepard was liuely w_i_thout any doubt;
    I wott a royall companye came to the court.

    21
    The shepard hee came to the court anon
    Before [his] prince _tha_t was called K_ing_ Iohn.
    As soone as the k_ing_ the shepard did see,
    'O,' q_uo_th the king, 'bishopp, thou art welcome to me.'
    The shepard was soe like the bishopp his brother,
    The k_ing_ cold not know the one from the other.

    22
    Q_uo_th the k_ing_, Bishopp, thou art welcome to me
    If thou can answer me my questions three.
    Said the shepeard, If it please yo_u_r grace,
    Show mee what the first quest[i]on was.

    23
    'First,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'tell mee in this stead,
    W_i_th the crowne of gold vpon my head,
    Amongst my nobilitye, w_i_th ioy and much mirth,
    W_i_thin one pennye what I am worth.'

    24
    Q_uo_th the shepard, To make yo_u_r grace noe offence,
    I thinke you are worth nine and twenty pence;
    For our L_ord_ Iesus, _tha_t bought vs all,
    For thirty pence was sold into thrall
    Amongst the cursed Iewes, as I to you doe showe;
    But I know Christ was one penye better then you.

    25
    Then the k_ing_ laught, and swore by St Andrew
    He was not thought to bee of such a small value.
    'Secondlye, tell mee w_i_th-out any doubt
    How soone I may goe the world round about.'

    26
    Saies the shepard, It is noe time with yo_u_r grace to scorne,
    But rise betime w_i_th the sun in the morne,
    And follow his course till his vprising,
    And then you may know w_i_thout any leasing.

    27
    And this [to] yo_u_r grace shall proue the same,
    You are come to the same place from whence you came;
    [In] twenty-four houres, w_i_th-out any doubt,
    Yo_u_r grace may the world goe round about;
    The world round about, euen as I doe say,
    If w_i_th the sun you can goe the next way.

    28
    'And thirdlye tell me or eu_er_ I stint,
    What is the thing, bishoppe, _tha_t I doe thinke.'
    '_Tha_t shall I doe,' q_uo_th the shepeard; 'for veretye,
    You thinke I am the bishopp of Canterburye.'

    29
    'Why, art not thou? the truth tell to me;
    For I doe thinke soe,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'by St Marye.'
    'Not soe,' q_uo_th the shepeard; 'the truth shalbe knowne,
    I am his poore shepeard; my brother is att home.'

    30
    'Why,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'if itt soe bee,
    Ile make thee bishopp here to mee.'
    'Noe, Sir,' q_uo_th the shepard, 'I pray you be still,
    For Ile not bee bishop but against my will;
    For I am not fitt for any such deede,
    For I can neither write nor reede.'

    31
    'Why then,' q_uo_th the k_ing_, 'Ile giue thee cleere
    A pattent of three hundred pound a yeere;
    _Tha_t I will giue thee franke and free;
    Take thee _tha_t, shepard, for coming to me.

    32
    'Free p_ar_don Ile giue,' the k_ing_s grace said,
    'To saue the bishopp, his land and his head;
    W_i_th him nor thee Ile be nothing wrath;
    Here is the p_ar_don for him and thee both.'

    33
    Then the shepard he had noe more to say,
    But tooke the p_ar_don and rode his way:
    When he came to the bishopps place,
    The bishopp asket anon how all things was.

    34
    'Brother,' q_uo_th the shepard, 'I haue well sped,
    For I haue saued both yo_u_r land and yo_u_r head;
    The k_ing_ with you is nothing wrath,
    For heere is the p_ar_don for you and mee both.'

    35
    Then the bishopes hart was of a merry cheere:
    'Brother, thy paines Ile quitt them cleare;
    For I will giue thee a patent to thee and to thine
    Of fifty pound a yeere, land good and fine.'

    36
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    'I will to thee noe longer croche nor creepe,
    Nor Ile serue thee noe more to keepe thy sheepe.'

    37
    Whereeu_er_ wist you shepard before,
    _Tha_t had in his head witt such store
    To pleasure a bishopp in such a like case,
    To answer three questions to the k_ing_s grace?
    Whereeu_er_ wist you shepard gett cleare
    Three hundred and fifty pound a yeere?

    38
    I neu_er_ hard of his fellow before,
    Nor I neu_er_ shall: now I need to say noe more.
    I neu_er_ knew shepeard _tha_t gott such a liuinge
    But David, the shepeard, _tha_t was a k_ing_.

        Pye-corner (1672-95).

    1
    I'll tell you a story, a story anon,
    Of a noble prince, and his name was King John;
    For he was a prince, and a prince of great might,
    He held up great wrongs, he put down great right.
      Derry down, down hey, derry down

    2
    I'll tell you a story, a story so merry,
    Concerning the Abbot of Canterbury,
    And of his house-keeping and high renown,
    Which made him resort to fair London town.

    3
    'How now, father abbot? 'T is told unto me
    That thou keepest a far better house than I;
    And for [thy] house-keeping and high renown,
    I fear thou has treason against my crown.'

    4
    'I hope, my liege, that you owe me no grudge
    For spending of my true-gotten goods:'
    'If thou dost not answer me questions three,
    Thy head shall be taken from thy body.

    5
    'When I am set so high on my steed,
    With my crown of gold upon my head,
    Amongst all my nobility, with joy and much mirth,
    Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worth.

    6
    'And the next question you must not flout,
    How long I shall be riding the world about;
    And the third question thou must not shrink,
    But tell to me truly what I do think.'

    7
    'O these are hard questions for my shallow wit,
    For I cannot answer your grace as yet;
    But if you will give me but three days space,
    I'll do my endeavor to answer your grace.'

    8
    'O three days space I will thee give,
    For that is the longest day thou hast to live.
    And if thou dost not answer these questions right,
    Thy head shall be taken from thy body quite.'

    9
    And as the shepherd was going to his fold,
    He spy'd the old abbot come riding along:
    'How now, master abbot? You'r welcome home;
    What news have you brought from good King John?'

    10
    'Sad news, sad news I have thee to give,
    For I have but three days space for to live;
    If I do not answer him questions three,
    My head will be taken from my body.

    11
    'When he is set so high on his steed,
    With his crown of gold upon his head,
    Amongst all his nobility, with joy and much mirth,
    I must tell him to one penny what he is worth.

    12
    'And the next question I must not flout,
    How long he shall be riding the world about;
    And the third question I must not shrink,
    But tell him truly what he does think.'

    13
    'O master, did you never hear it yet,
    That a fool may learn a wiseman wit?
    Lend me but your horse and your apparel,
    I'll ride to fair London and answer the quarrel.'

    14
    'Now I am set so high on my steed,
    With my crown of gold upon my head,
    Amongst all my nobility, with joy and much mirth,
    Now tell me to one penny what I am worth.'

    15
    'For thirty pence our Saviour was sold,
    Amongst the false Jews, as you have been told,
    And nine and twenty's the worth of thee,
    For I think thou are one penny worser than he.'

    16
    'And the next question thou mayst not flout;
    How long I shall be riding the world about.'
    'You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,
    Until the next morning he rises again,
    And then I am sure you will make no doubt
    But in twenty-four hours you'l ride it about.'

    17
    'And the third question you must not shrink,
    But tell me truly what I do think.'
    'All that I can do, and 't will make you merry;
    For you think I'm the Abbot of Canterbury,
    But I'm his poor shepherd, as you may see,
    And am come to beg pardon for he and for me.'

    18
    The king he turned him about and did smile,
    Saying, Thou shalt be the abbot the other while:
    'O no, my grace, there is no such need,
    For I can neither write nor read.'

    19
    'Then four pounds a week will I give unto thee
    For this merry jest thou hast told unto me;
    And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home,
    Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.'

[380] This story serves as a gloss on 2 Chronicles, ii, 13, 14, where
Hiram sends Solomon a cunning Tyrian, skilful to find out every device
which shall be put to him by the cunning men of Jerusalem. The Queen of
Sheba's hard questions to Solomon, not specified in 1 Kings, x, 1-13,
were, according to tradition, of the same general character as the
Indian ones spoken of at p. 12. See Hertz, Die R[:a]tsel der K[:o]nigin von
Saba, Zeitschrift f[:u]r deutsches Altertum, XXVII, 1 ff.

[381] These are proper riddles, and of a kind still current in popular
tradition. See, e. g., Svend Vonved, Grundtvig, I, 237 f. There are
thirty-five, before the last, in the oldest text, given, with a
translation, by Vigfusson and Powell, Corpus Poeticum Boreale, 'King

[383] The form of the third question is slightly varied at first [?]Cu['a]l
es el error en que yo estoy pensando? But when put to the herdsman the
question is simply [?]En qu['e] estoy yo pensando? I was pointed to this
story by Seidemann, in Archiv f[:u]r Litteraturgeschichte, IX, 423.

[384] The editor of the Grand Parangon, at p. xiii, cites from an older
source an anecdote of a king insisting upon being told how much he ought
to bring if offered for sale. While his courtiers are giving flattering
replies, a fool leaps forward and says, Twenty-nine deniers, and no
more; for if you were worth thirty, that would be autant que le
tout-puissant Dieu valut, quant il fut vendu. The king took this answer
to heart, and repented of his vanities. So an emperor is converted by
this reply from a man-at-arms, Van den verwenden Keyser, Jan van
Hollant, c. 1400, Willems, Belgisch Museum, X, 57; Thijm, p. 145. The
like question and answer, as a riddle, in a German MS. of the fifteenth
century, and in Questions ['e]nigmatiques, Lyon, 1619; K[:o]hler, in
Weimarisches Jahrbuch, V, 354 ff.

[385] In Prussia Frederick the Great plays the part of Gustavus. Sepp,
p. 558.

[386] Another Swabian story, in Meier, No 28, p. 99, is a mixed form.
The Duke of Swabia reads "Hans sans cares" over a miller's house-door,
and says, "Bide a wee: if you have no cares, I will give you some." The
duke, to give the miller a taste of what care is, says he must solve
this riddle or lose his mill: Come to me neither by day nor by night,
neither naked nor clothed, neither on foot nor on horseback. The miller
promises his man his daughter in marriage and the mill in succession,
if he will help him out of his dilemma. The man at once says, Go on
Mid-week, for Mid-week is no day (Mitt-woch ist ja gar kein Tag, wie
Sonn-tag, Mon-tag), neither is it night; and if you are to be neither
clothed nor bare, put on a fishing-net; and if you are to go neither
on foot nor on horseback, ride to him on an ass. All but the beginning
of this is derived from the cycle of 'The Clever Wench:' see No 2.
Haltrich, Deutsche Volksm[:a]rchen in Siebenb[:u]rgen, No 45, which
is also of this cycle, has taken up a little of 'Hans ohne Sorgen.' A
church has an inscription, Wir leben ohne Sorgen. This vexes the king,
who says as before, Just wait, and I will give you reason for cares, p.
244, ed. 1856.

[387] These two stories were communicated to me by Mr Ralston.

[388] In the beginning there is a clear trace of the Oriental tales of
'The Clever Lass' cycle.

A copy of this ballad was printed in The New British Songster, a
Collection of Songs, Scots and English, with Toasts and Sentiments for
the Bottle, Falkirk, 1785: see Motherwell, p. lxxiv.[389] Few were more
popular, says Motherwell, and Jamieson remarks that 'Captain
Wedderburn' was equally in vogue in the north and the south of Scotland.

Jamieson writes to the Scots Magazine, 1803, p. 701: "Of this ballad I
have got one whole copy and part of another, and I remember a good deal
of it as I have heard it sung in Morayshire when I was a child." In his
Popular Ballads, II, 154, 1806, he says that the copy which he prints
was furnished him from Mr Herd's MS. by the editor of the Border
Minstrelsy, and that he had himself supplied a few readings of small
importance from his own recollection. There is some inaccuracy here. The
version given by Jamieson is rather #B#, with readings from #A#.

'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship,' or 'Lord Roslin's Daughter,'[392] is a
counterpart of the ballad in which a maid wins a husband by guessing
riddles. (See Nos 1 and 2, and also the following ballad, for a lady who
_gives_ riddles.) The ingenious suitor, though not so favorite a
subject as the clever maid, may boast that he is of an old and
celebrated family. We find him in the Gesta Romanorum, No 70; Oesterley,
p. 383, Madden's English Versions, No 35, p. 384. A king had a beautiful
daughter, whom he wished to dispose of in marriage; but she had made a
vow that she would accept no husband who had not achieved three tasks:
to tell her how many feet long, broad, and deep were the four elements;
to change the wind from the north; to take fire into his bosom, next the
flesh, without harm. The king issued a proclamation in accordance with
these terms. Many tried and failed, but at last there came a soldier who
succeeded. To answer the first question he made his servant lie down,
and measured him from head to foot. Every living being is composed of
the four elements, he said, and I find not more than seven feet in them.
A very easy way was hit on for performing the second task: the soldier
simply turned his horse's head to the east, and, since wind is the life
of every animal, maintained that he had changed the wind. The king was
evidently not inclined to be strict, and said, Clear enough. Let us go
on to the third. Then, by the aid of a stone which he always carried
about him, the soldier put handfuls of burning coals into his bosom
without injury. The king gave his daughter to the soldier.

An extraordinary ballad in Sakellarios's [Gk: _Kypriaka_] III, 15, No 6,
'The Hundred Sayings,' subjects a lover to a severe probation of
riddles. (Liebrecht has given a full abstract of the story in Gosche's
Archiv, II, 29.) A youth is madly enamored of a king's daughter, but,
though his devotion knows no bound, cannot for a long time get a word
from her mouth, and then only disdain. She shuts herself up in a tower.
He prays for a heat that may force her to come to the window, and that
she may drop her spindle, and he be the only one to bring it to her. The
heavens are kind: all this comes to pass, and she is fain to beg him to
bring her the spindle. She asks, Can you do what I say? Shoulder a
tower? make a stack of eggs? trim a date-tree, standing in a great
river?[393] All this he can do. She sends him away once and again to
learn various things; last of all, the hundred sayings that lovers use.
He presents himself for examination. "One?" "There is one only God: may
he help me!" "Two?" "Two doves with silver wings are sporting together:
I saw how they kissed," etc. "Three?" "Holy Trinity, help me to love the
maid!" "Four?" "There is a four-pointed cross on thy smock, and it
implores God I may be thy mate:" and so he is catechised through all the
units and tens.[394] Then the lady suddenly turns about, concedes
everything, and proposes that they shall go to church: but the man says,
If I am to marry all my loves, I have one in every town, and wife and
children in Constantinople. They part with reciprocal scurrilities.

Usually when the hand of a princess is to be won by the performance of
tasks, whether requiring wit, courage, the overcoming of magic arts, or
what not, the loss of your head is the penalty of failure. (See the
preface to the following ballad.) Apollonius of Tyre, of Greek original,
but first found in a Latin form, is perhaps the oldest riddle-story of
this description. Though its age has not been determined, the tale has
been carried back even to the end of the third or the beginning of the
fourth century, was a great favorite with the Middle Ages, and is kept
only too familiar by the play of Pericles.

More deserving of perpetuation is the charming Persian story of Prince
Calaf, in P['e]tis de La Croix's 1001 Days (45^e-82^e jour), upon which
Carlo Gozzi founded his play of "La Turandot," now best known through
Schiller's translation. Tourandocte's riddles are such as we should call
legitimate, and are three in number. "What is the being that is found in
every land, is dear to all the world, and cannot endure a fellow?" Calaf
answers, The sun. "What mother swallows the children she has given birth
to, as soon as they have attained their growth?" The sea, says Calaf,
for the rivers that flow into it all came from it. "What is the tree
that has all its leaves white on one side and black on the other?" This
tree, Calaf answers, is the year, which is made up of days and
nights.[395]

A third example of this hazardous wooing is the story of The Fair One of
the Castle, the fourth in the Persian poem of The Seven Figures (or
Beauties), by Nisami of Gendsch ([+] 1180). A Russian princess is shut
up in a castle made inaccessible by a talisman, and every suitor must
satisfy four conditions: he must be a man of honor, vanquish the
enchanted guards, take away the talisman, and obtain the consent of her
father. Many had essayed their fortune, and their heads were now arrayed
on the pinnacles of the castle.[396] A young prince had fulfilled the
first three conditions, but the father would not approve his suit until
he had solved the princess's riddles. These are expressed symbolically,
and answered in the same way. The princess sends the prince two pearls
from her earring: he at once takes her meaning,--life is like two drops
of water,--and returns the pearls with three diamonds, to signify that
joy--faith, hope, and love--can prolong life. The princess now sends him
three jewels in a box, with sugar. The prince seizes the idea,--life is
blended with sensuous desire,--and pours milk on the sugar, to intimate
that as milk dissolves sugar, so sensuous desire is quenched by true
love. After four such interchanges, the princess seals her consent with
a device not less elegant than the others.[397]

A popular tale of this class is current in Russia, with this variation:
that the hard-hearted princess requires her lovers to give her riddles,
and those who cannot pose her lose their heads. Foolish Iv['a]n, the
youngest of three brothers, adventures after many have failed. On his
way to the trial he sees a horse in a cornfield and drives it out with a
whip, and further on kills a snake with a lance, saying in each case,
Here's a riddle! Confronted with the princess, he says to her, As I came
to you, I saw by the roadside what was good; and in the good was good;
so I set to work, and with what was good I drove the good from the good.
The good fled from the good out of the good. The princess pleads a
headache, and puts off her answer till the next day, when Iv['a]n gives her
his second enigma: As I came to you, I saw on the way what was bad, and
I struck the bad with a bad thing, and of what was bad the bad died. The
princess, unable to solve these puzzles, is obliged to accept foolish
Iv['a]n. (Afanasief, Skazki, II, 225 ff, No 20, in Ralston's Songs of the
Russian People, p. 354 f.) Closely related to this tale, and still
nearer to one another, are the Grimms' No 22, 'Das R[:a]thsel' (see, also,
the note in their third volume), and the West Highland story, 'The
Ridere (Knight) of Riddles,' Campbell, No 22, II, 27. In the former, as
in the Russian tale, it is the princess that must be puzzled before she
will yield her hand; in the latter, an unmatchable beauty is to be had
by no man who does not put a question which her father cannot solve.

Here may be put three drolleries, all clearly of the same origin, in
which a fool wins a princess by nonplussing her: 'The Three Questions,'
Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, p. 32; a "schwank" of the
fourteenth century, by Heinz der Kellner, von der Hagen's
Gesammtabenteuer, No 63, III, 179 (there very improperly called
Turandot); 'Spurningen,' Asbj[/o]rnson og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 4,
Dasent, Popular Tales from the Norse, p. 148. According to the first of
these, the king of the East Angles promises his clever daughter to any
one who can answer three of her questions (in the other versions, more
correctly, _silence_ her). Three brothers, one of them a natural, set
out for the court, and, on the way, Jack finds successively an egg, a
crooked hazel-stick, and a nut, and each time explodes with laughter.
When they are ushered into the presence, Jack bawls out, What a troop of
fair ladies! "Yes," says the princess, "we are fair ladies, for we carry
fire in our bosoms." "Then roast me an egg," says Jack, pulling out the
egg from his pocket. "How will you get it out again?" asks the princess?
"With a crooked stick," says Jack, producing the same. "Where did that
come from?" says the princess. "From a nut," answers Jack, pulling out
the nut. And so, as the princess is silenced, the fool gets her in
marriage.[398]

Even nowadays riddles play a noteworthy part in the marriages of Russian
peasants. In the government Pskof, as we are informed by Khudyakof, the
bridegroom's party is not admitted into the bride's house until all the
riddles given by the party of the bride have been answered; whence the
saying or proverb, to the behoof of bridegrooms, Choose comrades that
can guess riddles. In the village of Davshina, in the Yaroslav
government, the bridegroom's best man presents himself at the bride's
house on the wedding-day, and finding a man, called the bride-seller,
sitting by the bride, asks him to surrender the bride and vacate his
place. "Fair and softly," answers the seller; "you will not get the
bride for nothing; make us a bid, if you will. And how will you trade?
will you pay in riddles or in gold?" If the best man is prepared for the
emergency, as we must suppose he always would be, he answers, I will pay
in riddles. Half a dozen or more riddles are now put by the seller, of
which these are favorable specimens: Give me the sea, full to the brim,
and with a bottom of silver. The best man makes no answer in words, but
fills a bowl with beer and lays a coin at the bottom. Tell me the thing,
naked itself, which has a shift over its bosom. The best man hands the
seller a candle. Finally the seller says, Give me something which the
master of this house lacks. The best man then brings in the bridegroom.
The seller gives up his seat, and hands the best man a plate, saying,
Put in this what all pretty girls like. The best man puts in what money
he thinks proper, the bridesmaids take it and quit the house, and the
bridegroom's friends carry off the bride.

So, apparently in some ballad, a maid gives riddles, and will marry only
the man who will guess them.

    By day like a hoop,
      By night like a snake;
    Who reads my riddle,
      I take him for mate. (A belt.)

                              No 1103 of Khudyakof.[399]

In Radloff's Songs and Tales of the Turkish tribes in East Siberia, I,
60, a father, wanting a wife for his son, applies to another man, who
has a marriageable daughter. The latter will not make a match unless the
young man's father will come to him with pelt and sans pelt, by the road
and not by the road, on a horse and yet not on a horse: see 8 ff of this
volume. The young man gives his father proper instructions, and wins his
wife.

A Lithuanian mother sends her daughter to the wood to fetch "winter May
and summer snow." She meets a herdsman, and asks where she can find
these. The herdsman offers to teach her these riddles in return for her
love, and she complying with these terms, gives her the answers: The
evergreen tree is winter May, and sea-foam is summer snow. Beitr[:a]ge zur
Kunde Preussens, I, 515 (Rhesa), and Ausland, 1839, p. 1230.

The European tales, excepting the three drolleries (and even they are
perhaps to be regarded only as parodies of the others), must be of
Oriental derivation; but the far north presents us with a similar story
in the lay of Alv['i]ss, in the elder Edda. The dwarf Alv['i]ss comes
to claim Freya for his bride by virtue of a promise from the gods.
Thor[400] says that the bride is in his charge, and that he was from
home when the promise was made: at any rate, Alv['i]ss shall not have
the maid unless he can answer all the questions that shall be put him.
Thor then requires Alv['i]ss to give him the names of earth, heaven,
moon, sun, etc., ending with barley and the poor creature small beer,
in all the worlds; that is, in the dialect of the gods, of mankind,
giants, elves, dwarfs, etc. Alv['i]ss does this with such completeness
as to extort Thor's admiration, but is craftily detained in so doing
till after sunrise, when Thor cries, You are taken in! Above ground at
dawn! and the dwarf turns to stone.

The Minnesinger dames went far beyond our laird's daughter in the way of
requiring "ferlies" from their lovers. Der Tanhuser and Boppe represent
that their ladies would be satisfied with nothing short of their turning
the course of rivers; bringing them the salamander, the basilisk, the
graal, Paris's apple; giving them a sight of Enoch and Elijah in the
body, a hearing of the sirens, etc. Von der Hagen, Minnesinger, II, 91
f, 385 f.

[392] There were, no doubt, Grissels enough in the very distinguished
family of the Sinclairs of Roslin to furnish one for this ballad. I see
two mentioned among the Sinclairs of Herdmanstoun. Even a Wedderburn
connection, as I am informed, is not absolutely lacking. George Home of
Wedderburn ([+] 1497), married the eldest daughter of John Sinclair of
Herdmanstoun: Douglas's Peerage of Scotland, ed. Wood, 1813, II, 174.

[393] The difficulty here is the want of a [Gk: _pou st[^o]_], from which
to climb the tree.

[394] These number-riddles or songs are known to every nation of Europe.
E. g., Chambers' Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 44, ed. 1870, from
Buchan's MSS, I, 280:

    O what will be our ane, boys?
    O what will be our ane, boys?
    My only ane, she walks alane,
    And evermair has dune, boys, etc.

See K[:o]hler in Orient u. Occident, II, 558-9. A dragon, in Hahn's
Griechische u. Albanesische M[:a]rchen, II, 210, gives Penteklimas ten of
these number-riddles: if he answers them he is to have a fine castle; if
not, he is to be eaten. An old woman answers for him: "One is God, two
are the righteous, etc.; ten is your own word, and now burst, dragon!"
The dragon bursts, and Penteklimas inherits his possessions.

[395] Gozzi retains the first and third riddles, Schiller only the
third. By a happy idea, new riddles were introduced at the successive
performances of Schiller's play. Turandot appears as a traditional tale
in Schneller's M[:a]rchen u. Sagen aus W[:a]lschtirol, No 49, p. 132,
"I tre Indovinelli."

[396] The castle with walls and gate thus equipped, or a palisade of
stakes each crowned with a head, is all but a commonplace in such
adventures. This grim stroke of fancy is best in 'La mule sanz frain,'
where there are four hundred stakes, _all but one_ surmounted with a
bloody head: M['e]on, Nouveau Recueil, 1, 15, vv 429-37. For these parlous
princesses, of all sorts, see Grundtvig, 'Den farlige Jomfru,' IV, 43
ff, No 184.

[398] The German schwank affixes the forfeit of the head to failure. In
the Norwegian the unsuccessful brothers get off with a thrashing. The
fire in the English, found also in the German, recalls the third task in
the Gesta Romanorum.

#A# was communicated to Scott "by Mr Hamilton, music-seller, Edinburgh,
with whose mother it had been a favorite." Two stanzas and one line were
wanting, and were supplied by Scott "from a different ballad, having a
plot somewhat similar." The stanzas were 6 and 9. #C# was printed from
the MS., with a few changes, under the title of 'The Bonny Hind Squire,'
by Dixon, in Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 42,
and from Dixon in Bell's Early Ballads, p. 183. Christie, Traditional
Ballad Airs, I, 28, says the ballad was called 'Jolly Janet' by the old
people in Aberdeenshire.

#A-D# are plainly compounded of two ballads, the conclusion being
derived from #E#. The lady's looking oer her castle wa, her putting
riddles, and her having gard so mony die, make the supposition far from
incredible that the Proud Lady Margaret of the first part of the ballad
may originally have been one of the cruel princesses spoken of in the
preface to 'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship,' p. 417. But the corrupt
condition of the texts of #A-D# forbids any confident opinion.

A dead mistress similarly admonishes her lover, in a ballad from
Brittany, given in Amp[e']re, Instructions relatives aux Po['e]sies
populaires de la France, p. 36.

    "Non, je ne dors ni ne soumeille,

    C'est pour vous, Piar', qu'on l'a gard['e]e."

    "Faut point aller aux fileries,

goes into a monastery, where he prays continually that he may see her
again. The devil presents himself in the likeness of a young man, and
on condition of being something gently considered takes him to hell. He
sees his mistress sitting in a fiery chair (cf. #B#, 30, 31), devoured
by serpents night and day, and is informed that fasts and masses on his
part will only make things worse. Like Dives, she sends word to her
sister not to do as she has done. Some of these traits are found also
in one or another of the French versions.

    There was a knight, in a summer's night,
      Appeard in a lady's hall,
    As she was walking up and down,
      Looking oer her castle wall.

    'If that ye dee for me, sir knight,
      Few for you will make meen;
    For mony gude lord's done the same,
      Their graves are growing green.'

    'O winna ye pity me, fair maid,
      O winna ye pity me?
    O winna ye pity a courteous knight,
      Whose love is laid on thee?'

    'Ye say ye are a courteous knight,
      But I think ye are nane;

    Once there was a jolly hind squire
      Appeard in a lady's ha,
    And aye she walked up and down,
      Looking oer her castle wa.

    'What is your wills wi me, kind sir?
      What is your wills wi me?'
    'My wills are [not] sma wi thee, lady,

    'For here I stand a courtier,
      And a courtier come to thee,
    And if ye will not grant me your love,
      For your sake I will die.'

    4
    'If you die for my sake,' she says,
      'Few for you will make moan;
    Many better's died for my sake,
      Their graves are growing green.

    5
    'You appear to be some false young man,

    'An asking, asking, sir,' she said,
      'An asking ye'll grant me:'
    'Ask on, ask on, lady,' he said,
      'What may your asking be?'

    7
    'What's the first thing in flower,' she said,
      'That springs in mire or dale?
    What's the next bird that sings,' she says,
      'Unto the nightingale?
    Or what is the finest thing,' she says,

    'The primrose is the first in flower

      When he is fighting keen.'

    12
    'You may be my match, kind sir,' she said,
      'You may be my match and more;
    There neer was one came such a length

      In the twinkling of an eye,
    Left the lady sorrowful behind,

YOUNG ANDREW

        Percy MS., p. 292. Hales and Furnivall, II, 328.


'Young Andrew' is known only from the Percy manuscript. The story
recalls both 'Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight,' No 4, and 'The Fair
Flower of Northumberland,' No 9. The lady, Helen, 25^3, is bidden to
take, and does take, gold with her in stanzas 5-7, as in No 4, English
#E# 2, 3, #D# 7, Danish #A# 12, #E# 7, 9, #I# 5, #L# 5, 6, and nearly
all the Polish copies, and again in No 9, #A# 14. She is stripped of her
clothes and head-gear in 8-17, as in No 4, English #C-E#, German #G#,
#H#, and many of the Polish versions. These are destined by Young Andrew
for his lady ("that dwells so far in a strange country") in 10, 12, 14,
as by Ulinger for his sister, and by Adelger for his mother, in German
#G# 18, #H# 15. In 15 the lady entreats Young Andrew to leave her her
smock; so in No 4, Polish #L# 8, "You brought me from home in a green
gown; take me back in a shift of tow," and #R# 13, "You took me away in
red satin; let me go back at least in a smock." 18 has the choice
between dying and going home again which is presented in 'Lady Isabel,'
Polish #AA# 4, #H# 10, #R# 11, and implied in 'The Fair Flower of
Northumberland,' #D# 2-5; in #A# 25 of this last the choice is between
dying and being a paramour. In 20, 21, the lady says, "If my father ever
catches you, you're sure to flower a gallows-tree," etc.; in No 4,
Polish #J# 5, "If God would grant me to reach the other bank, you know,
wretch, what death you would die." The father is unrelenting in this
ballad, v. 26, and receives his daughter with severity in 'The Fair
Flower of Northumberland,' #B# 13, #C# 13. The conclusion of 'Young
Andrew' is mutilated and hard to make out. He seems to have been pursued
and caught, as John is in the Polish ballads, #O#, #P#, #T#, etc., of No
4. Why he was not promptly disposed of, and how the wolf comes into the
story, will probably never be known.


    1
    As I was cast in my ffirst sleepe,
      A dreadffull draught in my mind I drew,
    Ffor I was dreamed of a yong man,
      Some men called him yonge Andrew.

    2
    The moone shone bright, and itt cast a ffayre light,
      Sayes shee, Welcome, my honey, my hart, and my sweete!
    For I haue loued thee this seuen long yeere,
      And our chance itt was wee cold neuer meete.

    3
    Then he tooke her in his armes two,
      And kissed her both cheeke and chin,
    And twise or thrise he pleased this may
      Before they tow did p_ar_t in twinn.

    4
    Saies, Now, good s_i_r, you haue had yo_u_r will,
      You can demand no more of mee;
    Good s_i_r, remember what you said before,
      And goe to the church and marry mee.

    5
    'Ffaire maid, I cannott doe as I wold;
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    Goe home and fett thy fathers redd gold,
      And I'le goe to the church and marry thee.

    6
    This ladye is gone to her ffathers hall,
      And well she knew where his red gold lay,
    And counted fforth five hundred pound,
      Besides all other iuells and chaines:

    7
    And brought itt all to younge Andrew,
      Itt was well counted vpon his knee;
    Then he tooke her by the lillye white hand,
      And led her vp to an hill soe hye.

    8
    Shee had vpon a gowne of blacke veluett,
      (A pittyffull sight after yee shall see:)
    'Put of thy clothes, bonny wenche,' he sayes,
      'For noe ffoote further thoust gang w_i_th mee.'

    9
    But then shee put of her gowne of veluett,
      W_i_th many a salt teare from her eye,
    And in a kirtle of ffine breaden silke
      Shee stood beffore young Andrews eye.

    10
    Sais, O put off thy kirtle of silke,
      Ffor some and all shall goe with mee;
    And to my owne lady I must itt beare,
      Who I must needs loue better then thee.

    11
    Then shee put of her kirtle of silke,
      W_i_th many a salt teare still ffrom her eye;
    In a peticoate of scarlett redd
      Shee stood before young Andrewes eye.

    12
    Saies, O put of thy peticoate,
      For some and all of itt shall goe w_i_th mee;
    And to my owne lady I will itt beare,
      W_hi_ch dwells soe ffarr in a strange countrye.

    13
    But then shee put of her peticoate,
      W_i_th many a salt teare still from her eye,
    And in a smocke of braue white silke
      Shee stood before young Andrews eye.

    14
    Saies, O put of thy smocke of silke,
      For some and all shall goe w_i_th mee;
    Vnto my owne ladye I will itt beare,
      _Tha_t dwells soe ffarr in a strange countrye.

    15
    Sayes, O remember, young Andrew,
      Once of a woman you were borne;
    And ffor _tha_t birth _tha_t Marye bore,
      I pray you let my smocke be vpon!

    16
    'Yes, ffayre ladye, I know itt well,
      Once of a woman I was borne;
    Yett ffor noe birth _tha_t Mary bore,
      Thy smocke shall not be left here vpon.'

    17
    But then shee put of her head-geere ffine;
      Shee hadd billaments worth a hundred pound;
    The hayre _tha_t was vpon this bony wench head
      Couered her bodye downe to the ground.

    18
    Then he pulled forth a Scottish brand,
      And held itt there in his owne right hand;
    Saies, Whether wilt thou dye vpon my swords point, ladye,
      Or thow wilt goe naked home againe?

    19
    'Liffe is sweet,' then, 's_i_r,' said shee,
      'Therfore I pray you leaue mee w_i_th mine;
    Before I wold dye on yo_u_r swords point,
      I had rather goe naked home againe.

    20
    'My ffather,' shee sayes, 'is a right good erle
      As any remaines in his countrye;
    If euer he doe yo_u_r body take,
      Yo_u_'r sure to fflower a gallow tree.

    21
    'And I haue seuen brethren,' shee sayes,
      'And they are all hardy men and bold;
    Giff euer th['e] doe yo_u_r body take,
      You must neuer gang quicke ou_er_ the mold.'

    22
    'If yo_u_r ffather be a right good erle
      As any remaines in his owne countrye,
    Tush! he shall neuer my body take,
      I'le gang soe ffast ouer the sea.

    23
    'If you haue seuen brethren,' he sayes,
      'If they be neu_er_ soe hardy or bold,
    Tush! they shall neu_er_ my body take,
      I'le gang soe ffast into the Scottish mold.'

    24
    Now this ladye is gone to her fathers hall,
      When euery body their rest did take;
    But the Erle w_hi_ch was her ffather
      Lay waken for his deere daughters sake.

    25
    'But who is _tha_t,' her ffather can say,
      '_Tha_t soe priuilye knowes the pinn?'
    'It's Hellen, yo_u_r owne deere daughter, ffather,
      I pray you rise and lett me in.'

    26
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
      'Noe, by my hood!' q_uo_th her ffather then,
    'My [house] thoust neuer come w_i_thin,
      W_i_thout I had my red gold againe.'

    27
    'Nay, yo_u_r gold is gone, ffather!' said shee,
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    'Then naked thou came into this world,
      And naked thou shalt returne againe.'

    28
    'Nay! God fforgaue his death, father,' shee sayes,
      'And soe I hope you will doe mee;'
    'Away, away, thou cursed woman,
      I pray God an ill death thou may dye!'

    29
    Shee stood soe long quacking on the ground
      Till her hart itt burst in three;
    And then shee ffell dead downe in a swoond,
      And this was the end of this bonny ladye.

    30
    Ithe morning, when her ffather gott vpp,
      A pittyffull sight there he might see;
    His owne deere daughter was dead, w_i_thout clothes,
      The teares they trickeled fast ffrom his eye.

    31
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
      Sais, Fye of gold, and ffye of ffee!
    For I sett soe much by my red gold
      _Tha_t now itt hath lost both my daughter and mee!'

    32
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
      But after this time he neere dought good day,
    But as flowers doth fade in the frost,
      Soe he did wast and weare away.

    33
    But let vs leaue talking of this ladye,
      And talke some more of young Andrew;
    Ffor ffalse he was to this bonny ladye,
      More pitty _tha_t he had not beene true.

    34
    He was not gone a mile into the wild forrest,
      Or halfe a mile into the hart of Wales,
    But there they cought him by such a braue wyle
      _Tha_t hee must come to tell noe more tales.

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *


    35
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
      Ffull soone a wolfe did of him smell,
    And shee came roaring like a beare,
      And gaping like a ffeend of hell.

    36
    Soe they ffought together like two lyons,
      And fire betweene them two glashet out;
    Th['e] raught eche other such a great rappe,
      _Tha_t there young Andrew was slaine, well I wott.

    37
    But now young Andrew he is dead,
      But he was neuer buryed vnder mold,

        #G. a.# 'John and William,' taken down from the singing of
        little girls in South Boston. #b.# From a child in New
        York. Both communicated by Mr W. W. Newell.


All the Scottish versions were obtained within the first third of this
century, and since then no others have been heard of. It is interesting
to find the ballad still in the mouths of children in American
cities,--in the mouths of the poorest, whose heritage these old things
are.[401] The American versions, though greatly damaged, preserve the
names John and William, which all the other copies have.

#B# and #C# are considerably corrupted. It need hardly be mentioned that
the age of the boys in the first two stanzas of #B# does not suit the
story. According to #C# 8, 15, the mother had cursed John, before he
left home, with a wish that he might never return; and in #C# 9, John
sends word to his true-love that he is in his grave for her dear sake
alone. These points seem to have been taken from some copy of 'Willie
and May Margaret,' or 'The Drowned Lovers.' The conclusion of both #B#
and #C# belongs to 'Sweet William's Ghost.' #C# 18 may be corrected by
#B# 10, though there is an absurd jumble of pipes and harp in the
latter. The harp, in a deft hand, effects like wonders in many a ballad:
e. g., 'Harpens Kraft,' Grundtvig, II, 65, No 40; even a pipe in #C#
14-16 of the same.

#D#, #E#, #F#, #G# supplement the story with more or less of the ballad
of 'Edward:' see p. 168.

Jamieson inquires for this ballad in the Scots Magazine for October,
1803, p. 701, at which time he had only the first stanza and the first
half of the third. He fills out the imperfect stanza nearly as in the
copy which he afterwards printed:

    But out an Willie's taen his knife,
      And did his brother slay.

Of the five other Scottish versions, all except #B# make the deadly
wound to be the result of accident, and this is, in Motherwell's view, a
point essential. The other reading, he says, is at variance with the
rest of the story, and "sweeps away the deep impression this simple
ballad would otherwise have made upon the feelings: for it is almost
unnecessary to mention that its touching interest is made to centre in
the boundless sorrow and cureless remorse of him who had been the
unintentional cause of his brother's death, and in the solicitude which
that high-minded and generous spirit expresses, even in the last agonies
of nature, for the safety and fortunes of the truly wretched and unhappy
survivor." But the generosity of the dying man is plainly greater if his
brother has killed him in an outburst of passion; and what is gained
this way will fully offset the loss, if any, which comes from the
fratricide having cause for "cureless remorse" as well as boundless
sorrow. Motherwell's criticism, in fact, is not quite intelligible.
(Minstrelsy, p. 61.)

The variation in the story is the same as that between the English
'Cruel Brother' and the German 'Graf Friedrich:' in the former the bride
is killed by her offended brother; in the latter it is the bridegroom's
sword slipping from its sheath that inflicts the mortal hurt.

Motherwell was inclined to believe, and Kirkpatrick Sharpe was
convinced, that this ballad was founded upon an event that happened near
Edinburgh as late as 1589, that of one of the Somervilles having been
killed by his brother's pistol accidentally going off. Sharpe afterward
found a case of a boy of thirteen killing a young brother in anger at
having his hair pulled. This most melancholy story, the particulars of
which are given in the last edition of the Ballad Book, p. 130, note
xix, dates nearly a hundred years later, 1682. Only the briefest mention
need be made of these unusually gratuitous surmises.

Kirkland, in #D#, was probably suggested by the kirkyard of other
versions, assisted, possibly, by a reminiscence of the Kirkley in 'Robin
Hood's Death and Burial;' for it will be observed that stanzas 8, 9 of
#D# come pretty near to those in which Robin Hood gives direction for
his grave; #F# 9, 10, #B# 5, 6 less near.[402]

Cunningham has entitled a romance of his, upon the theme of 'The Two
Brothers' (which, once more, he ventures to print nearly in the state in
which he once had the pleasure of hearing it sung), 'Fair Annie of
Kirkland:' Songs of Scotland, II, 16.

The very pathetic passage in which the dying youth directs that father,
mother, and sister shall be kept in ignorance of his death, and then,
feeling how vain the attempt to conceal the fact from his true-love will
be, bids that she be informed that he is in his grave and will never
come back, is too truly a touch of nature to be found only here.
Something similar occurs in 'Mary Hamilton,' where, however, the
circumstances are very different:

    'And here's to the jolly sailor lad
      That sails upon the faeme!
    And let not my father nor mother get wit
      But that I shall come again.

    'And here's to the jolly sailor lad
      That sails upon the sea!
    But let not my father nor mother get wit
      O the death that I maun dee.'

In a fine Norse ballad (see 'Brown Robyn's Confession,' further on) a
man who is to be thrown overboard to save a ship takes his leave of the
world with these words:

    'If any of you should get back to land,
      And my foster-mother ask for me,
    Tell her I'm serving in the king's court,
      And living right merrily.

    'If any of you should get back to land,
      And my true-love ask for me,
    Bid her to marry another man,
      For I am under the sea.'

A baron, who has been mortally wounded in a duel, gives this charge to
his servant:

    'Faites mes compliments [a'] ma femme,
    Mais ne lui dites pas que j'ai ['e]t['e] tu['e];
    Mais dites lui que je serai all['e] [a'] Paris,
    Pour saluer le roi Louis.

    'Dites que je serai all['e] [a'] Paris,
    Pour saluer le roi Louis,
    Et que j'ai achet['e] un nouveau cheval,
    Le petit c[oe]ur de mon cheval ['e]tait trop gai.'

  (Le Seigneur de Rosmadec, Luzel, I, 368/369, 374/375.)

In like manner a dying klepht: "If our comrades ask about me, tell them
not that I have died: say only that I have married in strange lands;
have taken the flat stone for mother-in-law, the black earth for my
wife, the black worms for brothers-in-law." Zambelios, p. 606, No 11,
Fauriel, I, 51, Passow, p. 118, No 152; and again, Zambelios, p. 672, No
94, Passow, p. 113, No 146. In the Danish 'Elveskud,' Grundtvig, II,
115, No 47, B* 18, Ole would simply have the tragic truth kept from his
bride:

    'Hearken, Sir Ole, of mickle pride,
    How shall I answer thy young bride?'

    'You must say I am gone to the wood,
    To prove horse and hounds, if they be good.'

Such questions and answers as we have in #D# 20, #E# 17, #F# 24, are
of the commonest occurrence in popular poetry, and not unknown to the
poetry of art. Ballads of the 'Edward' class end generally or always in
this way: see p. 168. We have again the particular question and answer
which occur here in 'Lizie Wan' and in one version of 'The Trooper and
Fair Maid,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 158. The question may be:
When will you come back? When shall you cease to love me? When shall we
be married? etc.; and the answer: When apple-trees grow in the seas;
when fishes fly and seas gang dry; when all streams run together; when
all swift streams are still; when it snows roses and rains wine; when
all grass is rue; when the nightingale sings on the sea and the cuckoo
is heard in winter; when poplars bear cherries and oaks roses; when
feathers sink and stones swim; when sand sown on a stone germinates,
etc., etc. See Virgil, Ecl. i, 59-63; Ovid, Met. xiii, 324-27; Wolf,

    There were twa brethren in the north,
      They went to the school thegither;
    The one unto the other said,
      Will you try a warsle afore?

    2
    They warsled up, they warsled down,
      Till Sir John fell to the ground,
    And there was a knife in Sir Willie's pouch,
      Gied him a deadlie wound.

    3
    'Oh brither dear, take me on your back,
      Carry me to yon burn clear,
    And wash the blood from off my wound,
      And it will bleed nae mair.'

    4
    He took him up upon his back,
      Carried him to yon burn clear,
    And washd the blood from off his wound,
      But aye it bled the mair.

    5
    'Oh brither dear, take me on your back,
      Carry me to yon kirk-yard,
    And dig a grave baith wide and deep,
      And lay my body there.'

    6
    He's taen him up upon his back,
      Carried him to yon kirk-yard,
    And dug a grave baith deep and wide,
      And laid his body there.

    7
    'But what will I say to my father dear,
      Gin he chance to say, Willie, whar's John?'
    'Oh say that he's to England gone,
      To buy him a cask of wine.'

    8
    'And what will I say to my mother dear,
      Gin she chance to say, Willie, whar's John?'
    'Oh say that he's to England gone,
      To buy her a new silk gown.'

    9
    'And what will I say to my sister dear,
      Gin she chance to say, Willie, whar's John?'
    'Oh say that he's to England gone,
      To buy her a wedding ring.'

    10
    'But what will I say to her you loe dear,
      Gin she cry, Why tarries my John?'
    'Oh tell her I lie in Kirk-land fair,
      And home again will never come.'

    1
    There was two little boys going to the school,
      And twa little boys they be,
    They met three brothers playing at the ba,
      And ladies dansing hey.

    2
    'It's whether will ye play at the ba, brither,
      Or else throw at the stone?'
    'I am too little, I am too young,
      O brother let me alone.'

    3
    He pulled out a little penknife,
      That was baith sharp and sma,
    He gave his brother a deadly wound
      That was deep, long and sair.

    4
    He took the holland sark off his back,
      He tore it frae breast to gare,
    He laid it to the bloody wound,
      That still bled mair and mair.

    5
    'It's take me on your back, brother,' he says,
      'And carry me to yon kirk-yard,
    And make me there a very fine grave,
      That will be long and large.

    6
    'Lay my bible at my head,' he says,
      'My chaunter at my feet,
    My bow and arrows by my side,
      And soundly I will sleep.

    7
    'When you go home, brother,' he says,
      'My father will ask for me;
    You may tell him I am in Saussif town,
      Learning my lesson free.

    8
    'When you go home, brother,' he says,
      'My mother will ask for me;
    You may tell her I am in Sausaf town,
      And I'll come home merrily.

    9
    'When you go home, brother,' he says,
      'Lady Margaret will ask for me;
    You may tell her I'm dead and in grave laid,
      And buried in Sausaff toun.'

    10
    She put the small pipes to her mouth,
      And she harped both far and near,
    Till she harped the small birds off the briers,
      And her true love out of the grave.

    11
    'What's this? what's this, lady Margaret?' he says,
      'What's this you want of me?'
    'One sweet kiss of your ruby lips,
      That's all I want of thee.'

    12
    'My lips they are so bitter,' he says,
      'My breath it is so strong,
    If you get one kiss of my ruby lips,
      Your days will not be long.'

        Cunningham, Ayr.

    1
    There were twa brithers at ae scule;
      As they were coming hame,
    Then said the ane until the other
      'John, will ye throw the stane?'

    2
    'I will not throw the stane, brither,
      I will not play at the ba;
    But gin ye come to yonder wood
      I'll warsle you a fa.'

    3
    The firsten fa young Johnie got,
      It brought him to the ground;
    The wee pen-knife in Willie's pocket
      Gied him a deadly wound.

    4
    'Tak aff, tak aff my holland sark,
      And rive it frae gore to gore,
    And stap it in my bleeding wounds,
      They'll aiblins bleed noe more.'

    5
    He pouit aff his holland sark,
      And rave it frae gore to gore,
    And stapt it in his bleeding wounds,
      But ay they bled the more.

    6
    'O brither, tak me on your back,
      And bear me hence away,
    And carry me to Chester kirk,
      And lay me in the clay.'

    7
    'What will I say to your father,
      This night when I return?'
    'Tell him I'm gane to Chester scule,
      And tell him no to murn.'

    8
    'What will I say to your mother,
      This nicht whan I gae hame?'
    'She wishd afore I cam awa
      That I might neer gae hame.'

    9
    'What will I say to your true-love,
      This nicht when I gae hame?'
    'Tell her I'm dead and in my grave,
      For her dear sake alane.'

    10
    He took him upon his back
      And bore him hence away,
    And carried him to Chester kirk,
      And laid him in the clay.

    11
    He laid him in the cauld cauld clay,
      And he cuirt him wi a stane,
    And he's awa to his fathers ha,
      Sae dowilie alane.

    12
    'You're welcome, dear son,' he said,
      'You're welcome hame to me;
    But what's come o your brither John,
      That gade awa wi thee?'

    13
    'Oh he's awa to Chester scule,
      A scholar he'll return;
    He bade me tell his father dear
      About him no to murn.'

    14
    'You're welcome hame, dear son,' she said,
      'You're welcome hame to me;
    But what's come o your brither John,
      That gade awa wi thee?'

    15
    'He bade me tell his mother dear,
      This nicht when I cam hame,
    Ye wisht before he gade awa,
      That he might neer return.'

    16
    Then next came up his true-love dear,
      And heavy was her moan;
    'You're welcome hame, dear Will,' she said,
      'But whare's your brither John?'

    17
    'O lady, cease your trouble now,
      O cease your heavy moan;
    He's dead and in the cauld cauld clay,
      For your dear sake alone.'

    18
    She ran distraught, she wept, she sicht,
      She wept the sma brids frae the tree,
    She wept the starns adoun frae the lift,
      She wept the fish out o the sea.

    19
    'O cease your weeping, my ain true-love,
      Ye but disturb my rest;'
    'Is that my ain true lover John,
      The man that I loe best?'

    20
    ''T is naething but my ghaist,' he said,
      'That's sent to comfort thee;
    O cease your weeping, my true-love,
      And 't will gie peace to me.'

    Or will ye gae to the wood a-warslin,
      To see whilk o's maun fa?'

    But I will gae to the wood a-warslin,
      And it is you maun fa.'

    There were twa brothers at the scule,
      And when they got awa,
    'It's will ye play at the stane-chucking,
      Or will ye play at the ba,
    Or will ye gae up to yon hill head,
      And there we'll warsel a fa?'

    2
    'I winna play at the stane-chucking,
      Nor will I play at the ba;
    But I'll gae up to yon bonnie green hill,
      And there we'll warsel a fa.'

    3
    They warsled up, they warsled down,
      Till John fell to the ground;
    A dirk fell out of William's pouch,
      And gave John a deadly wound.

    4
    'O lift me upon your back,
      Take me to yon well fair,
    And wash my bluidy wounds oer and oer,
      And they'll neer bleed nae mair.'

    He's lifted his brother upon his back,
      Taen him to yon well fair;
    He's wash'd his bluidy wounds oer and oer,
      But they bleed ay mair and mair.

    6
    'Tak ye aff my holland sark,
      And rive it gair by gair,
    And row it in my bluidy wounds,
      And they'll neer bleed nae mair.'

    7
    He's taken aff his holland sark,
      And torn it gair by gair;
    He's rowit it in his bluidy wounds,
      But they bleed ay mair and mair.

    8
    'Tak now aff my green cleiding,
      And row me saftly in,
    And tak me up to yon kirk-style,
      Whare the grass grows fair and green.'

    9
    He's taken aff the green cleiding,
      And rowed him saftly in;
    He's laid him down by yon kirk-style,
      Whare the grass grows fair and green.

    10
    'What will ye say to your father dear,
      When ye gae hame at een?'
    'I'll say ye're lying at yon kirk-style,
      Whare the grass grows fair and green.'

    11
    'O no, O no, my brother dear,
      O you must not say so;
    But say that I'm gane to a foreign land,
      Whare nae man does me know.'

    12
    When he sat in his father's chair,
      He grew baith pale and wan:
    'O what blude's that upon your brow?
      O dear son, tell to me;'
    'It is the blude o my gude gray steed,
      He wadna ride wi me.'

    13
    'O thy steed's blude was neer sae red,
      Nor eer sae dear to me:
    O what blude's this upon your cheek?
      O dear son, tell to me;'
    'It is the blude of my greyhound,
      He wadna hunt for me.'

    14
    'O thy hound's blude was neer sae red,
      Nor eer sae dear to me:
    O what blude's this upon your hand?
      O dear son, tell to me;'
    'It is the blude of my gay goss-hawk,
      He wadna flee for me.'

    'O thy hawk's blude was neer sae red,
      Nor eer sae dear to me:
    O what blude's this upon your dirk?
      Dear Willie, tell to me;'
    'It is the blude of my ae brother,
      O dule and wae is me!'

    16
    'O what will ye say to your father?
      Dear Willie, tell to me;'
    'I'll saddle my steed, and awa I'll ride,
      To dwell in some far countrie.'

    17
    'O when will ye come hame again?
      Dear Willie, tell to me;'
    'When sun and mune leap on yon hill,
      And that will never be.'

    18
    She turnd hersel right round about,
      And her heart burst into three:
    'My ae best son is deid and gane,
      And my tother ane I'll neer see.'

    'O when will ye come back again,
      My dear son, tell to me?'
    'When sun and moon gae three times round,
      And this will never be.'

    25
    'Ohon, alas! now William, my son,

    Your brother's death I'll aye bewail,
      And the absence o thee.'

        1880. Communicated by Mr W. W. Newell.

    1
    As John and William were coming home one day,
      One Saturday afternoon,
    Says John to William, Come and try a fight,
      Or will you throw a stone?
      Or will you come down to yonder, yonder town
      Where the maids are all playing ball, ball, ball,
      Where the maids are all playing ball?

    2
    Says William to John, I will not try a fight,
      Nor will I throw a stone,
    Nor will I come down to yonder town,
      Where the maids are all playing ball.

    3
    So John took out of his pocket
      A knife both long and sharp,
    And stuck it through his brother's heart,
      And the blood came pouring down.

    4
    Says John to William, Take off thy shirt,
      And tear it from gore to gore,
    And wrap it round your bleeding heart,
      And the blood will pour no more.'

    5
    So John took off his shirt,
      And tore it from gore to gore,
    And wrapped it round his bleeding heart,
      And the blood came pouring more.

    6
    'What shall I tell your dear father,
      When I go home to-night?'
    'You'll tell him I'm dead and in my grave,
      For the truth must be told.'

    7
    'What shall I tell your dear mother,
      When I go home to-night?'
    'You'll tell her I'm dead and in my grave,
    For the truth must be told.'

    8
    'How came this blood upon your knife?
      My son, come tell to me;'
    'It is the blood of a rabbit I have killed,
      O mother, pardon me.'

    9
    'The blood of a rabbit couldnt be so pure,
      My son, come tell to me:'
    'It is the blood of a squirrel I have killed,

    'The blood of a squirrel couldnt be so pure,
      My son, come tell to me:'

THE BONNY HIND

        'The Bonny Hyn,' Herd's MSS, I, 224; II, fol. 65, fol. 83.


This piece is transcribed three times in Herd's manuscripts, with a note
prefixed in each instance that it was copied from the mouth of a
milkmaid in 1771. An endorsement to the same effect on the last
transcript gives the date as 1787, no doubt by mistake. Scott had only
MS. I in his hands, which accidentally omits two stanzas (13, 14), and
he printed this defective copy with the omission of still another (4):
Minstrelsy, II, 298, ed. 1802; III, 309, ed. 1833. Motherwell supplies
these omitted stanzas, almost in Herd's very words, in the Introduction
to his collection, p. lxxxiv, note 99. He remarks, p. 189, that tales of
this kind abound in the traditionary poetry of Scotland. The two ballads
which follow, Nos 51, 52, are of the same general description.

In the first half of the story 'The Bonny Hind' comes very near
to the fine Scandinavian ballad of 'Margaret,' as yet known to be
preserved only in F[:a]r[:o]e and Icelandic. The conclusions differ
altogether. Margaret in the F[:a]r[:o]e ballad, 'Margretu kv[ae][dh]i,'
F[ae]r[:o]iske Kv[ae]der, Hammershaimb, No 18, is the only daughter of
the Norwegian king Magnus, and has been put in a convent. After two
or three months she longs to see her father's house again. On her way
thither she is assaulted by a young noble with extreme violence: to
whom she says,

    Now you have torn off all my clothes, and done me sin and shame,
    I beg you, before God most high, tell me what is your name.

Magnus, he answers, is his father, and Gertrude his mother, and he
himself is Olaf, and was brought up in the woods. By this she recognizes
that he is her own brother. Olaf begs her to go back to the convent,
and say nothing, bearing her sorrow as she may. This she does. But every
autumn the king makes a feast, and invites to it all the nuns in the
cloister. Margaret is missed, and asked for. Is she sick or dead? Why
does she not come to the feast, like other merry dames? The wicked
abbess answers, Your daughter is neither sick nor dead; she goes with
child, like other merry dames. The king rides off to the cloister,
encounters his daughter, and demands who is the father of her child. She
replies that she will sooner die than tell. The king leaves her in
wrath, but returns presently, resolved to burn the convent, and Margaret
in it, Olaf comes from the wood, tired and weary, sees the cloister
burning, and quenches the flames with his heart's blood.

The Icelandic ballad, 'Margr[e']tar kv[ae][dh]i,' ['I]slenzk
Fornkv[ae][dh]i, Grundtvig and Sigur[dh]sson, No 14, has the same
story. It is, however, the man who brings on the discovery by asking
the woman's parentage. The editors inform us that the same subject is
treated in an unprinted Icelandic ballad, less popular as to style and
stanza, in the Arne Magnussen collection, 154.

The story of Kullervo, incorporated in what is called the national epic
of the Finns, the Kalevala, has striking resemblances with the ballads
of the Bonny Hind class. While returning home in his sledge from a
somewhat distant errand, Kullervo met three times a girl who was
travelling on snow-shoes, and invited her to get in with him. She
rejected his invitation with fierceness, and the third time he pulled
her into the sledge by force. She angrily bade him let her go, or she
would dash the sledge to pieces; but he won her over by showing her rich
things. The next morning she asked what was his race and family; for it
seemed to her that he must come of a great line. "No," he said, "neither
of great nor small. I am Kalervo's unhappy son. Tell me of what stock
art thou." "Of neither great nor small," she answered. "I am Kalervo's
unhappy daughter." She was, in fact, a long-lost sister of Kullervo's,
who, when a child, had gone to the wood for berries, and had never found
her way home. She had wept the first day and the second; the third and
fourth, the fifth and sixth, she had tried every way to kill herself.
She broke out in heart-piercing lamentations:

    'O that I had died then, wretched!
    O that I had perished, weak one!
    Had not lived to hear these horrors,
    Had not lived this shame to suffer!'

So saying she sprang from the sledge into the river, and found relief
under the waters.

Kullervo, mad with anguish, went home to his mother, and told her what
had happened. He asked only how he might die,--by wolf or bear, by whale
or sea-pike. His mother vainly sought to soothe him. He consented to
live only till the wrongs of his parents had been revenged. His mother
tried to dissuade him even from seeking a hero's death in fight.

    'If thou die in battle, tell me,
    What protection shall remain then
    For the old age of thy father?'
    'Let him die in any alley,
    Lay his life down in the house-yard.'
    'What protection shall remain then
    For the old age of thy mother?'
    'Let her die on any straw-truss;
    Let her stifle in the stable.'
    'Who shall then be left thy brother,
    Who stand by him in mischances?'
    'Let him pine away in the forest,
    Let him drop down on the common.'
    'Who shall then be left thy sister,
    Who stand by her in mischances?'
    'When she goes to the well for water,
    Or to the washing, let her stumble.'

Kullervo had his fill of revenge. Meanwhile father, brother, sister, and
mother died, and he came back to his home to find it empty and cold. A
voice from his mother's grave seemed to direct him to go to the wood for
food: obeying it, he came again to the polluted spot, where grass or
flowers would not grow any more. He asked his sword would it like to
feed on guilty flesh and drink wicked blood. The sword said, Why should
I not like to feed on guilty flesh and drink wicked blood, I that feed
on the flesh of the good and drink the blood of the sinless? Kullervo
set the sword hilt in the earth, and threw himself on the point.
(Kalewala, [:u]bertragen von Schiefner, runes 35, 36.)

The dialogue between Kullervo and his mother is very like a passage in
another Finnish rune, 'Werinen Pojka,' 'The Bloody Son,' Schr[:o]ter,
Finnische Runen, 124, ed. 1819; 150, ed. 1834. This last is a form of
the ballad known in Scottish as 'Edward,' No 13, or of 'The Twa
Brothers,' No 49. Something similar is found in 'Lizie Wan,' No 51.

The passage 5-7 is a commonplace that may be expected to recur under the
same or analogous circumstances, as it does in 'Tam Lin,' #D#, 'The
Knight and Shepherd's Daughter,' 'The Maid and the Magpie,' and in one
version of 'The Broom of Cowdenknows.' These are much less serious
ballads, and the tone of stanza 5, which so ill befits the distressful
situation, is perhaps owing to that stanza's having been transferred
from some copy of one of these. It might well change places with this,
from 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter,' #A#:

    Sith you have had your will of me,
      And put me to open shame,
    Now, if you are a courteous knight,
      Tell me what is your name.

Much better with the solemn adjuration in the F[:a]r[:o]e 'Margaret,'
or even this in 'Ebbe Galt,' Danske Viser, No 63, 8:

    Now you have had your will of me,
      To both of us small gain,
    By the God that is above all things,
      I beg you tell your name.

    O may she comes, and may she goes,

      As squire had ever been.

    2

LIZIE WAN

        #A. a.# 'Lizie Wan,' Herd's MSS, I, 151; II, 78. #b.#
        Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 91.

        #B.# 'Rosie Ann,' Motherwell's MS., p. 398.


#A#, first printed in Herd's Scottish Songs, ed. 1776, is here given
from his manuscript copy. #B# is now printed for the first time.

#A# is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og Skotske Folkeviser, No 50,
who subjoins a Danish ballad, 'Liden Ellen og hendes Broder,' of similar
character. Of this the editor had three versions, differing but little,
and all of slight poetical value, and he prints one which was committed
to writing some sixty or seventy years ago, with some readings from the
others. Liden Jensen, having killed Liden Ellen in a wood, pretends to
his mother that she has gone off with some knights. He is betrayed by
blood on his clothes, confesses the truth, and is condemned to be
burned. 'Herr Axel,' Arwidsson's Swedish collection, No 46, I, 308,
under similar circumstances, kills Stolts Kirstin's two children, is
asked by his mother why his hands are bloody, pretends to have slain a
hind in the wood, and has his head struck off by order of his father.

'Herr Peder og hans S[:o]ster,' an unpublished Danish ballad, of which
Grundtvig obtained a single traditional version, has also a slight
resemblance to 'Lizie Wan.' Kirsten invites Sir Peter to her bed. He
declines for various reasons, which she refutes. She discovers him to be
her brother by her needle-work in his shirt. He draws his knife and
stabs her. "This was also a pitiful sight, the twin children playing in
the mother's bosom." Compare Kristensen, II, No 74 #A#, #D#, #E#, at the
end.

The conclusion, #A# 11-12, #B# 10-17, resembles that of 'The Twa
Brothers,' No 49, but is poetically much inferior.

      'What ails thee, Lizie Wan?'

    'I ail, and I ail, dear father,' she said,
      'And I'll tell you a reason for why;
    There is a child between my twa sides,

    Now Lizie Wan sits at her father's bower-door,

    'And hast thou tald father and mother o that?

    And he has drawn his gude braid sword,

    And he has cutted aff Lizie Wan's head,

    And he's awa to his mothers bower,
      And sair aghast was he.

    7
    'What ails thee, what ails thee, Geordy Wan?

#B# is the ballad referred to, and partly cited, in Motherwell's preface
to 'The Broom blooms bonnie and says it is fair,' Minstrelsy, p. 189.
This copy has been extremely injured by tradition; so much so as not to
be intelligible in places except by comparison with #A#. The act
described in stanza 9 should be done by the king's daughter's own hand;
stanza 12 should be addressed by her to her sister; stanza 13 is
composed of fragments of two. #C# and #D# have suffered worse, for they
have been corrupted and vulgarized.

At the beginning there is resemblance to 'Tam Lin' and to 'Hind Etin.'

    1
    The king's young dochter was sitting in her window,
      Sewing at her silken seam;
    She lookt out o the bow-window,
      And she saw the leaves growing green, my luve,
      And she saw the leaves growing green.

    2
    She stuck her needle into her sleeve,
      Her seam down by her tae,
    And she is awa to the merrie green-wood,
      To pu the nit and slae.

    3
    She hadna pu't a nit at a',
      A nit but scarcely three,
    Till out and spak a braw young man,
      Saying, How daur ye bow the tree?

    4
    'It's I will pu the nit,' she said,
      'And I will bow the tree,
    And I will come to the merrie green wud,
      And na ax leive o thee.'

    5
    He took her by the middle sae sma,
      And laid her on the gerss sae green,
    And he has taen his will o her,
      And he loot her up agen.

    6
    'Now syn ye hae got your will o me,
      Pray tell to me your name;
    For I am the king's young dochter,' she said,
      'And this nicht I daurna gang hame.'

    7
    'Gif ye be the king's young dochter,' he said,
      'I am his auldest son;
    I wish I had died on some frem isle,
      And never had come hame!

    8
    'The first time I came hame, Jeanie,
      Thou was na here nor born;
    I wish my pretty ship had sunk,
      And I had been forlorn!

    9
    'The neist time I came hame, Jeanie,
      Thou was sittin on the nourice knee;
    And I wish my pretty ship had sunk,
      And I had never seen thee!

    'And the neist time I came hame, Jeanie,
      I met thee here alane;
    I wish my pretty ship had sunk,
      And I had neer come hame!'

    11
    She put her hand down by her side,
      And doun into her spare,
    And she pou't out a wee pen-knife,
      And she wounded hersell fu sair.

    12
    Hooly, hooly rase she up,
      And hooly she gade hame,
    Until she came to her father's parlour,
      And there she did sick and mane.

    13
    'O sister, sister, mak my bed,
      O the clean sheets and strae,
    O sister, sister, mak my bed,
      Down in the parlour below.'

    14
    Her father he came tripping down the stair,
      His steps they were fu slow;
    'I think, I think, Lady Jean,' he said,
      'Ye're lying far ower low.'

    15
    'O late yestreen, as I came hame,
      Down by yon castil wa,

      That on my briest did fa!'

    16
    Her mother she came tripping doun the stair,
      Her steps they were fu slow;
    'I think, I think, Lady Jean,' she said,

    17

      And they died as white as snaw.

    She's drapt the thimble at her tae,
      And her scissars at her heel,
    And she's awa to the merry green-wood,
      To see the leaves grow green.

    3
    She had scarsely bowed a branch,
      Or plucked a nut frae the tree,
    Till up and starts a fair young man,
      And a fair young man was he.

    4
    'How dare ye shake the leaves?' he said,
      'How dare ye break the tree?
    How dare ye pluck the nuts,' he said,
      'Without the leave of me?'

    He gript her by the middle sae sma,
      He gently sat her down,
    While the grass grew up on every side,
      And the apple trees hang down.

    7
    She says, Young man, what is your name?
      For ye've brought me to meikle shame;
    For I am the king's youngest daughter,
      And how shall I gae hame?

    8
    'If you're the king's youngest daughter,
      It's I'm his auldest son,
    And heavy heavy is the deed, sister,
      That you and I have done.'

    9
    He had a penknife in his hand,
      Hang low down by his gair,
    And between the long rib and the short one
      He woundit her deep and sair.

      And slowly slipt it in the wound,

    1
    As Annie sat into her bower,
      A thought came in her head,
    That she would gang to gude greenwood,
      Across the flowery mead.

    2
    She hadna pu'd a flower, a flower,
      Nor broken a branch but twa,
    Till by it came a gentle squire,
      Says, Lady, come awa.

    3
    There's nane that comes to gude greenwood
      But pays to me a tein,
    And I maun hae your maidenhead,
      Or than your mantle green.

    4
    'My mantle's o the finest silk,
      Anither I can spin;
    But gin you take my maidenhead,
      The like I'll never fin.'

    5
    He's taen her by the milk-white hand,
      And by the grass-green sleeve,
    There laid her low in gude greenwood,
      And at her spierd nae leave.

    6
    When he had got his wills o her,
      His wills as he had taen,
    She said, If you rightly knew my birth,
      Ye'd better letten alane.

    7
    'Is your father a lord o might?
      Or baron o high degree?
    Or what race are ye sprung frae,
      That I should lat ye be?'

    8
    'O I am Castle Ha's daughter,
      O birth and high degree,
    And if he knows what ye hae done,
      He'll hang you on a tree.'

    9
    'If ye be Castle Ha's daughter,
      This day I am undone;
    If ye be Castle Ha's daughter,
      I am his only son.'

    10
    'Ye lie, ye lie, ye jelly hind squire,
      Sae loud as I hear you lie,
    Castle Ha, he has but ae dear son,
      And he is far beyond the sea.'

    11
    'O I am Castle Ha's dear son,
      A word I dinna lie;
    Yes, I am Castle Ha's dear son,
      And new come oer the sea.

    12
    ''Twas yesterday, that fatal day,
      That I did cross the faem;
    I wish my bonny ship had sunk,
      And I had neer come hame.'

    13
    Then dowie, dowie, raise she up,
      And dowie came she hame,
    And stripped aff her silk mantle,
      And then to bed she's gane.

    14
    Then in it came her mother dear,
      And she steps in the fleer:
    'Win up, win up, now fair Annie,
      What makes your lying here?'

    15
    'This morning fair, as I went out,
      Near by yon castle wa,
    Great and heavy was the stane
      That on my foot did fa.'

    16
    'Hae I nae ha's, hae I nae bowers,
      Towers, or mony a town?
    Will not these cure your bonny foot,
      Gar you gae hale and soun?'

    17
    'Ye hae ha's, and ye hae bowers,
      And towers, and mony a town,
    But nought will cure my bonny foot,
      Gar me gang hale and soun.'

    18
    Then in it came her father dear,
      And he trips in the fleer:
    'Win up, win up, now fair Annie,
      What makes your lying here?'

    19
    'This morning fair, as I went out,
      Near by yon castle wa,

    20
    'Hae I nae ha's, hae I nae bowers,
      And towers, and mony a town?
    Will not these cure your bonny foot,
      Gar you gang hale and soun?'

    21
    'O ye hae ha's, and ye hae bowers,
      And towers, and mony a town,
    But nought will cure my bonny foot,
      Gar me gang hale and soun.'

    22
    Then in it came her sister Grace;
      As she steps in the fleer,
    'Win up, win up, now fair Annie,
      What makes your lying here?

    23
    'Win up, and see your ae brother,
      That's new come ower the sea;'
    'Ohon, alas!' says fair Annie,
      'He spake ower soon wi me.'

    24
    To her room her brother's gane,
      Stroked back her yellow hair,
    To her lips his ain did press,

#A#, #B#, #D#, #F#, and the fragment #G# now appear for the first time
in print, and the same is true of #I#, #J#, #K#, which are of less
account. #C a# is here given according to the manuscript, without
Jamieson's "collations." Of #E# and #C b# Jamieson says: This ballad and
that which succeeds it are given from copies taken from Mrs Brown's
recitation,[403] collated with two other copies procured from Scotland;
one in MS.; another, very good, one printed for the stalls; a third, in
the possession of the late Reverend Jonathan Boucher, of Epsom, taken
from recitation in the north of England; and a fourth, about one third
as long as the others, which the editor picked off an old wall in
Piccadilly. #L#, the only English copy, was derived from the singing of
a London vagrant. It is, says Dixon, the common English broadsheet
"turned into the dialect of Cockaigne."[404] #M# was probably a
broadside or stall copy, and is certainly of that quality, but preserves
a very ancient traditional feature.

#D# and #M#, besides the name Linne, have in common a repetition of the
song, a trait which we also find in one version of 'The Heir of
Linne;'[405] see Dixon's Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient
Ballads, p. 30, stanzas 2-6, Percy Society, vol. XVII.

In Bell's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England,
p. 68, it is remarked that #L#, "the only ancient form in which the
ballad has existed in print," is one of the publications mentioned in
one of Thackeray's catalogues of broadsides. The 'Bateman,' in
Thackeray's list, is the title of an entirely different ballad, 'A
Warning for Maidens, or Young Bateman,' reprinted from the Roxburghe
collection by W. Chappell, III, 193.

"Young Beichan" is a favorite ballad, and most deservedly. There are
beautiful repetitions of the story in the ballads of other nations, and
it has secondary affinities with the extensive cycle of 'Hind Horn,' the
parts of the principal actors in the one being inverted in the other.

The hero's name is mostly Beichan, with slight modifications like Bekie,
#C#, Bicham, #A#, Brechin, #B#; in #L#, Bateman; in #M#, Bondwell. The
heroine is Susan Pye in ten of the fourteen versions; Isbel in #C#;
Essels, evidently a variety of Isbel, in #M#, which has peculiar
relations with #C#; Sophia in #K#, #L#.

Beichan is London born in #A#, #D#, [#E#], #H#, #I#, #N#, English born
in #B#; London city is his own, #A# 6, #B# 7, #F# 7, or he has a hall
there, #I# 7, #N# 27 f.; half Northumberland belongs to him, #L#; he is
lord of the towers of Line, #D# 9, #C# 5, #M# 5, which are in London,
#D# 15 f, but are transferred by reciters to the water of Tay, #M# 29,
and to Glasgow, or the vicinity, #H# 20. #H#, though it starts with
calling him London born, speaks of him thereafter as a Scottish lord,
12, 18, 31.[406]

Beichan has an Englishman's desire strange countries for to see, #A#,
#D#, [#E#], #I#, #L#, #N#. In #C#, #M# he goes abroad, Quentin Durward
fashion, not to gratify his taste for travel, but to serve for meat and
fee. #F# makes him go to the Holy Land, without specifying his motive,
but we may fairly suppose it religious. #C# sends him no further than
France, and #M# to an unnamed foreign land. He becomes the slave of a
Moor or Turk, #A#, #B#, #D#, #H#, #I#, #L#, #N#, or a "Prudent," #F#,
who treats him cruelly. They bore his shoulders and put in a "tree," and
make him draw carts, like horse or ox, #A#, #B#, #D#, [#E#], #H#; draw
plough and harrow, #F#, plough and cart, #N#; or tread the wine-press,
#I#. This is because he is a staunch Christian, and would never bend a
knee to Mahound or Termagant, #E#, or onie of their stocks, #H#, or
gods, #I#. They cast him into a dungeon, where he can neither hear nor
see, and he is nigh perishing with hunger. This, also, is done in #H# 5,
on account of his perseverance in Christianity; but in #C#, #M# he is
imprisoned for falling in love with the king's daughter, or other lovely
may.

From his prison Beichan makes his moan (not to a stock or a stone, but
to the Queen of Heaven, #D# 4). His hounds go masterless, his hawks flee
from tree to tree, his younger brother will heir his lands, and he shall
never see home again, #E#, #H#. If a lady [earl] would borrow him, he
would run at her stirrup; if a widow [auld wife] would borrow him, he
would become her son; and if a maid would borrow him, he would wed her
with a ring, #C#, #D#, #M#, #B#.[407] The only daughter of the Moor,
Turk, or king (of a 'Savoyen,' #B# 5, perhaps a corruption of Saracen),
already interested in the captive, or immediately becoming so upon
hearing Beichan's song, asks him if he has lands and means at home to
maintain a lady that should set him free, and is told that he has ample
estates, all of which he would bestow on such a lady, #A#, #B#, #E#,
#F#, #H#, #L#, #N#. She steals the keys and delivers the prisoner, #C#,
#D#, #E#, #I#, #J#, #L#, #M#, #N#; refreshes him with bread and wine
[wine], #A#, #D#, #E#, #F#, #J# 4, #K# 3, #B#, #H#, #L#; supplies him
with money, #C# 9, #H# 15, #M# 12, #N# 14, and with a ship, #F# 9, #H#
18, #L# 9; to which #C#, #M# add a horse and hounds [and hawks, #M#].
She bids him mind on the lady's love that freed him out of pine, #A# 8,
#D# 12, [#E# 13], #M# 14, #N# 15, and in #E# 16 breaks a ring from her
finger, and gives half of it to Beichan to assist his memory. There is a
solemn vow, or at least a clear understanding, that they are to marry
within seven years, #A# 9, #B# 9, #E# 12 f., #H# 17, 19, #L# 8, #N# 11
[three years, #C# 11].

When seven years are at an end, or even before, Susan Pye feels a
longing, or a misgiving, which impels her to go in search of the object
of her affections, and she sets her foot on good shipboard, and turns
her back on her own country, #A# 10, #B# 10, #D# 15, #L# 10, #N#
23.[408] #C# and #M# preserve here a highly important feature which is
wanting in the other versions. Isbel, or Essels, is roused from her
sleep by the Billy Blin, #C# 14, by a woman in green, a fairy, #M# 15,
who makes known to her that that very day, or the morn, is Bekie's
[Bondwell's] wedding day. She is directed to attire herself and her
maids very splendidly, and go to the strand; a vessel will come sailing
to her, and they are to go on board. The Billy Blin will row her over
the sea, #C# 19; she will stroke the ship with a wand, and take God to
be her pilot, #M# 19. Thus, by miraculous intervention, she arrives at
the nick of time.

Beichan's fickleness is not accounted for in most of the versions. He
soon forgot his deliverer and courted another, he was young, and thought
not upon Susan Pye, say #H#, #N#. #C#, on the contrary, tells us that
Beichan had not been a twelvemonth in his own country, when he was
forced to marry a duke's daughter or lose all his land. #E# and #K#
intimate that he acts under constraint; the wedding has lasted three and
thirty days, and he will not bed with his bride for love of one beyond
the sea, #E# 21, #K# 1.[409]

On landing, Susan Pye falls in with a shepherd feeding his flock, #E#,
#K# [a boy watering his steeds, #M#]. She asks, Whose are these sheep,
these kye, these castles? and is told they are Lord Beichan's, #G#. She
asks the news, and is informed that there is a wedding in yonder hall
that has lasted thirty days and three, #E#, #K#, or that there is to be
a wedding on the morn, #M#; it seems to be a matter generally known,
#N#. In other versions she comes directly to Young Beichan's hall, and
is first informed by the porter, #A#, #B#, #F#, #H#, #L#, or the fact is
confirmed by the porter, #E#, #M#, #N#; she hears the music within, and
divines, #C#. She bribes the porter to bid the bridegroom come and
speak to her, #A#, #B#, #C#, #D#, #J#, #N#; send her down bread and
wine, and not forget the lady who brought him out of prison, #B#, #F#,
#H#, #J#, #K#, #L#. In #E# 26 she sends up her half ring to the
bridegroom [a ring in #N# 40, but not till Beichan has declined to come
down].

The porter falls on his knee and informs his master that the fairest and
richest lady that eyes ever saw is at the gate [ladies, #C#, #M#]. The
bride, or the bride's mother more commonly, reproves the porter for his
graceless speech; he might have excepted the bride, or her mother, or
both: "Gin she be braw without, we's be as braw within." But the porter
is compelled by truth to persist in his allegation; fair as they may be,
they were never to compare with yon lady, #B#, #D#, #E#, #H#, #M#.
Beichan takes the table with his foot and makes the cups and cans to
flee, #B# 18, #D# 23, #F# 28, #G# 3, #H# 47, #J# 5, #N# 42;[410] he
exclaims that it can be none but Susie Pye, #A#, #B#, #D#, #G#, #H#, #I#
[Burd Isbel, #C#], and clears the stair, fifteen steps, thirty steps, in
three bounds, #A# 19, #D# 24, #N# 43. His old love reproaches him for
his forgetfulness, #A#, #C#, #D#, #M#, #N#;[411] she asks back her faith
and troth, #B# 21. Beichan bids the forenoon bride's mother take back
her daughter: he will double her dowry, #A# 22, #D# 27, #E# 39; she came
on horseback, she shall go back in chariots, coaches, three, #B# 22, #D#
27[412] [#H# 49, in chariot free]. He marries Susie Pye, having her
baptized by the name of Lady Jean, #A#, #B#, #D#, [#E#], #F#, #I#,
#J#.[413]

This story of Beichan, or Bekie, agrees in the general outline, and also
in some details, with a well-known legend about Gilbert Beket, father of
St Thomas. The earlier and more authentic biographies lack this
particular bit of romance, but the legend nevertheless goes back to a
date not much later than a century after the death of the saint, being
found in a poetical narrative preserved in a manuscript of about
1300.[414]

We learn from this legend that Gilbert Beket, in his youth, assumed the
cross and went to the Holy Land, accompanied only by one Richard, his
servant. They "did their pilgrimage" in holy places, and at last, with
other Christians, were made captive by the Saracens and put in strong
prison. They suffered great hardship and ignominy in the service of the
Saracen prince Admiraud. But Gilbert found more grace than the rest; he
was promoted to serve the prince at meat (in his chains), and the prince
often would ask him about England and the English faith. Admiraud's only
daughter fell in love with Gilbert, and when she saw her time, in turn
asked him the like questions. Gilbert told her that he was born in
London; told her of the belief of Christians, and of the endless bliss
that should be their meed. The maid asked him if he was ready to die
for his Lord's love, and Gilbert declared that he would, joyfully. When
the maid saw that he was so steadfast, she stood long in thought, and
then said, I will quit all for love of thee, and become Christian, if
thou wilt marry me. Gilbert feared that this might be a wile; he replied
that he was at her disposition, but he must bethink himself. She went on
loving him, the longer the more. After this Gilbert and the rest broke
prison and made their way to the Christians. The prince's daughter,
reduced to desperation by love and grief, left her heritage and her kin,
sparing for no sorrow, peril, or contempt that might come to her, not
knowing whither to go or whether he would marry her when found, and went
in quest of Gilbert. She asked the way to England, and when she had come
there had no word but London to assist her further. She roamed through
the streets, followed by a noisy and jeering crowd of wild boys and what
not, until one day by chance she stopped by the house in which Gilbert
lived. The man Richard, hearing a tumult, came out to see what was the
matter, recognized the princess, and ran to tell his master.[415]
Gilbert bade Richard take the lady to the house of a respectable woman
near by, and presently went to see her. She swooned when she saw him.
Gilbert was nothing if not discreet: he "held him still," as if he had
nothing in mind. But there was a conference of six bishops just then at
St. Paul's, and he went and told them his story and asked advice. One of
the six prophetically saw a divine indication that the two were meant to
be married, and all finally recommended this if the lady would become
Christian. Brought before the bishops, she said, Most gladly, if he will
espouse me; else I had not left my kin. She was baptized[416] with great
ceremony, and the marriage followed.

The very day after the wedding Gilbert was seized with such an
overmastering desire to go back to the Holy Land that he wist not what
to do. But his wife was thoroughly converted, and after a struggle with
herself she consented, on condition that Beket should leave with her the
man Richard, who knew her language. Gilbert was gone three years and a
half, and when he came back Thomas was a fine boy.

That our ballad has been _affected_ by the legend of Gilbert Beket is
altogether likely. The name Bekie is very close to Beket, and several
versions, #A#, #D#, #H#, #I#, #N#, set out rather formally with the
announcement that Bekie was London born, like the Latin biographies and
the versified one of Garnier de Pont Sainte Maxence. Our ballad, also,
in some versions, has the Moor's daughter baptized, a point which of
course could not fail in the legend. More important still is it that the
hero of the English ballad goes home and forgets the woman he has left
in a foreign land, instead of going away from home and forgetting the
love he has left there. But the ballad, for all that, is not derived
from the legend. Stories and ballads of the general cast of 'Young
Beichan' are extremely frequent.[417] The legend lacks some of the main
points of these stories, and the ballad, in one version or another, has
them, as will be seen by referring to what has been said under 'Hind
Horn,' pp 194 ff. Bekie and Beket go to the East, like Henry and
Reinfrit of Brunswick, the Noble Moringer, the good Gerhard, Messer
Torello, the Sire de Cr['e]qui, Alexander of Metz, and others. Like the
larger part of these, they are made prisoners by the Saracens. He will
not bow the knee to Mahound; neither will the Sire de Cr['e]qui, though he
die for it.[418] Beichan is made to draw cart, plough, harrow, like a
beast. So Henry of Brunswick in a Swedish and a Danish ballad,[419] and
Alexander von Metz, or the Graf von Rom, in his most beautiful and
touching story.[420] Henry of Brunswick is set free by a "heathen" lady
in the Danish ballad. In one version of Beichan, #E#, the lady on
parting with her love breaks her ring and gives him one half, as Henry,
or his wife, Reinfrit, Gerhard, Cr['e]qui, and others do. At this point in
the story the woman pursues the man, and parts are inverted. Susan Pye
is warned that Beichan is to be married the next day, in #C# by a
Billy-Blin, in #M# by a woman in green, or fairy, and is conveyed to
Beichan's castle or hall with miraculous despatch, just as Henry and
others are warned, and are transported to their homes by devil, angel,
or necromancer. In #E# and #N# the old love is identified by a half ring
or ring, as in so many of the stories of the class of Henry the Lion.

Norse, Spanish, and Italian ballads preserve a story essentially the
same as that of 'Young Beichan.'

The variations of these twelve versions are insignificant. The names
Herr Peder den Rige and Ellensborg [Ellen] are found in nearly all. It
comes into Sir Peter's mind that he ought to go to Jerusalem to expiate
his sins, and he asks his betrothed, Ellensborg, how long she will wait
for him. She will wait eight years, and marry no other, though the king
should woo her [seven, #L#; nine, #M#, "If I do not come then, break the
engagement;" eight, and not more, #N#]. The time passes and Peter does
not come back. Ellensborg goes to the strand. Traders come steering in,
and she is asked to buy of their ware,--sendal, linen, and silk green as
leek. She cares not for these things; have they not seen her sister's
son [brother], for whom she is grieving to death? They know nothing of
her sister's son, but well they know Sir Peter the rich: he has
betrothed a lady in the [/O]ster-king's realm;[421] a heathen woman, "and
you never came into his mind," #E# 13; he is to be married to-morrow,
#K# 6. A wee swain tells her, #M# 14, 16, that he sits in Austurr['i]ki
drinking the ale of forgetfulness, and will never come home; he shall
not drink long, says she. Ellensborg asks her brother to undertake a
voyage for her; he will go with her if she will wait till summer; rather
than wait till summer she will go alone, #A#, #D#, #G#. She asks
fraternal advice about going in search of her lover, #A#, #E#, the
advice of her uncles, #I#; asks the loan of a ship, #B#, #C#, #F#, #H#,
#N#. She is told that such a thing would be a shame; she had better take
another lover; the object is not worth the trouble; the voyage is bad
for a man and worse for a woman. Her maids give her advice that is more
to her mind, #E#, but are as prudent as the rest in the later #I#. She
attires herself like a knight, clips her maids' hair, #B#, #H#, #I#,
#L#, #M#, and puts them into men's clothes, #D#, #L#; sets herself to
steer and the maids to row, #A-G#, #L#.[422]

The voyage is less than two months, #B#, #C#, #E#; less than three
months, #I#; quite three months, #L#. It is the first day of the bridal
when she lands, #B# 22, #E# 24, #N# 14; in #B# Ellensborg learns this
from a boy who is walking on the sand. Sword at side, she enters the
hall where Peter is drinking his bridal. Peter, can in hand, rises and
says, Bless your eyes, my sister's son; welcome to this strange land. In
#B# he asks, How are my father and mother? and she tells him that his
father lies dead on his bier, his mother in sick-bed. In #L#, waiting
for no greeting, she says, Well you sit at the board with your wife! Are
all lords wont thus to keep their faith? The bride's mother, #D#, #G#,
the heathen bride, #E#, an unnamed person, probably the bride, #A#, #B#,
#F#, #N#, says, That is not your sister's son, but much more like a
woman; her hair is like spun gold, and braided up under a silk cap.

#A# tells us, and so #F#, #G#, that it was two months before Ellensborg
could speak to Peter privately. Then, on a Yule day, when he was going
to church, she said, It does not occur to you that you gave me your
troth. Sir Peter stood as if women had shorn his hair, and recollected
all as if it had been yesterday. In #B-E#, #H#, #I#, #L#, #M#, #N#, this
incident has, perhaps, dropped out. In these immediately, as in #A#,
#F#, #G#, after this interview, Sir Peter, recalled to his senses or to
his fidelity, conceives the purpose of flying with Ellensborg. Good
people, he says, knights and swains, ladies and maids, follow my bride
to bed, while I take my sister's son over the meads, through the wood,
#B-E#, #H#, #I#, #N#. In #A#, #F#, Sir Peter asks the bride how long she
will bide while he takes his nephew across the kingdom; in #G# begs the
boon that, since his sister's son is going, he may ride with him, just
accompany him to the strand and take leave of him; in #L#, #M#, hopes
she will not be angry if he convoys his nephew three days on his way.
(It is at this point in #C#, #H#, #I#, #L#, that the bride says it is no
sister's son, but a woman.) The bride remarks that there are knights and
swains enow to escort his sister's son, and that he might more fitly
stay where he is, but Sir Peter persists that he will see his nephew off
in person.

Sir Peter and Ellensborg go aboard the ship, he crying, You will see me
no more! When they are at sea Ellensborg lets out her hair, #A#, #B#,
#C#, #H#; she wishes that the abandoned bride may now feel the grief
which she herself had borne for years. The proceeding is less covert in
#I#, #L#, #M# than in the other versions.

As Ellensborg and Peter are making for the ship in #D# 30, 31 (and #G#
36, 37, borrowed from #D#), she says, Tell me, Sir Peter, why would
you deceive me so? Sir Peter answers that he never meant to deceive
her; it was the lady of [/O]sterland that did it; she had changed his
mind. A magical change is meant. This agrees with what is said in
#A# 24, 25 (also #F#, #G#), that when Ellensborg got Peter alone to
herself, and said, You do not remember that you plighted your troth to
me, everything came back to him as if it had happened yesterday. And
again in the F[:a]r[:o]e copy, #L# 49, Ellensborg, from the prow, cries
to Ingibj[:o]rg on the strand, Farewell to thee with thy _elf-ways_,
vi[dh] t['i]tt elvargangi! I have taken to myself my true love that I
lent thee so long; implying that Sir Peter had been detained by Circean
arts, by a sleepy drench of ['o]minnis [:o]l, or ale of forgetfulness,
Icelandic #M# 14, which, in the light of the other ballads, is to be
understood literally, and not figuratively. The feature of a man being
made, by magical or other means, to forget a first love who had done
and suffered much for him, and being suddenly restored to consciousness
and his original predilection, is of the commonest occurrence in
traditional tales.[423]

Our English ballad affords no other positive trace of external
interference with the hero's will than the far-fetched allegation in #C#
that the choice before him was to accept a duke's daughter or forfeit
his lands. The explanation of his inconstancy in #H#, #N#, that young
men ever were fickle found, is vulgar, and also insufficient, for
Beichan returns to his old love _per saltum_, like one from whose eyes
scales have fallen and from whose back a weight has been taken, not
tamely, like a facile youth that has swerved. #E# and #K#, as already
said, distinctly recognize that Beichan was not acting with free mind,
and, for myself, I have little doubt that, if we could go back far
enough, we should find that he had all along been faithful at heart.

#Spanish.# #A.# 'El Conde Sol,' Duran, Romancero, I, 180, No 327, from
tradition in Andalusia, by the editor; Wolf and Hofmann, Primavera, II,
48, No 135. In this most beautiful romance the County Sol, named general
in great wars between Spain and Portugal, and leaving a young wife
dissolved in tears, tells her that she is free to marry if he does not
come back in six years. Six pass, and eight, and more than ten, yet the
county does not return, nor does there come news of him. His wife
implores and obtains leave of her father to go in search of her husband.
She traverses France and Italy, land and sea, and is on the point of
giving up hope, when one day she sees a herdsman pasturing cows. Whose
are these cows? she asks. The County Sol's, is the answer. And whose
these wheat-fields, these ewes, these gardens, and that palace? whose
the horses I hear neigh? The County Sol's, is the answer in each
case.[424] And who that lady that a man folds in his arms? The lady is
betrothed to him and the county is to marry her. The countess changes
her silken robe for the herdsman's sackcloth, and goes to ask an alms at
the county's gate. Beyond all hope, the county comes out himself to
bring it. "Whence comest thou, pilgrim?" he asks. She was born in Spain.
"How didst thou make thy way hither?" She came to seek her husband,
footing the thorns by land, risking the perils of the sea; and when she
found him he was about to marry, he had forgotten his faithful wife.
"Pilgrim, thou art surely the devil, come to try me." "No devil," she
said, "but thy wife indeed, and therefore come to seek thee." Upon this,
without a moment's tarrying, the county ordered his horse, took up his
wife, and made his best speed to his native castle. The bride he would
have taken remained unmarried, for those that put on others' robes are
sure to be stripped naked.

Conde Burgos made general. The countess his wife does nothing but weep.
The husband tells her to marry again if he does not come back in seven
years. More than seven years are gone, and the lady's father asks why
she does not marry. "How can I," she replies, "if the count is living?
Give me your blessing, and let me go in search of him." She goes a
hundred leagues on foot, in the disguise of a pilgrim. Arrived at a
palace she sees pages pass, and asks them for whom a horse is intended.
It is for Count Burgos's son, who marries that night. She asks to be
directed to the young count, is told that she will find him in the hall,
enters, and begs an alms, as coming from Italy and without a penny. The
young man says, If you come from Italy, what is the news? Is Conde
Bueso's wife living? The pilgrim desires some description of the lady.
It seems that she wore a very costly petticoat on her wedding-day. The
pilgrim takes off _her glove_ and shows her ring; she also takes off and
shows the expensive petticoat. There is great weeping in that palace,
for first wives never can be forgotten. Don Bueso and the pilgrim clap
hands and go home.

#Italian: Piedmontese.# #A.# 'Moran d'Inghilterra,' communicated to
Rivista Contemporanea, XXXI, 3, 1862, by Nigra, who gives the variations
of four other versions. The daughter of the sultan is so handsome that
they know not whom to give her to, but decide upon Moran of England. The
first day of his marriage he did nothing but kiss her, the second he
wished to leave her, and the third he went off to the war. "When shall
you return?" asked his wife. "If not in seven years, marry." She waited
seven years, but Moran did not come. His wife went all over England on
horseback, and came upon a cowherd. "Whose cows are these?" she asked.
They were Moran's. "Has Moran a wife?" This is the day when he is to
marry, and if she makes haste she will be in time for the wedding. She
spurs her horse, and arrives in season. They offer her to drink in a
gold cup. She will drink from no cup that is not her own; she will not
drink while another woman is there; she will not drink till she is
mistress. Moran throws his arms round her neck, saying, Mistress you
ever have been and still shall be.

love with the princess, for which the king sent him off. The lady
knocked at his door, and asked when he would come back. In seven years,
was the answer, and if not she was to marry. The princess stole a
hundred scudi from her father, frizzled her hair French fashion, bought
a fashionable suit, and rode three days and nights without touching
ground, eating, or drinking. She came upon a laundryman, and asked who
was in command there. Murando. She knocked at the door, and Murando
asked, Have you come to our wedding? She would come to the dance. At the
dance she was recognized by the servants. Murando asked, How came you
here? "I rode three days and three nights without touching ground,
eating, or drinking." This is my wife, said Murando; and the other lady
he bade return to her father.

It is possible that this ballad may formerly have been known in France.
Nothing is left and known that shows this conclusively, but there is an
approach to the Norse form in a fragment which occurs in several widely
separated localities. A lover goes off in November, promising his love
to return in December, but does not. A messenger comes to bid the lady,
in his name, seek another lover, for he has another love. "Is she fairer
than I, or more powerful?" She is not fairer, but more powerful: she
makes rosemary flower on the edge of her sleeve, changes the sea into
wine and fish into flesh. Bujeaud, I, 203. In 'La Femme Abandonn['e]e,'
Puymaigre, I, 72, the lover is married to a Fleming:

    Elle fait venir le soleil
    A minuit dans sa chambre,
    Elle fait bouiller la marmite
    Sans feu et sans rente.

In a Canadian version, 'Entre Paris et Saint-Denis,' Gagnon, p. 303, the
deserted woman is a king's daughter, and the new love,

    Ell' fait neiger, ell' fait gr[^e]ler,
    Ell' fait le vent qui vente.
    Ell' fait reluire le soleil
    A minuit dans sa chambre.
    Ell' fait pousser le romarin
    Sur le bord de la manche.

Puymaigre notes that there is a version very near to the Canadian in the
sixth volume of Po['e]sies populaires de la France, cinqui[e']me recueil,
Ardennes, No 2.[425]

A broadside ballad, 'The Turkish Lady,' 'The Turkish Lady and the
English Slave,' printed in Logan's Pedlar's Pack, p. 16, Christie, I,
247, from singing, and preserved also in the Kinloch MSS, V, 53, I, 263,
from Elizabeth Beattie's recitation, simply relates how a Turkish
pirate's daughter fell in love with an Englishman, her slave, offered to
release him if he would turn Turk, but chose the better part of flying
with him to Bristol, and becoming herself a Christian brave.

Sir William Stanley, passing through Constantinople, is condemned to die
for his religion. A lady, walking under the prison walls, hears his
lament, and begs his life of the Turk. She would make him her husband,
and bring him to adore Mahomet. She offers to set the prisoner free if
he will marry her, but he has a wife and children on English ground. The
lady is sorry, but generously gives Stanley five hundred pounds to carry
him to his own country. Sir William Stanley's Garland, Halliwell's
Palatine Anthology, pp 277 f.

Two Magyars have been shut up in a dungeon by the sultan, and have not
seen sun, moon, or stars for seven years. The sultan's daughter hears
their moan, and offers to free them if they will take her to Hungary.
This they promise to do. She gets the keys, takes money, opens the
doors, and the three make off. They are followed; one of the Magyars
kills all the pursuers but one, who is left to carry back the news. It
is now proposed that there shall be a duel to determine who shall have
the lady. She begs them rather to cut off her head than to fight about
her. Szil['a]gyi Niklas says he has a love at home, and leaves the sultan's
daughter to his comrade, Hagym['a]si L['a]szl['o]. Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, p. 93: see p. 107 of this volume.

    1
    In London city was Bicham born,
      He longd strange countries for to see,
    But he was taen by a savage Moor,
      Who handld him right cruely.

    2
    For thro his shoulder he put a bore,
      An thro the bore has pitten a tree,
    An he's gard him draw the carts o wine,
      Where horse and oxen had wont to be.

    3
    He's casten [him] in a dungeon deep,
      Where he coud neither hear nor see;
    He's shut him up in a prison strong,
      An he's handld him right cruely.

    4
    O this Moor he had but ae daughter,
      I wot her name was Shusy Pye;
    She's doen her to the prison-house,
      And she's calld Young Bicham one word by.

    5
    'O hae ye ony lands or rents,
      Or citys in your ain country,
    Coud free you out of prison strong,
      An coud mantain a lady free?'

    6
    'O London city is my own,
      An other citys twa or three,
    Coud loose me out o prison strong,
      An coud mantain a lady free.'

    7
    O she has bribed her father's men
      Wi meikle goud and white money,
    She's gotten the key o the prison doors,
      An she has set Young Bicham free.

    8
    She's gi'n him a loaf o good white bread,
      But an a flask o Spanish wine,
    An she bad him mind on the ladie's love
      That sae kindly freed him out o pine.

    9
    'Go set your foot on good ship-board,
      An haste you back to your ain country,
    An before that seven years has an end,
      Come back again, love, and marry me.'

    10
    It was long or seven years had an end
      She longd fu sair her love to see;
    She's set her foot on good ship-board,
      An turnd her back on her ain country.

    11
    She's saild up, so has she doun,
      Till she came to the other side;
    She's landed at Young Bicham's gates,
      An I hop this day she sal be his bride.

    12
    'Is this Young Bicham's gates?' says she,
      'Or is that noble prince within?'
    'He's up the stairs wi his bonny bride,
      An monny a lord and lady wi him.'

    13
    'O has he taen a bonny bride,
      An has he clean forgotten me!'
    An sighing said that gay lady,
      I wish I were in my ain country!

    14
    But she's pitten her han in her pocket,
      An gin the porter guineas three;
    Says, Take ye that, ye proud porter,
      An bid the bridegroom speak to me.

    15
    O whan the porter came up the stair,
      He's fa'n low down upon his knee:
    'Won up, won up, ye proud porter,
      An what makes a' this courtesy?'

    16
    'O I've been porter at your gates
      This mair nor seven years an three,
    But there is a lady at them now
      The like of whom I never did see.

    17
    'For on every finger she has a ring,
      An on the mid-finger she has three,
    An there's as meikle goud aboon her brow
      As woud buy an earldome o lan to me.'

    18
    Then up it started Young Bicham,
      An sware so loud by Our Lady,
    'It can be nane but Shusy Pye,
      That has come oer the sea to me.'

    19
    O quickly ran he down the stair,
      O fifteen steps he has made but three;
    He's tane his bonny love in his arms,
      An a wot he kissd her tenderly.

    20
    'O hae you tane a bonny bride?
      An hae you quite forsaken me?
    An hae ye quite forgotten her
      That gae you life an liberty?'

    21
    She's lookit oer her left shoulder
      To hide the tears stood in her ee;
    'Now fare thee well, Young Bicham,' she says,
     'I'll strive to think nae mair on thee.'

    22
    'Take back your daughter, madam,' he says,
      'An a double dowry I'll gi her wi;
    For I maun marry my first true love,
      That's done and suffered so much for me.'

    23
    He's take his bonny love by the han,
      And led her to yon fountain stane;
    He's changd her name frae Shusy Pye,
      An he's cald her his bonny love, Lady Jane.

    Thro evry shoulder they bord a bore,

    'Is there neer an auld wife in this town

    A Savoyen has an only daughter,

    'O lady, Lundin it is mine,
      And other castles twa or three;
    These I wad gie to a lady fair
      That out of prison wad set me free.'

    8
    She's taen him by the milk-white hand,
      And led him to a towr sae hie,
    She's made him drink the wine sae reid,
      And sung to him like a mavosie.

    9
    O these two luvers made a bond,
      For seven years, and that is lang,
    That he was to marry no other wife,
      And she's to marry no other man.

    10
    When seven years were past and gane,
      This young lady began to lang,
    And she's awa to Lundin gane,
      To see if Brechin's got safe to land.

    11
    When she came to Young Brechin's yett,
      She chappit gently at the gin;
    'Is this Young Brechin's yett?' she says,
      'Or is this lusty lord within?'
    'O yes, this is Lord Brechin's yett,
      And I wat this be his bridal een.'

    12
    She's put her hand in her pocket,
      And thrawin the porter guineas three;
    'Gang up the stair, young man,' she says,
      'And bid your master come down to me.

    13
    'Bid him bring a bite o his ae best bread,
      And a bottle o his ae best wine,
    And neer forget that lady fair
      That did him out o prison bring.'

    14
    The porter tripped up the stair,
      And fell low down upon his knee:
    'Rise up, rise up, ye proud porter,
      What mean you by this courtesie?'

    15
    'O I hae been porter at your yett
      This thirty years and a' but three;
    There stands the fairest lady thereat
      That ever my twa een did see.

    16
    'On evry finger she has a ring,
      On her mid-finger she has three;

    He's taen the table wi his foot,

    But the fairest day that eer ye saw,

    21
    O when these lovers two did meet,
      The tear it blinded baith their ee;
    'Gie me my faith and troth,' she says,
      'For now fain hame wad I be.'

      As ever saild the sea;
    An he's doen him to the court of France,
      To serve for meat and fee.

    2
    He had nae been i the court of France

    'Win up, my proud porter,
      What is your will wi me?'

    20
    'I hae been porter at yer gate

    21
    Out spak the bride's mither,
      An a haghty woman was she:
    'If ye had na eccepted the bonny bride,
      Ye might well ha eccepted me.'

    22
    'No disparagement to you, madam,
      Nor none unto her Grace;
    The sole of your lady's foot
      Is fairer than her face.'

    23
    He's gaen the table wi his foot,

      'T is Susie Pay, come oer the sea.'

    24

    25
    'Gie me a shive of your white bread,

   |   1
   |   In London was Young Beichan born,
   |     He longed strange countries for to see,
   |   But he was taen by a savage Moor,
   |     Who handled him right cruellie.

     2
     For he viewed the fashions of that land,
       Their way of worship viewed he,
     But to Mahound or Termagant
       Would Beichan never bend a knee.

   |   3
   |   So in every shoulder they've putten a bore,
   |     In every bore they've putten a tree,
   |   And they have made him trail the wine
   |     And spices on his fair bodie.

   |   4
   |   They've casten him in a dungeon deep,
   |     Where he could neither hear nor see,
   |   For seven years they kept him there,
   |     Till he for hunger's like to die.

   |   5
   |   This Moor he had but ae daughter,
   |     Her name was called Susie Pye,
   |   And every day as she took the air,
   |     Near Beichan's prison she passed by.

    6
    O so it fell upon a day
      She heard Young Beichan sadly sing:
    'My hounds they all go masterless,
      My hawks they flee from tree to tree,
    My younger brother will heir my land,
      Fair England again I'll never see!'

    7
    All night long no rest she got,
      Young Beichan's song for thinking on;
    She's stown the keys from her father's head,
      And to the prison strong is gone.

    8
    And she has opend the prison doors,
      I wot she opend two or three,
    Ere she could come Young Beichan at,
      He was locked up so curiouslie.

    9
    But when she came Young Beichan before,
      Sore wonderd he that may to see;
    He took her for some fair captive:
      'Fair Lady, I pray, of what countrie?'

    10
    'O have ye any lands,' she said,
      'Or castles in your own countrie,
    That ye could give to a lady fair,
      From prison strong to set you free?'

    11
    'Near London town I have a hall,
      With other castles two or three;
    I'll give them all to the lady fair
      That out of prison will set me free.'

    12
    'Give me the truth of your right hand,
      The truth of it give unto me,
    That for seven years ye'll no lady wed,
      Unless it be along with me.'

    13
    'I'll give thee the truth of my right hand,
      The truth of it I'll freely gie,
    That for seven years I'll stay unwed,
      For the kindness thou dost show to me.'

   |   14
   |   And she has brib'd the proud warder
   |     Wi mickle gold and white monie,
   |   She's gotten the keys of the prison strong,
   |     And she has set Young Beichan free.

   |   15
   |   She's gien him to eat the good spice-cake,
   |     She's gien him to drink the blood-red wine,
   |   She's bidden him sometimes think on her,
   |     That sae kindly freed him out of pine.

    16
    She's broken a ring from her finger,
      And to Beichan half of it gave she:
    'Keep it, to mind you of that love
      The lady bore that set you free.

   |   17
   |   'And set your foot on good ship-board,
   |     And haste ye back to your own countrie,
   |   And before that seven years have an end,
   |     Come back again, love, and marry me.'

   |   18
   |   But long ere seven years had an end,
   |     She longd full sore her love to see,
    For ever a voice within her breast
      Said, 'Beichan has broke his vow to thee:'
   |   So she's set her foot on good ship-board,
   |     And turnd her back on her own countrie.

    19
    She sailed east, she sailed west,
      Till to fair England's shore she came,
    Where a bonny shepherd she espied,
      Feeding his sheep upon the plain.

    20
    'What news, what news, thou bonny shepherd?
      What news hast thou to tell to me?'
    'Such news I hear, ladie,' he says,
      'The like was never in this countrie.

    21
    'There is a wedding in yonder hall,
      Has lasted these thirty days and three;
    Young Beichan will not bed with his bride,
      For love of one that's yond the sea.'

    22
    She's put her hand in her pocket,
      Gien him the gold and white monie:
    'Hae, take ye that, my bonny boy,
      For the good news thou tellst to me.'

    23
    When she came to Young Beichan's gate,
      She tirled softly at the pin;
    So ready was the proud porter
      To open and let this lady in.

   |   24
   |   'Is this Young Beichan's hall,' she said,
   |     'Or is that noble lord within?'
   |   'Yea, he's in the hall among them all,
   |     And this is the day o his weddin.'

   |   25
   |   'And has he wed anither love?
   |     And has he clean forgotten me?'
   |   And sighin said that gay ladie,
   |     I wish I were in my own countrie!

   |   26
   |   And she has taen her gay gold ring,
   |     That with her love she brake so free;
   |   Says, Gie him that, ye proud porter,
   |     And bid the bridegroom speak to me.

   |   27
   |   When the porter came his lord before,
   |     He kneeled down low on his knee:
   |   'What aileth thee, my proud porter,
   |     Thou art so full of courtesie?'

   |   28
   |   'I've been porter at your gates,
   |     It's thirty long years now and three;
   |   But there stands a lady at them now,
   |     The like o her did I never see.

   |   29
   |   'For on every finger she has a ring,
   |     And on her mid-finger she has three,
   |   And as meickle gold aboon her brow
   |     As would buy an earldom to me.'

    30
    It's out then spak the bride's mother,
      Aye and an angry woman was shee:
    'Ye might have excepted our bonny bride,
      And twa or three of our companie.'

    31
    'O hold your tongue, thou bride's mother,
      Of all your folly let me be;
    She's ten times fairer nor the bride,
      And all that's in your companie.

    32
    'She begs one sheave of your white bread,
      But and a cup of your red wine,
    And to remember the lady's love
      That last relievd you out of pine.'

    33
    'O well-a-day!' said Beichan then,
      'That I so soon have married thee!
   |   For it can be none but Susie Pye,
   |     That sailed the sea for love of me.'

   |   34
   |   And quickly hied he down the stair;
   |     Of fifteen steps he made but three;
   |   He's taen his bonny love in his arms,
   |     And kist and kist her tenderlie.

   |   35
   |   'O hae ye taen anither bride?
   |     And hae ye quite forgotten me?
   |   And hae ye quite forgotten her
   |     That gave you life and libertie?'

    36
    She looked oer her left shoulder,
      To hide the tears stood in her ee:
    'Now fare thee well, Young Beichan,' she says,
      'I'll try to think no more on thee.'

    37
    'O never, never, Susie Pye,
      For surely this can never be,
    Nor ever shall I wed but her
      That's done and dreed so much for me.'

    38
    Then out and spak the forenoon bride:
      'My lord, your love it changeth soon;
    This morning I was made your bride,
      And another chose ere it be noon.'

    39
    O hold thy tongue, thou forenoon bride,
      Ye're neer a whit the worse for me,
    And whan ye return to your own countrie,
      A double dower I'll send with thee.'

    40
    He's taen Susie Pye by the white hand,
      And gently led her up and down,
    And ay as he kist her red rosy lips,
      'Ye're welcome, jewel, to your own.'

   |   41
   |   He's taen her by the milk-white hand,
   |     And led her to yon fountain stane;
   |   He's changed her name from Susie Pye,
   |     And he's call'd her his bonny love, Lady Jane.

        Widow Stevenson, aged seventy-three: "East Country."

    1
    In the lands where Lord Beichan was born,
      Amang the stately steps of stane,
    He wore the goud at his left shoulder,
      But to the Holy Land he's gane.

    2
    He was na lang in the Holy Land,
      Amang the Prudents that was black,
    He was na lang in the Holy Land,
      Till the Prudent did Lord Beichan tak.

    3
    The gard him draw baith pleugh and harrow,
      And horse and oxen twa or three;
    They cast him in a dark dungeon,
      Whare he coud neither hear nor see.

    4
    The Prudent had a fair daughter,
      I wot they ca'd her Susy Pye,
    And all the keys in that city
      Hang at that lady by and bye.

    5
    It once fell out upon a day
      That into the prison she did gae,
    And whan she cam to the prison door,
      She kneeled low down on her knee.

    6
    'O hae ye ony lands, Beichan,
      Or hae ye ony castles hie,
    Whar ye wad tak a young thing to,
      If out of prison I wad let thee?'

    7
    'Fair London's mine, dear lady,' he said,
      'And other places twa or three,
    Whar I wad tak a young thing to,
      If out of prison ye wad let me.'

    8
    O she has opened the prison door,
      And other places twa or three,
    And gien him bread, and wine to drink,
      In her own chamber privately.

    9
    O then she built a bonny ship,
      And she has set it on the main,
    And she has built a bonny ship,
      It's for to tak Lord Beichan hame.

    10
    O she's gaen murning up and down,
      And she's gaen murnin to the sea,
    Then to her father she has gane in,
      Wha spak to her right angrily.

    11
    'O do ye mourn for the goud, daughter,
      Or do ye mourn for the whyte monie?
    Or do ye mourn for the English squire?
      I wat I will gar hang him hie.'

    12
    'I neither mourn for the goud, father,
      Nor do I for the whyte monie,
    Nor do I for the English squire;
      And I care na tho ye hang him hie.

    13
    'But I hae promised an errand to go,
      Seven lang miles ayont the sea,
    And blythe and merry I never will be
      Untill that errand you let me.'

    14
    'That errand, daughter, you may gang,
      Seven long miles beyond the sea,
    Since blythe and merry you'll neer be
      Untill that errand I'll let thee.'

    15
    O she has built a bonny ship,
      And she has set it in the sea,
    And she has built a bonny ship,
      It's all for to tak her a long journie.

    16
    And she's sailed a' the summer day,
      I wat the wind blew wondrous fair;
    In sight of fair London she has come,
      And till Lord Beichan's yett she walked.

    17
    Whan she cam till Lord Beichan's yett,
      She rappit loudly at the pin:
    'Is Beichan lord of this bonny place?
      I pray ye open and let me in.

    18
    'And O is this Lord Beichan's yett,
      And is the noble lord within?'
    'O yes, it is Lord Beichan's yett,
      He's wi his bride and mony a ane.'

    19
    'If you'll gang up to Lord Beichan,
      Tell him the words that I tell thee;
    It will put him in mind of Susy Pye,
      And the Holy Land, whareer he be.

    20
    'Tell him to send one bite of bread,
      It's and a glass of his gude red wine,
    Nor to forget the lady's love
      That loosed him out of prison strong.'

      I'm sure this therty lang years and three,
    But the fairest lady stands thereat
      That evir my twa eyes did see.

    22
    'On ilka finger she has a ring,
      And on the foremost she has three;
    As muckle goud is on her head
      As wad buy an earldom of land to thee.

    23
    'She bids you send a bite of bread,
      It's and a glass of your gude red wine,
    Nor to forget the lady's love
      That let you out of prison strong.'

    24
    It's up and spak the bride's mother,
      A weight of goud hung at her chin:
    'There is no one so fair without
      But there are, I wat, as fair within.'

    25
    It's up and spak the bride hersel,
      As she sat by the gude lord's knee:
    'Awa, awa, ye proud porter,
      This day ye might hae excepted me.'

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    27
    'Awa, awa, ye proud mither,
      It's tak your daughter fair frae me;
    For I brought her home with chariots six,
      And I'll send her back wi coaches three.'

    28
    It's he's taen the table wi his fit,
      And syne he took it wi his knee;
    He gard the glasses and wine so red,
      He gard them all in flinders flee.

    29
    O he's gane down the steps of stairs,
      And a' the stately steps of stane,
    Until he cam to Susy Pye;
      I wat the tears blinded baith their eyne.

    30
    He led her up the steps of stairs,
      And a' the stately steps of stane,
    And changed her name from Susy Pye,
      And ca'd her lusty Lady Jane.

    31
    'O fye, gar cooks mak ready meat,
      O fye, gar cooks the pots supply,

    Young Beichan was in London born,
      He was a man of hie degree;
    He past thro monie kingdoms great,
      Until he cam unto Grand Turkie.

    2
    He viewd the fashions of that land,
      Their way of worship viewed he,
    But unto onie of their stocks
      He wadna sae much as bow a knee:

    3
    Which made him to be taken straight,
      And brought afore their hie jurie;
    The savage Moor did speak upricht,
      And made him meikle ill to dree.

    4
    In ilka shoulder they've bord a hole,
      And in ilka hole they've put a tree;
    They've made him to draw carts and wains,
      Till he was sick and like to dee.

    5
    But Young Beichan was a Christian born,
      And still a Christian was he;
    Which made them put him in prison strang,
      And cauld and hunger sair to dree,
    And fed on nocht but bread and water,
      Until the day that he mot dee.

    6
    In this prison there grew a tree,
      And it was unco stout and strang,
    Where he was chained by the middle,
      Until his life was almaist gane.

    7
    The savage Moor had but ae dochter,
      And her name it was Susie Pye,
    And ilka day as she took the air,
      The prison door she passed bye.

    8
    But it fell ance upon a day,
      As she was walking, she heard him sing;
    She listend to his tale of woe,
      A happy day for Young Beichan!

    9
    'My hounds they all go masterless,
      My hawks they flee frae tree to tree,
    My youngest brother will heir my lands,
      My native land I'll never see.'

    10
    'O were I but the prison-keeper,
      As I'm a ladie o hie degree,
    I soon wad set this youth at large,
      And send him to his ain countrie.'

    11
    She went away into her chamber,
      All nicht she never closd her ee;
    And when the morning begoud to dawn,
      At the prison door alane was she.

    12
    She gied the keeper a piece of gowd,
      And monie pieces o white monie,
    To tak her thro the bolts and bars,
      The lord frae Scotland she langd to see;
    She saw young Beichan at the stake,
      Which made her weep maist bitterlie.

    13
    'O hae ye got onie lands,' she says,
      'Or castles in your ain countrie?
    It's what wad ye gie to the ladie fair
      Wha out o prison wad set you free?'

    14
    'It's I hae houses, and I hae lands,
      Wi monie castles fair to see,
    And I wad gie a' to that ladie gay,
      Wha out o prison wad set me free.'

    15
    The keeper syne brak aff his chains,
      And set Lord Beichan at libertie;
    She filld his pockets baith wi gowd,
      To tak him till his ain countrie.

    16
    She took him frae her father's prison,
      And gied to him the best o wine,
    And a brave health she drank to him:
      'I wish, Lord Beichan, ye were mine!

    17
    'It's seven lang years I'll mak a vow,
      And seven lang years I'll keep it true;
    If ye'll wed wi na ither woman,
      It's I will wed na man but you.'

    18
    She's tane him to her father's port,
      And gien to him a ship o fame:
    'Farewell, farewell, my Scottish lord,
      I fear I'll neer see you again.'

    19
    Lord Beichan turnd him round about,
      And lowly, lowly loutit he:
    'Ere seven lang years come to an end,
      I'll tak you to mine ain countrie.'

    20
    Then whan he cam to Glasgow town,
      A happy, happy man was he;
    The ladies a' around him thrangd,
      To see him come frae slaverie.

    21
    His mother she had died o sorrow,
      And a' his brothers were dead but he;
    His lands they a' were lying waste,
      In ruins were his castles free.

    22
    Na porter there stood at his yett,
      Na human creature he could see,
    Except the screeching owls and bats,
      Had he to bear him companie.

    23
    But gowd will gar the castles grow,
      And he had gowd and jewels free,
    And soon the pages around him thrangd,
      To serve him on their bended knee.

    24
    His hall was hung wi silk and satin,
      His table rung wi mirth and glee,
    He soon forgot the lady fair
      That lowsd him out o slaverie.

    25
    Lord Beichan courted a lady gay,
      To heir wi him his lands sae free,
    Neer thinking that a lady fair
      Was on her way frae Grand Turkie.

    26
    For Susie Pye could get na rest,
      Nor day nor nicht could happy be,
    Still thinking on the Scottish lord,
      Till she was sick and like to dee.

    27
    But she has builded a bonnie ship,
      Weel mannd wi seamen o hie degree,
    And secretly she stept on board,
      And bid adieu to her ain countrie.

    28
    But whan she cam to the Scottish shore,
      The bells were ringing sae merrilie;
    It was Lord Beichan's wedding day,
      Wi a lady fair o hie degree.

    29
    But sic a vessel was never seen;
      The very masts were tappd wi gold,
    Her sails were made o the satin fine,
      Maist beautiful for to behold.

    30
    But whan the lady cam on shore,
      Attended wi her pages three,
    Her shoon were of the beaten gowd,
      And she a lady of great beautie.

    31
    Then to the skipper she did say,
      'Can ye this answer gie to me?
    Where are Lord Beichan's lands sae braid?
      He surely lives in this countrie.'

    32
    Then up bespak the skipper bold,
      For he could speak the Turkish tongue:
    'Lord Beichan lives not far away;
      This is the day of his wedding.'

    33
    'If ye will guide me to Beichan's yetts,
      I will ye well reward,' said she;
    Then she and all her pages went,
      A very gallant companie.

    34
    When she cam to Lord Beichan's yetts,
      She tirld gently at the pin;
    Sae ready was the proud porter
      To let the wedding guests come in.

    35
    'Is this Lord Beichan's house,' she says,
      'Or is that noble lord within?'
    'Yes, he is gane into the hall,
      With his brave bride and monie ane.'

    36
    'Ye'll bid him send me a piece of bread,
      Bot and a cup of his best wine;
    And bid him mind the lady's love
      That ance did lowse him out o pyne.'

    37
    Then in and cam the porter bold,
      I wat he gae three shouts and three:
    'The fairest lady stands at your yetts
      That ever my twa een did see.'

    38
    Then up bespak the bride's mither,
      I wat an angry woman was she:
    'You micht hae excepted our bonnie bride,
      Tho she'd been three times as fair as she.'

    39
    'My dame, your daughter's fair enough,
      And aye the fairer mot she be!
    But the fairest time that eer she was,
      She'll na compare wi this ladie.

    40
    'She has a gowd ring on ilka finger,
      And on her mid-finger she has three;
    She has as meikle gowd upon her head
      As wad buy an earldom o land to thee.

    41
    'My lord, she begs some o your bread,
      Bot and a cup o your best wine,
    And bids you mind the lady's love
      That ance did lowse ye out o pyne.'

    42
    Then up and started Lord Beichan,
      I wat he made the table flee:
    'I wad gie a' my yearlie rent
    'T were Susie Pye come owre the sea.'

    43
    Syne up bespak the bride's mother,
      She was never heard to speak sae free:
    'Ye'll no forsake my ae dochter,
      Tho Susie Pye has crossd the sea?'

    44
    'Tak hame, tak hame, your dochter, madam,
      For she is neer the waur o me;
    She cam to me on horseback riding,
      And she sall gang hame in chariot free.'

    45
    He's tane Susie Pye by the milk-white hand,
      And led her thro his halls sae hie:
    'Ye're now Lord Beichan's lawful wife,
      And thrice ye're welcome unto me.'

    46
    Lord Beichan prepard for another wedding,
      Wi baith their hearts sae fu o glee;
    Says, 'I'll range na mair in foreign lands,
      Sin Susie Pye has crossd the sea.

    47
    'Fy! gar a' our cooks mak ready,
      And fy! gar a' our pipers play,
    And fy! gar trumpets gae thro the toun,
      That Lord Beichan's wedded twice in a day!'

    In London was Young Bechin born,
      Foreign nations he longed to see;
    He passed through many kingdoms great,
      At length he came unto Turkie.

    2
    He viewed the fashions of that land,
      The ways of worship viewed he,
    But unto any of their gods
      He would not so much as bow the knee.

    3
    On every shoulder they made a bore,
      In every bore they put a tree,
    Then they made him the winepress tread,
      And all in spite of his fair bodie.

    4
    They put him into a deep dungeon,
      Where he could neither hear nor see,
    And for seven years they kept him there,
      Till for hunger he was like to die.

    5
    Stephen, their king, had a daughter fair,
      Yet never a man to her came nigh;
    And every day she took the air,
      Near to his prison she passed by.

    6
    One day she heard Young Bechin sing
      A song that pleased her so well,
    No rest she got till she came to him,
      All in his lonely prison cell.

    7
    'I have a hall in London town,
      With other buildings two or three,
    And I'll give them all to the ladye fair
      That from this dungeon shall set me free.'

    8
    She stole the keys from her dad's head,
      And if she oped one door ay she opened three,
    Till she Young Bechin could find out,
      He was locked up so curiouslie.

        The Loving Ballad of Lord Bateman. Illustrated by George
        Cruikshank. 1839.

    1
    Lord Bateman was a noble lord,
      A noble lord of high degree;
    He shipped himself all aboard of a ship,
      Some foreign country for to see.

    2
    He sailed east, he sailed west,
      Until he came to famed Turkey,
    Where he was taken and put to prison,
      Until his life was quite weary.

    3
    All in this prison there grew a tree,
      O there it grew so stout and strong!
    Where he was chained all by the middle,
      Until his life was almost gone.

    4
    This Turk he had one only daughter,
      The fairest my two eyes eer see;
    She steel the keys of her father's prison,
      And swore Lord Bateman she would let go free.

    5
    O she took him to her father's cellar,
      And gave to him the best of wine;
    And every health she drank unto him
      Was, 'I wish, Lord Bateman, as you was mine.'

    6
    'O have you got houses, have you got land,
      And does Northumberland belong to thee?
    And what would you give to the fair young lady
      As out of prison would let you go free?'

    7
    'O I've got houses and I've got land,
    And half Northumberland belongs to me;
    And I will give it all to the fair young lady
    As out of prison would let me go free.'

    8
    'O in seven long years, I'll make a vow
      For seven long years, and keep it strong,
    That if you'll wed no other woman,
      O I will wed no other man.'

    9
    O she took him to her father's harbor,
      And gave to him a ship of fame,
    Saying, Farewell, farewell to you, Lord Bateman,
      I fear I never shall see you again.

    10
    Now seven long years is gone and past,
      And fourteen days, well known to me;
    She packed up all her gay clothing,
      And swore Lord Bateman she would go see.

    11
    O when she arrived at Lord Bateman's castle,
      How boldly then she rang the bell!
    'Who's there? who's there?' cries the proud young porter,
      'O come unto me pray quickly tell.'

    12
    'O is this here Lord Bateman's castle,
      And is his lordship here within?'
    'O yes, O yes,' cries the proud young porter,
      'He's just now taking his young bride in.'

    13
    'O bid him to send me a slice of bread,
      And a bottle of the very best wine,
    And not forgetting the fair young lady
      As did release him when close confine.'

    14
    O away and away went this proud young porter,
      O away and away and away went he,
    Until he come to Lord Bateman's chamber,
      When he went down on his bended knee.

    15
    'What news, what news, my proud young porter?
      What news, what news? Come tell to me:'
    'O there is the fairest young lady
      As ever my two eyes did see.

    16
    'She has got rings on every finger,
      And on one finger she has got three;
    With as much gay gold about her middle
      As would buy half Northumberlee.

    17
    'O she bids you to send her a slice of bread,
      And a bottle of the very best wine,
    And not forgetting the fair young lady
      As did release you when close confine.'

    18
    Lord Bateman then in passion flew,
      And broke his sword in splinters three,
    Saying, I will give half of my father's land,
      If so be as Sophia has crossed the sea.

    19
    Then up and spoke this young bride's mother,
      Who never was heard to speak so free;
    Saying, You'll not forget my only daughter,
      If so be as Sophia has crossed the sea.

    20
    'O it's true I made a bride of your daughter,
      But she's neither the better nor the worse for me;
    She came to me with a horse and saddle,
      But she may go home in a coach and three.'

    21
    Lord Bateman then prepared another marriage,
      With both their hearts so full of glee,
    Saying, I will roam no more to foreign countries,
      Now that Sophia has crossed the sea.

   |   Up starts a woman, clad in green,
   |     And stood at her bed-feet.

   |   16
   |   'Win up, win up, Dame Essels,' she says,
   |     'This day ye sleep ower lang;
   |   The morn is the squire's wedding day,
   |     In the bonny towers o Linne.

   |   17
   |   'Ye'll dress yoursell in the robes o green,
   |     Your maids in robes sae fair,
   |   And ye'll put girdles about their middles,
   |     Sae costly, rich and rare.

   |   18
   |   'Ye'll take your maries alang wi you,
   |     Till ye come to yon strand;
   |   There ye'll see a ship, wi sails all up,
   |     Come sailing to dry land.

   |   19
   |   'Ye'll take a wand into your hand,
   |     Ye'll stroke her round about,
   |   And ye'll take God your pilot to be,
   |     To drown ye'll take nae doubt.'

   |   20
   |   Then up it raise her Dame Essels,
   |     Sought water to wash her hands,
   |   But aye the faster that she washd,
   |     The tears they trickling ran.

   |   21
   |   Then in it came her father dear,
   |     And in the floor steps he:
   |   'What ails Dame Essels, my daughter dear,
   |     Ye weep sae bitterlie?

   |   22
   |   'Want ye a small fish frae the flood,
   |     Or turtle frae the sea?
   |   Or is there man in a' my realm
   |     This day has offended thee?'

   |   23
   |   'I want nae small fish frae the flood,
   |     Nor turtle frae the sea;
   |   But Young Bondwell, your ain prisoner,
   |     This day has offended me.'

   |   24
   |   Her father turnd him round about,
   |     A solemn oath sware he:
   |   'If this be true ye tell me now
   |     High hanged he shall be.

   |   25
   |   'To-morrow morning he shall be
   |     Hung high upon a tree:'
   |   Dame Essels whisperd to hersel,
   |     'Father, ye've made a lie.'

   |   26
   |   She dressd hersel in robes o green,
   |     Her maids in robes sae fair,
   |   Wi gowden girdles round their middles,
   |     Sae costly, rich and rare.

   |   27
   |   She's taen her mantle her about,
   |     A maiden in every hand;
   |   They saw a ship, wi sails a' up,
   |     Come sailing to dry land.

   |   28
   |   She's taen a wand intill her hand,
   |     And stroked her round about,
   |   And she's taen God her pilot to be,
   |     To drown she took nae doubt.

   |   29
   |   So they saild on, and further on,
   |     Till to the water o Tay;
   |   There they spied a bonny little boy,
   |     Was watering his steeds sae gay.

   |   30
   |   'What news, what news, my little boy,
   |     What news hae ye to me?
   |   Are there any weddings in this place,
   |     Or any gaun to be?'

   |   31
   |   'There is a wedding in this place,
   |     A wedding very soon;
   |   The morn's the young squire's wedding day,
   |     In the bonny towers of Linne.'

   |   32
   |   O then she walked alang the way
   |     To see what coud be seen,
   |   And there she saw the proud porter,
   |     Drest in a mantle green.

   |   33
   |   'What news, what news, porter?' she said,
   |     'What news hae ye to me?
   |   Are there any weddings in this place,
   |     Or any gaun to be?'

   |   34
   |   'There is a wedding in this place,
   |     A wedding very soon;
   |   The morn is Young Bondwell's wedding day,
   |     The bonny squire o Linne.'

   |   35
   |   'Gae to your master, porter,' she said,
   |     'Gae ye right speedilie;
   |   Bid him come and speak wi a maid
   |     That wishes his face to see.'

   |   36
   |   The porter's up to his master gane,
   |     Fell low down on his knee;
   |   'Win up, win up, my porter,' he said,
   |     'Why bow ye low to me?'

   |   37
   |   'I hae been porter at your yetts
   |     These thirty years and three,
   |   But fairer maids than's at them now
   |     My eyes did never see.

   |   38
   |   'The foremost she is drest in green,
   |     The rest in fine attire,
   |   Wi gowden girdles round their middles,
   |     Well worth a sheriff's hire.'

   |   39
   |   Then out it speaks Bondwell's own bride,
   |     Was a' gowd to the chin;
   |   'They canno be fairer thereout,' she says,
   |     'Than we that are therein.'

   |   40
   |   'There is a difference, my dame,' he said,
   |     ''Tween that ladye's colour and yours;
   |   As much difference as you were a stock,
   |     She o the lily flowers.'

   |   41
   |   Then out it speaks him Young Bondwell,
   |     An angry man was he:
   |   'Cast up the yetts baith wide an braid,
   |     These ladies I may see.'

   |   42
   |   Quickly up stairs Dame Essel's gane,
   |     Her maidens next her wi;
   |   Then said the bride, This lady's face
   |     Shows the porter's tauld nae lie.

   |   43
   |   The lady unto Bondwell spake,
   |     These words pronounced she:
   |   O hearken, hearken, fause Bondwell,
   |     These words that I tell thee.

   |   44
   |   Is this the way ye keep your vows
   |     That ye did make to me,
   |   When your feet were in iron fetters,
   |     Ae foot ye coudna flee?

   |   45
   |   I stole the keys o the jail-house door
   |     Frae under the bed they lay,
   |   And opend up the jail-house door,
   |     Set you at liberty.

   |   46
   |   Gae you a steed was swift in need,
   |     A saddle o royal ben,
   |   A hunder pund o pennies round,
   |     Bade you gae rove an spend.

   |   47
   |   A couple o hounds o ae litter,
   |     Cain they ca'ed the ane,
   |   Twa gay gos-hawks as swift's eer flew,
   |     To keep you onthought lang.

   |   48
   |   But since this day ye've broke your vow,
   |     For which ye're sair to blame,
   |   And since nae mair I'll get o you,
   |     O Cain, will ye gae hame?

   |   49
   |   'O Cain! O Cain!' the lady cried,
   |     And Cain did her ken;
   |   They baith flappd round the lady's knee,
   |     Like a couple o armed men.

   |   50
   |   He's to his bride wi hat in hand,
   |     And haild her courteouslie:
   |   'Sit down by me, my bonny Bondwell,
   |     What makes this courtesie?'

   |   51
   |   'An asking, asking, fair lady,
   |     An asking ye'll grant me;'
   |   'Ask on, ask on, my bonny Bondwell,
   |     What may your askings be?'

   |   52
   |   'Five hundred pounds to you I'll gie,
   |     Of gowd an white monie,
   |   If ye'll wed John, my ain cousin;
   |     He looks as fair as me.'

   |   53
   |   'Keep well your monie, Bondwell,' she said,
   |     'Nae monie I ask o thee;
   |   Your cousin John was my first love,
   |     My husband now he's be.'

   |   54
   |   Bondwell was married at morning ear,
   |     John in the afternoon;
   |   Dame Essels is lady ower a' the bowers

        #a.# Falkirk, printed by T. Johnston, 1815. #b.# Stirling,
        M. Randall.

   |   1
   |   In London was Young Bichen born,
   |     He longd strange lands to see;
   |   He set his foot on good ship-board,
   |     And he sailed over the sea.

   |   2
   |   He had not been in a foreign land
   |     A day but only three,
   |   Till he was taken by a savage Moor,
   |     And they used him most cruelly.

   |   3
   |   In every shoulder they put a pin,
   |     To every pin they put a tree;
   |   They made him draw the plow and cart,
   |     Like horse and oxen in his country.

   |   4
   |   He had not servd the savage Moor
   |     A week, nay scarcely but only three,
   |   Till he has casten him in prison strong,
   |     Till he with hunger was like to die.

   |   5
   |   It fell out once upon a day
   |     That Young Bichen he made his moan,
   |   As he lay bound in irons strong,
   |     In a dark and deep dungeon.

   |   6
   |   'An I were again in fair England,
   |     As many merry day I have been,
   |   Then I would curb my roving youth
   |     No more to see a strange land.

   |   7
   |   'O an I were free again now,
   |     And my feet well set on the sea,
   |   I would live in peace in my own country,
   |     And a foreign land I no more would see.'

   |   8
   |   The savage Moor had but one daughter,
   |     I wot her name was Susan Py;
   |   She heard Young Bichen make his moan,
   |     At the prison-door as she past by.

   |   9
   |   'O have ye any lands,' she said,
   |     'Or have you any money free,
   |   Or have you any revenues,
   |     To maintain a lady like me?'

   |   10
   |   'O I have land in fair England,
   |     And I have estates two or three,
   |   And likewise I have revenues,
   |     To maintain a lady like thee.'

   |   11
   |   'O will you promise, Young Bichen,' she says,
   |     'And keep your vow faithful to me,
   |   That at the end of seven years
   |     In fair England you'll marry me?

   |   12
   |   'I'll steal the keys from my father dear,
   |     Tho he keeps them most secretly;
   |   I'll risk my life for to save thine,
   |     And set thee safe upon the sea.'

   |   13
   |   She's stolen the keys from her father,
   |     From under the bed where they lay;
   |   She opened the prison strong
   |     And set Young Bichen at liberty.

   |   14
   |   She's gone to her father's coffer,
   |     Where the gold was red and fair to see;
   |   She filled his pockets with good red gold,
   |     And she set him far upon the sea.

   |   15
   |   'O mind you well, Young Bichen,' she says,
   |     'The vows and oaths you made to me;
   |   When you are come to your native land,
   |     O then remember Susan Py!'

   |   16
   |   But when her father he came home
   |     He missd the keys there where they lay;
   |   He went into the prison strong,
   |     But he saw Young Bichen was away.

   |   17
   |   'Go bring your daughter, madam,' he says,
   |     'And bring her here unto me;
   |   Altho I have no more but her,
   |     Tomorrow I'll gar hang her high.'

   |   18
   |   The lady calld on the maiden fair
   |     To come to her most speedily;
   |   'Go up the country, my child,' she says,
   |     'Stay with my brother two years or three.

   |   19
   |   'I have a brother, he lives in the isles,
   |     He will keep thee most courteously
   |   And stay with him, my child,' she says,
   |     'Till thy father's wrath be turnd from thee.'

   |   20
   |   Now will we leave young Susan Py
   |     A while in her own country,
   |   And will return to Young Bichen,
   |     Who is safe arrived in fair England.

   |   21
   |   He had not been in fair England
   |     Above years scarcely three,
   |   Till he has courted another maid,
   |     And so forgot his Susan Py.

   |   22
   |   The youth being young and in his prime,
   |     Of Susan Py thought not upon,
   |   But his love was laid on another maid,
   |     And the marriage-day it did draw on.

   |   23
   |   But eer the seven years were run,
   |     Susan Py she thought full long;
   |   She set her foot on good ship-board,
   |     And she has saild for fair England.

   |   24
   |   On every finger she put a ring,
   |     On her mid-finger she put three;
   |   She filld her pockets with good red gold,
   |     And she has sailed oer the sea.

   |   25
   |   She had not been in fair England
   |     A day, a day, but only three,
   |   Till she heard Young Bichen was a bridegroom,
   |     And the morrow to be the wedding-day.

   |   26
   |   'Since it is so,' said young Susan,
   |     'That he has provd so false to me,
   |   I'll hie me to Young Bichen's gates,
   |     And see if he minds Susan Py.'

   |   27
   |   She has gone up thro London town,
   |     Where many a lady she there did spy;
   |   There was not a lady in all London
   |     Young Susan that could outvie.

   |   28
   |   She has calld upon a waiting-man,
   |     A waiting-man who stood near by:
   |   'Convey me to Young Bichen's gates,
   |     And well rewarded shals thou be.'

   |   29
   |   When she came to Young Bichen's gate
   |     She chapped loudly at the pin,
   |   Till down there came the proud porter;
   |     'Who's there,' he says, 'that would be in?'

   |   30
   |   'Open the gates, porter,' she says,
   |     'Open them to a lady gay,
   |   And tell your master, porter,' she says,
   |     'To speak a word or two with me.'

   |   31
   |   The porter he has opend the gates;
   |     His eyes were dazzled to see
   |   A lady dressd in gold and jewels;
   |     No page nor waiting-man had she.

   |   32
   |   'O pardon me, madam,' he cried,
   |     'This day it is his wedding-day;
   |   He's up the stairs with his lovely bride,
   |     And a sight of him you cannot see.'

   |   33
   |   She put her hand in her pocket,
   |     And therefrom took out guineas three,
   |   And gave to him, saying, Please, kind sir,
   |     Bring down your master straight to me.

   |   34
   |   The porter up again has gone,
   |     And he fell low down on his knee,
   |   Saying, Master, you will please come down
   |     To a lady who wants you to see.

   |   35
   |   A lady gay stands at your gates,
   |     The like of her I neer did see;
   |   She has more gold above her eye
   |     Nor would buy a baron's land to me.

   |   36
   |   Out then spake the bride's mother,
   |     I'm sure an angry woman was she:
   |   'You're impudent and insolent,
   |     For ye might excepted the bride and me.'

   |   37
   |   'Ye lie, ye lie, ye proud woman,
   |     I'm sure sae loud as I hear you lie;
   |   She has more gold on her body
   |     Than would buy the lands, the bride, and thee!'

   |   38
   |   'Go down, go down, porter,' he says,
   |     'And tell the lady gay from me
   |   That I'm up-stairs wi my lovely bride,
   |     And a sight of her I cannot see.'

   |   39
   |   The porter he goes down again,
   |     The lady waited patiently:
   |   'My master's with his lovely bride,
   |     And he'll not win down my dame to see.'

   |   40
   |   From off her finger she's taen a ring;
   |     'Give that your master,' she says, 'from me,
   |   And tell him now, young man,' she says,
   |     'To send down a cup of wine to me.'

   |   41
   |   'Here's a ring for you, master,' he says,
   |     'On her mid-finger she has three,
   |   And you are desird, my lord,' he says,
   |     'To send down a cup of wine with me.'

   |   42
   |   He hit the table with his foot,
   |     He kepd it with his right knee:
   |   'I'll wed my life and all my land
   |     That is Susan Py, come o'er the sea!'

   |   43
   |   He has gone unto the stair-head,
   |     A step he took but barely three;
   |   He opend the gates most speedily,
   |     And Susan Py he there could see.

   |   44
   |   'Is this the way, Young Bichen,' she says,
   |     'Is this the way you've guided me?
   |   I relieved you from prison strong,
   |     And ill have you rewarded me.

   |   45
   |   'O mind ye, Young Bichen,' she says,
   |     'The vows and oaths that ye made to me,
   |   When ye lay bound in prison strong,
   |     In a deep dungeon of misery?'

   |   46
   |   He took her by the milk-white hand,
   |     And led her into the palace fine;
   |   There was not a lady in all the palace
   |     But Susan Py did all outshine.

   |   47
   |   The day concluded with joy and mirth,
   |     On every side there might you see;
   |   There was great joy in all England
   |     For the wedding-day of Susan Py.

        _6^{4-6} was introduced, with other metrical passages,
        into a long tale of '~Young Beichan and Susy Pye~,' which
        Motherwell had heard related, and of which he gives a
        specimen at p. xv. of his Introduction_: "Well, ye must
        know that in the Moor's castle there was a massymore,
        which is a dark dungeon for keeping prisoners. It was
        twenty feet below the ground, and into this hole they
        closed poor Beichan. There he stood, night and day, up to
        his waist in puddle water; but night or day it was all one
        to him, for no ae styme of light ever got in. So he lay
        there a lang and weary while, and thinking on his heavy
        weird, he made a murnfu sang to pass the time, and this
        was the sang that he made, and grat when he sang it, for
        he never thought of ever escaping from the massymore, or
        of seeing his ain country again:

          'My hounds they all run masterless,
            My hawks they flee from tree to tree;
          My youngest brother will heir my lands,
            And fair England again I'll never see.

          'Oh were I free as I hae been,
            And my ship swimming once more on sea,
          I'd turn my face to fair England,
            And sail no more to a strange countrie.'

        "Now the cruel Moor had a beautiful daughter, called Susy
        Pye, who was accustomed to take a walk every morning in
        her garden, and as she was walking ae day she heard the
        sough o Beichan's sang, coming as it were from below the

[403] Mr Macmath has ascertained that Mrs Brown was born in 1747. She
learned most of her ballads before she was twelve years old, or before
1759. 1783, or a little earlier, is the date when these copies were
taken down from her singing or recitation.

[404] The Borderer's Table Book, VII, 21. Dixon says, a little before,
that the Stirling broadside of 'Lord Bateman' varies but slightly from
the English printed by Hoggett, Durham, and Pitts, Catnach, and others,
London. This is not true of the Stirling broadside of 'Young Bichen:'
see #N b#. I did not notice, until too late, that I had not furnished
myself with the broadside 'Lord Bateman,' and have been obliged to turn
back the Cruikshank copy into ordinary orthography.

[405] We have this repetition in two other ballads of the Skene MSS
besides #D#; see p. 316 of this volume, sts 1-9; also in 'The Lord of
Learne,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, I, 192 f, vv 269-304.

[406] "An old woman who died in Errol, Carse of Gowrie, about twenty
years ago, aged nearly ninety years, was wont invariably to sing this
ballad: 'Young Lundie was in Brechin born.' Lundie is an estate now
belonging to the Earl of Camperdoun, north from Dundee." A. Laing, note
to #G#. That is to say, the old woman's world was Forfarshire.

Mr Logan had heard in Scotland a version in which the hero was called
Lord Bangol: A Pedlar's Pack, p. 15.

[407] Cf. 'The Fair Flower of Northumberland,' #B# 2, #E# 2, pp 115 f.

[408] She does not get away without exciting the solicitude or wrath of
her father, #F#, #M#, #J#, #N#, and in the first two has to use
artifice.

[409] A point borrowed, it well may be, from 'Hind Horn,' #E# 5 f, #A#
10.

[410] So Torello's wife upsets the table, in Boccaccio's story: see p.
198. One of her Slavic kinswomen jumps over four tables and lights on a
fifth.

[411] In #C# 34, #M# 49, she is recognized by one of the hounds which
she had given him. So Bos, seigneur de B['e]nac, who breaks a ring with his
wife, goes to the East, and is prisoner among the Saracens seven years,
on coming back is recognized only by his greyhound: Magasin Pittoresque,
VI, 56 b. It is scarcely necessary to scent the Odyssey here.

[412] Ridiculously changed in #J# 6, #K# 6, #L# 20, to a coach _and_
three, reminding us of that master-stroke in Thackeray's ballad of
'Little Billee,' "a captain of a seventy-three." 'Little Billee,' by the
way, is really like an old ballad, fallen on evil days and evil tongues;
whereas the serious imitations of traditional ballads are not the least
like, and yet, in their way, are often not less ludicrous.

[413] In #M#, to make everything pleasant, Bondwell offers the bride
five hundred pounds to marry his cousin John. She says, Keep your money;
John was my first love. So Bondwell is married at early morn, and John
in the afternoon.

[414] Harleian MS. 2277, from which the life of Beket, in long couplets,
was printed by Mr W. H. Black for the Percy Society, in 1845. The story
of Gilbert Beket is contained in the first 150 vv. The style of this
composition entirely resembles that of Robert of Gloucester, and
portions of the life of Beket are identical with the Chronicle; whence
Mr Black plausibly argues that both are by the same hand. The account of
Beket's parentage is interpolated into Edward Grim's Life, in Cotton MS.
Vitellius, C, XII, from which it is printed by Robertson, Materials for
the History of Thomas Becket, II, 453 ff. It is found in Bromton's
Chronicle, Twysden, Scriptores X, columns 1052-55, and in the First
Quadrilogus, Paris, 1495, from which it is reprinted by Migne,
Patrologi[ae] Cursus Completus, CXC, cols 346 ff. The tale has been
accepted by many writers who would have been better historians for a
little reading of romances. Angustin Thierry sees in Thomas Beket a
Saxon contending in high place, for the interests and with the natural
hatred of his race, against Norman Henry, just as he finds in the yeoman
Robin Hood a leader of Saxon serfs engaged in irregular war with Norman
Richard. But both of St Thomas's parents were Norman; the father of
Rouen, the mother of Caen. The legend was introduced by Lawrence Wade,
following John of Exeter, into a metrical life of Beket of about the
year 1500: see the poem in Englische Studien, III, 417, edited by
Horstmann.

[415] Richard, the proud porter of the ballads, is perhaps most like
himself in #M# 32 ff.

[416] Neither her old name nor her Christian name is told us in this
legend. Gilbert Beket's wife was Matilda, according to most authorities,
but Ro[:e]sa according to one: see Robertson, as above, IV, 81; Migne, cols
278 f. Fox has made Ro[:e]sa into Rose, Acts and Monuments, I, 267, ed.
1641.

Gilbert and Rose (but Ro[:e]sa is not Rose) recall to Hippeau, Vie de St
Thomas par Garnier de Pont Sainte Maxence, p. xxiii, Elie de Saint Gille
and Rosamonde, whose adventures have thus much resemblance with those of
Beket and of Bekie. Elie de Saint Gille, after performing astounding
feats of valor in fight with a horde of Saracens who have made a descent
on Brittany, is carried off to their land. The amiral Macabr['e] requires
Elie to adore Mahomet; Elie refuses in the most insolent terms, and is
condemned to the gallows. He effects his escape, and finds himself
before Macabr['e]'s castle. Here, in another fight, he is desperately
wounded, but is restored by the skill of Rosamonde, the amiral's
daughter, who is Christian at heart, and loves the Frank. To save her
from being forced to marry the king of Bagdad, Elie fights as her
champion. In the end she is baptized, as a preparation for her union
with Elie, but he, having been present at the ceremony, is adjudged by
the archbishop to be gossip to her, and Elie and Rosamonde are otherwise
disposed of. So the French romance, but in the Norse, which, as K[:o]lbing
maintains, is likely to preserve the original story here, there is no
such splitting of cumin, and hero and heroine are united.

[417] There is one in the Gesta Romanorum, cap. 5, [:O]sterley, p. 278, of
about the same age as the Beket legend. It is not particularly
important. A young man is captured by a pirate, and his father will not
send his ransom. The pirate's daughter often visits the captive, who
appeals to her to exert herself for his liberation. She promises to
effect his freedom if he will marry her. This he agrees to. She releases
him from his chains without her father's knowledge, and flies with him
to his native land.

[418] Nor Guarinos in the Spanish ballad, Duran, No 402, I, 265; Wolf
and Hofmann, Primavera, II, 321. Guarinos is very cruelly treated, but
it is his horse, not he, that has to draw carts. For the Sire de Cr['e]qui
see also Dinaux, Trouv[e']res, III, 161 ff (K[:o]hler).

[419] And in 'Der Herr von Falkenstein,' a variety of the story, Meier,

same hardship in Sch[:o]ppner, Sagenbuch, III, 127, No 1076. For other
cases of the wonderful deliverance of captive knights, not previously
mentioned by me, see Hocker, in Wolf's Zeitschrift f[:u]r deutsche

[420] A meisterlied of Alexander von Metz, of the second half of the
fifteenth century, K[:o]rner, Historische Volkslieder, p. 49; the ballad
'Der Graf von Rom,' or 'Der Graf im Pfluge,' Uhland, p. 784, No 299,
printed as early as 1493; De Historie van Florentina, Huysvrouwe van
Alexander van Mets, 1621, van den Bergh, De nederlandsche Volksromans,

[421] [/O]ster-kongens rige, [/O]sterige, [/O]sterland, Austrr['i]ki,
understood by Grundtvig as Gar[dh]ar['i]ki, the Scandinavian-Russian
kingdom of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Austrr['i]ki is used
vaguely, but especially of the east of Europe, Russia, Austria,
sometimes including Turkey (Vigfusson).

[422] In Swedish #K#, as she pushes off from land, she exclaims:

    And she's tuen God her pilot to be.

Scotland, 1870, p. 99; 'Mesterm[/o],' Asbj[/o]rnsen og Moe, No 46;

Second Series, p. 377; the Grimms, Nos 56, 113, 186, 193; Pentamerone,

Highland Tales, I, 25, No 2, and K[:o]hler's notes in Orient u.
Occident, II, 103-114, etc., etc.

[424] This passage leads the editors of Primavera to remark, II, 52,
that 'El Conde Sol' shows distinct traits of 'Le Chat Bott['e].' Similar
questions are asked in English #G#, the other Spanish versions, and the
Italian, and in nearly all the Greek ballads referred to on pp 199, 200;
always under the same circumstances, and to bring about the discovery
which gives the turn to the story. The questions in 'Le Chat Bott['e]' are
introduced for an entirely different purpose, and cannot rationally
suggest a borrowing on either side. The hasty note would certainly have
been erased by the very distinguished editors upon a moment's
consideration.

[425] Puymaigre finds also some resemblance in his 'Petite Rosalie,' I,
74: see his note.

Mr George Lyman Kittredge has called my attention to Apollonius of
Tyana's encounter with an _empusa_ between the Caucasus and the
Indus. Knowing what the spectre was, Apollonius began to revile it,
and told his attendants to do the same, for that was the resource,
in such cases, against an attack. The empusa went off with a shriek.
Philostratus's Life of Apollonius, II, 4. Mr Kittredge referred me
later to what is said by Col. Yule (who also cites Philostratus), Marco
Polo, I, 183, that the wise, according to Mas'udi, revile gh['u]ls,
and the gh['u]ls vanish. Mr Kittredge also cites Luther's experience:
how, when he could not be rid of the Devil by the use of holy writ
and serious words, "so h[:a]tte er ihn oft mit spitzigen Worten und
l[:a]cherlichen Possen vertrieben; ... quia est superbus spiritus, et
non potest ferre contemptum sui." Tischreden, in Auswahl, Berlin, 1877,

#P.# 22 b. #D.# Add: #d.# 'The historical ballad of May Culzean,' an
undated stall-copy.

26 b. Another Dutch version (Frisian), spirited, but with gaps, is given
by Dykstra and van der Meulen, In Doaze fol alde Snypsnaren, Frjentsjer,
1882, p. 118, 'Jan Alberts,' 66 vv. (K[:o]hler.)

#D.# Jan Alberts sings a song, and those that hear it know it not. It is
heard by a king's daughter, who asks her mother's leave to go out for a
walk, and is told that it is all one where she goes or stays, if she
keeps her honor. Her father says the same, when she applies for his
leave. She goes to her bedroom and dresses herself finely, dons a gold
crown, puts her head out of the window, and cries, Now am I Jan Alberts'
bride. Jan Alberts takes her on his horse; they ride fast and long, with
nothing to eat or drink for three days. She then asks Jan why he gives
her nothing, and he answers that he shall ride to the high tree where
hang fourteen fair maids. Arrived there, he gives her the choice of
tree, sword, or water. She chooses the sword, bids him spare his coat,
for a pure maid's blood goes far, and before his coat is half off his
head lies behind him. The head cries, Behind the bush is a pot of
grease; smear my neck with it. She will not smear from a murderer's pot,
nor blow in a murderer's horn. She mounts his horse, and rides far and
long. Jan Alberts' mother comes to meet her, and asks after him. She
says he is not far off, and is sporting with fourteen maids. Had you
told me this before, I would have laid you in the water, says the
mother. The maid rides on till she comes to her father's gate. Then she
cries to her father to open, for his youngest daughter is without. The
father not bestirring himself, she swims the moat, and, the door not
being open, goes through the glass. The next day she dries her clothes.

30 a, 37 a. There is a Low German version of the first class, #A-F#, in
Spee, Volksth[:u]mliches vom Niederrhein, K[:o]ln, 1875, Zweites Heft,
p. 3, 'Sch[:o]ndili,' 50 vv. (K[:o]hler.)

#AA.# Sch[:o]ndili's parents died when she was a child. Sch[:o]n-Albert,
knowing this, rides to her. She attires herself in silk, with a gold
crown on her hair, and he swings her on to his horse. They ride three
days and nights, with nothing to eat or drink. She asks whether it is
not meal-time; he replies that they are coming to a linden, where they
will eat and drink. Seven women are hanging on the tree. He gives her
the wale of tree, river, and sword. She chooses the sword; would be
loath to spot his coat; whips off his head before the coat is half off.
The head says there is a pipe in the saddle; she thinks no good can come
of playing a murderer's pipe. She meets first the father, then the
mother; they think that must be Sch[:o]n-Albert's horse. That may be, she
says; I have not seen him since yesterday. She sets the pipe to her
mouth, when she reaches her father's gate, and the murderers come like
hares on the wind.

not for gold and not for goods, but because she is to die that day.
Heinrich draws his sword, runs her through, and rides home. He is asked
why his sword is red, and says he has killed two doves. They say the
dove must be Anna.

#A b.# Ligar (afterwards Jasia, Golo) bids Kasia take all she has. She
has already done this, and is ready to range the world with him.
Suddenly she asks, after they have been some time on their way, What is
that yonder so green? Jasia replies, Our house, to which we are going.
They go on further, and Kasia again inquires abruptly, What is that
yonder so white? "That is my eight wives, and you shall be the ninth:
you are to die, and will be the tenth." "Where is the gold, the maidens'
gold?" "In the linden, Kasia, in the linden; plenty of it." "Let me not
die so wretchedly; let me draw your sword for once." She drew the sword,
and with one stroke Jasia's head was off.

39 b. To the Polish versions are further to be added: #NN#, Piosnki
wie['s]niacze znad Dzwiny, p. 41, No 51; #OO#, Roger, p. 78, No 138;
#PP#, Roger, p. 69, No 125; #QQ#, ib., p. 79, No 140; #RR#, p. 81, No
142; #SS#, p. 79, No 139. The last three are imperfect, and #QQ#, #RR#,
have a beginning which belongs elsewhere. Jasia suggests to Kasia to get
the key of the new room from her mother by pretending headache, and bids
her take gold enough, #NN#, #OO#. They go off while her mother thinks
that Kasia is sleeping, #NN#, #OO#, #QQ#. They come to a wood, #NN#,
#PP# (which is corrupt here), #SS#; first or last, to a deep stream,
#NN#, #OO#, #QQ#, #SS#; it is red sea in #RR#, as in #J#. Jasia bids
Kasia return to her mother, #NN# (twice), #RR#; bids her take off her
rich clothes, #OO#, to which she answers that she has not come here for
that. John throws her into the water, #NN#, #OO#, #QQ#, #SS#, from a
bridge in the second and third. Her apron catches on a stake or post;
she begs John for help, and gets for answer, "I did not throw you in to
help you: you may go to the bottom," #OO#. She swims to a stake, to
which she clings, and John hews her in three, #QQ#. Fishermen draw out
the body, and carry it to the church, #NN#, #OO#. She apostrophizes her
hair in #QQ#, #SS#, as in #G#, #I#, #J#, and in the same absurd terms in
#QQ# as in #J#. John is pursued and cut to pieces in #OO#, _also_ broken
on the wheel. #PP# closely resembles German ballads of the third class.
Katie shouts three times: at her first cry the grass curls up; at the
second the river overflows; the third wakes her mother, who rouses her
sons, saying, Katie is calling in the wood. They find John with a bloody
sword; he says he has killed a dove. They answer, No dove, but our
sister, and maltreat him till he tells what he has done with his victim:
"I have hidden her under the yew-bush; now put me on the wheel."

39 b, line 13 of the middle paragraph. Read Piosnki for Piesni, and omit
the quotation marks in this and the line before.

40 b, line 2 (the girl's adding her hair to lengthen the cord). In the
tale of the Sea-horse, Schiefner, Awarische Texte, Memoirs of the St
Petersburg Academy, vol. XIX, No 6, p. 11 f, a sixty-ell rope being
required to rescue a prince from a well into which he had been thrown,
and no rope forthcoming, the daughter of a sea-king makes a rope of
the required length with her hair, and with this the prince is drawn
out. Dr Reinhold K[:o]hler, who pointed out this incident to me, refers
in his notes to the texts, at p. vii f, to the song of S[:u]d[:a]i
M[:a]rg[:a]n, Radloff, II, 627-31, where S[:u]d[:a]i M[:a]rg[:a]n's
wife, having to rescue her husband from a pit, tries first his horse's
tail, and finds it too short, then her hair, which proves also a little
short. A maid is then found whose hair is a hundred fathoms long, and
her hair being tied on to the horse's tail, and horse, wife, and maid
pulling together, the hero is drawn out. For climbing up by a maid's
hair, see, further, K[:o]hler's note to Gonzenbach, No 53, II, 236.

40 b, line 7. A message is sent to a father by a daughter in the same
way, in Chodzko, Les Chants historiques de l'Ukraine, p. 75; cf. p. 92,
of the same. Tristram sends messages to Isonde by linden shavings
inscribed with runes: Sir Tristrem, ed. K[:o]lbing, p. 56, st. 187;
Tristrams Saga, cap. 54, p. 68, ed. K[:o]lbing; Gottfried von Strassburg,
vv 14427-441.

40 b, line 36. For #G#, #I#, read #G#, #J#.

40, note [61]. In a Ruthenian ballad a girl who runs away from her
mother with a lover tells her brothers, who have come in search of her,
I did not leave home to go back again with you: Golovatsky, Part I, p.
77, No 32; Part III, I, p. 17, No 4, p. 18, No 5. So, "I have not
poisoned you to help you," Part I, p. 206, No 32, p. 207, No 33.

41 a, second paragraph. Golovatsky, at I, 116, No 29, has a ballad,
found elsewhere without the feature here to be noticed, in which a
Cossack, who is watering his horse while a maid is drawing water,
describes his home as a Wonderland, like John in Polish #Q#. "Come to
the Ukraine with the Cossacks," he says. "Our land is not like this:
with us the mountains are golden, the water is mead, the grass is silk;
with us the willows bear pears and the girls go in gold." She yields;
they go over one mountain and another, and when they have crossed the
third the Cossack lets his horse graze. The maid falls to weeping, and
asks the Cossack, Where are your golden mountains, where the water that
is mead, the grass that is silk? He answers, No girl of sense and reason
engages herself to a young Cossack. So in Zegota Pauli, P. l. ruskiego,
p. 29, No 26==Golovatsky, I, 117, No 30, where the maid rejoins to the
glowing description, I have ranged the world: golden mountains I never
saw; everywhere mountains are of stone, and everywhere rivers are of
water; very like the girl in Grundtvig, 82 #B#, st. 7; 183 #A# 6, #E# 5,
6.

41 b, last paragraph. Several Bohemian versions are to be added to
the single example cited from Waldau's B[:o]hmische Granaten. This
version, which is presumed to have been taken down by Waldau himself,
may be distinguished as #A#. #B#, Su[vs]il, Moravsk['e] N['a]rodn['i]
P['i]sn[ve], No 189, p. 191, 'Vrah,' 'The Murderer,' is very like
#A#. #C#, Su[vs]il, p. 193. #D#, Erben, Proston['a]rodni [vc]esk['e]
P['i]sn[ve] a [vR]['i]kadla, p. 480, No 16, 'Zabit['e] d[ve]v[vc]e,'
'The Murdered Maid.' #E#, p. 479, No 15, 'Zabit['a] sestra,' 'The
Murdered Sister.' #B# has a double set of names, beginning with Black
George,--not the Servian, but "king of Hungary,"--and ending with
Indriasch. The maid is once called Annie, otherwise Katie. At her first
call the grass becomes green; at the second the mountain bows; the
third the mother hears. #C# has marvels of its own. Anna entreats John
to allow her to call to her mother. "Call, call," he says, "you will
not reach her with your call; in this dark wood, even the birds will
not hear you." At her first call a pine-tree in the forest breaks; at
the second the river overflows; at the third her mother rises from the
grave. She calls to her sons to go to Anna's rescue, and _they_ rise
from their graves. The miscreant John confesses that he has buried
their sister in the wood. They strike off his head, and put a bat on
the head, with an inscription in gold letters, to inform people what
his offence has been. There is a gap after the seventh stanza of #D#,
which leaves the two following stanzas unintelligible by themselves:
8, Choose one of the two, and trust nobody; 9, She made her choice,
and shouted three times towards the mountains. At the first cry the
mountain became green; at the second the mountain bowed backwards;
the third the mother heard. She sent her sons off; they found their
neighbor John, who had cut off their sister's head. The law-abiding,
and therefore modern, young men say that John shall go to prison and
never come out alive. In #E# the man, a young hunter, says, Call _five_
times; not even a wood-bird will hear you. Nothing is said of the first
call; the second is heard by the younger brother, who tells the elder
that their sister must be in trouble. The hunter has a bloody rifle in
his hand: how he is disposed of we are not told. All these ballads but
#C# begin with the maid cutting grass, and all of them have the dove
that is "no dove, but our sister."

Fragments of this ballad are found, #F#, in Su[vs]il, p. 112, No 113,
'Nev[ve]sta ne[vs]t' astnice,' 'The Unhappy Bride;' #G#, p. 171, No 171,
'Zbojce,' 'The Murderer;' and there is a variation from #B# at p. 192,
note 3, which is worth remarking, #H#. #F#, sts 11-14: "Get together
what belongs to you; we will go to a foreign land;" and when they came
to the turf, "Look my head through."[426] Every hair she laid aside she
wet with a tear. And when they came into the dark of the wood he cut her
into nine [three] pieces. #G.# Katie meets John in a meadow; they sit
down on the grass. "Look my head through." She weeps, for she says there
is a black fate impending over her; "a black one for me, a red one for
thee." He gets angry, cuts off her head, and throws her into the river,
for which he is hanged. #H.# He sprang from his horse, robbed the maid,
and laughed. He set her on the grass, and bade her look his head
through. Every hair she examined she dropped a tear for. "Why do you
weep, Katie? Is it for your crants?" "I am _not_ weeping for my crants,
nor am I afraid of your sword. Let me call three times, that my father
and mother may hear." Compare German #H# 10, 11; #Q# 8-10, etc., etc.

42 a. These Ruthenian ballads belong with the other Slavic parallels to
No 4: #A#, Zegota Pauli, P. l. ruskiego, p. 21==Golovatsky, III, I, 149,
No 21; #B#, Golovatsky, III, I, 172, No 46. #A.# A man induces a girl to
go off with him in the night. They wander over one land and another, and
then feel need of rest. Why does your head ache? he asks of her. Are you
homesick? "My head does not ache; I am not homesick." He takes her by
the white sides and throws her into the deep Donau, saying, Swim with
the stream; we shall not live together. She swims over the yellow sand,
crying, Was I not fair, or was it my fate? and he dryly answers, Fair;
it was thy fate. In #B# it is a Jew's daughter that is wiled away. They
go in one wagon; another is laden with boxes [of valuables?] and
pillows, a third with gold pennies. She asks, Where is your house? Over
those hills, he answers. He takes her over a high bridge, and throws her
into the Donau, with, Swim, since you were not acquainted with our way,
our faith!

Magyar ballad, p. 45 f. A handsome wench, who had been lost seven
years, suddenly reappeared at the home of her parents. She said that
she was not at liberty to explain where she had been, but her mother
induced her to reveal this to a stone near the side-door, and taking up
her station behind the door heard all. She had been carried off by a
robber; had lived with him seven years, and borne him seven children.
The robber, who had otherwise treated her well, had refused to let
her visit her home, but finally had granted her this permission upon
her promising to say nothing about him. When the time arrived for her
daughter to go back, the mother gave her a bag of peas, which she
was to drop one by one along the way. She was kindly received, but
presently the robber thought there was something strange in her ways.
He laid his head in her lap, inviting her to perform the service so
common in like cases. While she was doing this, she could not but think
how the robber had loved her and how he was about to be betrayed by
her, and her remorseful tears dropped on his face. "So you have told of
me!" cried the astute robber, springing up. He cut off the children's
heads and strung them on a willow-twig before her eyes, and was now
coming to her, when people arrived, under the mother's conduct, who
put a stop to his further revenge, and took their own. See the note,

thorn interposes and makes the union forever impossible. (The thorn is
_creed_. The young man was a Tatar, and his religion had been an
insuperable obstacle in the eyes of the maid's father.) Baron von

I

        A stall-copy lent me by Mrs Alexander Forbes, Liberton,
        Edinburgh.

    1
    'Rise up, rise up, Lord Douglas,' she said,
      'And draw to your arms so bright;
    Let it never be said a daughter of yours
      Shall go with a lord or a knight.

    2
    'Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,
      And draw to your armour so bright;
    Let it never be said a sister of yours
      Shall go with a lord or a knight.'

    3
    He looked over his left shoulder,
      To see what he could see,
    And there he spy'd her seven brethren bold,
      And her father that lov'd her tenderly.

    4
    'Light down, light down, Lady Margret,' he said,
      'And hold my steed in thy hand,
    That I may go fight with your seven brethren bold,
      And your father who's just at hand.'

    5
    O there she stood, and bitter she stood,
      And never did shed a tear,
    Till once she saw her seven brethren slain,
      And her father she lovd so dear.

    6
    'Hold, hold your hand, William,' she said,
      'For thy strokes are wondrous sore;
    For sweethearts I may get many a one,
      But a father I neer will get more.'

    7
    She took out a handkerchief of holland so fine
      And wip'd her father's bloody wound,
    Which ran more clear than the red wine,
      And forked on the cold ground.

    8
    'O chuse you, chuse you, Margret,' he said,
      'Whether you will go or bide!'
    'I must go with you, Lord William,' she said,
      'Since you've left me no other guide.'

    9
    He lifted her on a milk-white steed,
      And himself on a dapple grey,
    With a blue gilded horn hanging by his side,
      And they slowly both rode away.

    10
    Away they rode, and better they rode,
      Till they came to yonder sand,
    Till once they came to yon river side,
      And there they lighted down.

    11
    They lighted down to take a drink
      Of the spring that ran so clear,
    And there she spy'd his bonny heart's blood,
      A running down the stream.

    12
    'Hold up, hold up, Lord William,' she says,
      'For I fear that you are slain;'
    ''T is nought but the shade of my scarlet clothes,
      That is sparkling down the stream.'

    13
    He lifted her on a milk-white steed,
      And himself on a dapple grey,
    With a blue gilded horn hanging by his side,
      And slowly they rode away.

    14
    Ay they rode, and better they rode,
      Till they came to his mother's bower;
    Till once they came to his mother's bower,
      And down they lighted there.

    15
    'O mother, mother, make my bed,
      And make it saft and fine,
    And lay my lady close at my back,
      That I may sleep most sound.'

    16
    Lord William he died eer middle o the night,
      Lady Margret long before the morrow;
    Lord William he died for pure true love,
      And Lady Margret died for sorrow.

    17
    Lord William was bury'd in Lady Mary's kirk,
      The other in Saint Mary's quire;
    Out of William's grave sprang a red rose,
      And out of Margret's a briar.

    18
    And ay they grew, and ay they threw,
      As they wad fain been near;
    And by this you may ken right well
      They were twa lovers dear.

Moravian, Su[vs]il, 'Ne[vs]t'astna svatba,' 'The Unhappy Wedding,' No
89, c, d, pp 85 f. A bridegroom is bringing home his bride; his sword
slips from the sheath and wounds the bride in the side. He binds up the
wound, and begs her to hold out till she comes to the house. The bride
can eat nothing, and dies in the night. Her mother comes in the morning
with loads of cloth and feathers, is put off when she asks for her
daughter, reproaches the bridegroom for having killed her; he pleads his
innocence.

Servian. Karadshitch, I, 309, No 421, 'Jani and Milenko,' belongs to
this class, though mixed with portions of at least one other ballad
('Earl Brand'). Milenko wooes the fair Jani, and is favored by her
mother and by all her brothers but the youngest. This brother goes
hunting, and bids Jani open to nobody while he is away, but Milenko
carries her off on his horse. As they are riding over a green hill, a
branch of a tree catches in Jani's dress. Milenko attempts to cut the
branch off with his knife, but in so doing wounds Jani in the head. Jani
binds up the wound, and they go on, and presently meet the youngest
brother, who hails Milenko, asks where he got the fair maid, discovers
the maid to be his sister, but bids her Godspeed. On reaching his
mother's house, Milenko asks that a bed may be prepared for Jani, who is
in need of repose. Jani dies in the night, Milenko in the morning. They
are buried in one grave; a rose is planted over her, a grape-vine over
him, and these intertwine, "as it were Jani with Milenko."

143 b, after the first paragraph. A pallikar, who is bringing home his
bride, is detained on the way in consequence of his whole train leaving
him to go after a stag. The young man, who has never seen his bride's
face, reaches over his horse to give her a kiss; his knife disengages
itself and wounds her. She begs him to staunch the blood with his
handkerchief, praying only to live to see her bridegroom's house. This
wish is allowed her; she withdraws the handkerchief from the wound and
expires. Dozon, Chansons p. bulgares, 'Le baiser fatal,' p. 270, No 49.

the son drinks the poison. The son makes his will. To his brother he
leaves four black horses, to his sister four cows and four calves, to
his wife a house. "And to me?" the mother asks. "To you that big stone

153 a. I failed to mention, though I had duly noted them, three versions
of 'L'Avvelenato,' which are cited by Professor D'Ancona in his Poesia
popolare Italiana, pp 106 ff.

#D.# The Canon Lorenzo Panciatichi refers to the ballad in a 'Cicalata
in lode della Padella e della Frittura,' recited at the Crusca,
September 24, 1656, and in such manner as shows that it was well known.
He quotes the first question of the mother, "Dove andast[u'] a cena," etc.
To this the son answered, he says, that he had been poisoned with a
roast eel: and the mother asking what the lady had cooked it in, the
reply was, In the oil pot.

#E.# A version obtained by D'Ancona from the singing of a young fellow
from near Pisa, of which the first four stanzas are given. Some verses
after these are lost, for the testament is said to supervene
immediately.

#F.# A version from Lecco, which has the title, derived from its burden,
'De lu cavalieri e figliu de re,' A. Trifone Nutricati Briganti, Intorno
ai Canti e Racconti popolari del Leccese p. 17. The first four stanzas
are cited, and it appears from these that the prince had cooked the eel
himself, and, appropriately, in a gold pan.

154 a, first paragraph. #F# is given by Meltzl, Acta Comparationis,
1880, columns 143 f, in another dialect.

154 b. #Magyar.# The original of this ballad, 'A meg['e]tett J['a]nos,'
'Poisoned John' (as would appear, in the Szekler idiom), was discovered
by the Unitarian bishop Kriza, of Klausenburg, and was published by him
in J. Arany's 'Koszoru,' in 1864. It is more exactly translated by
Meltzl in the Acta Comparationis Litterarum Universarum, 1880, VII,
columns 30 f, the original immediately preceding. Aigner has omitted the
second stanza, and made the third into two, in his translation. The
Szekler has ten two-line stanzas, with the burden, Ah, my bowels are on
fire! Ah, make ready my bed! In the second stanza John says he has eaten
a four-footed crab; in the sixth he leaves his elder brother his yoke of
oxen; in the seventh he leaves his team of four horses to his younger
brother. Also translated in Ungarische Revue, 1883, p. 139, by G.
Heinrich.

#B#, another Szekler version, taken down by Meltzl from the mouth of a
girl, is in seven two-line stanzas, with the burden, Make my bed, sweet
mother! 'J['a]nos,' Acta, cols 140 f, with a German translation. John has
been at his sister-in-law's, and had a stuffed chicken and a big cake.
At his elder sister's they gave him the back of the axe, bloody stripes.
He bequeaths to his elder sister remorse and sickness; to his
sister-in-law six oxen and his wagon; to his father illness and poverty;
to his mother kindness and beggary.

        my friend Patrick Robertson, Esq., Advocate,[427] who
        heard it sung by an old lady in the North Country; and
        though by no means enthusiastic about popular poetry, it
        struck him so forcibly that he requested her to repeat it
        slowly, so as he might write it down." Stanzas 2-5 "were

192. Dr Davidson informs me that many years ago he heard a version of
'Hind Horn,' in four-line stanzas, in which, as in 'Horn et Rymenhild'
and 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' Horn took part in a joust at the
king's court,

    An young Hind Horn was abune them a'.

He remembers further only these stanzas:

    'O got ye this o the sea sailin,
      Or got ye 't o the lan?
    Or got ye 't o the bloody shores o Spain,
      On a droont man's han?'

      On a droont man's han.'

194. A corrupt fragment of a ballad, 'Der Bettler,' in Schr[:o]er's Ausflug
nach Gottschee, p. 210 f (K[:o]hler), retains features like 'Hind Horn.'
The beggar comes to a wedding, and sits by the stove. The bride kindly
says, Nobody is thinking of the beggar, and hands him a glass of wine.
He says, Thanks, fair bride; thou wast my first wife. Upon this the
_bridegroom_ jumps over the table, crying, Bachelor I came, and bachelor
will go.

The Epirots and Albanians have a custom of betrothing or marrying,
commonly in early youth, and of then parting for a long period. A woman
was lately (1875) buried at Iannina who, as the archbishop boasted in
the funeral discourse, had preserved her fidelity to a husband who had
been separated from her thirty years. This unhappy usage has given rise
to a distinct class of songs. Dozon, Chansons populaires bulgares, p.
294, note.

to have been composed by the painter Heinrich G[:o]tting, Dresden, 1585.

198 a, to first paragraph. For the marvellous transportation in these
stories, see a note by Liebrecht in Jahrb[:u]cher f[:u]r rom. u. eng.
Literatur, III, 147. In the same, IV, 110, Liebrecht refers to the
legend of Hugh of Halton, recounted by Dugdale in his Antiquities of
Warwickshire, II, 646, ed. of 1730, and Monasticon Anglicanum, IV, 90 f,
ed. 1823 (and perhaps in Dugdale's Baronage of England, but I have not
found it there). Hugo is another Gerard: the two half-rings miraculously
unite. (K[:o]hler.) See, also, Landau on Torello, 'Der Wunderritt,' Quellen
des Dekameron 1884, pp 193-218.

198 b, third paragraph. Other versions of 'Le Retour du Mari:' Fleury,
Litt['e]rature Orale de la Basse-Normandie, p. 268; E. Legrand, Romania, X,

A ballad of the nature of 'Le Retour du Mari' is very popular in Poland:
Kolberg, No 22, pp 224 ff, some dozen copies; Wojcicki, I, 287;
Wojcicki, II, 311==Kolberg's #c#; Lipinski, p. 159==Kolberg's i;
Konopka, p. 121, No 20; Koz[/l]owski, No 5, p. 35, p. 36, two copies. In
Moravian, 'Prvn['i] milej[vs]['i],' 'The First Love,' Su[vs]il, No 135, p.
131. The general course of the story is that a young man has to go to
the war the day of his wedding or the day after. He commits his bride to
her mother, saying, Keep her for me seven years; and if I do not then
come back, give her to whom you please. He is gone seven years, and,
returning then, asks for his wife. She has just been given to another.
He asks for a fiddle [pipe], and says he will go to the wedding. They
advise him to stay away, for there will be a disturbance. No, he will
only stand at the door and play. The bride jumps over four tables, and
makes a courtesy to him on a fifth, welcomes him and dismisses the new
bridegroom.

199 a, end of the first paragraph. I forgot to mention the version of
Costantino, agreeing closely with Camarda's, in De Rada, Rapsodie d'un
poema albanese raccolte nelle colonie del Napoletano, pp 61-64.

200. A maid, parting from her lover for three years, divides her ring
with him. He forgets, and prepares to marry another woman. She comes to
the nuptials, and is not known. She throws the half ring into a cup,
drinks, and hands the cup to him. He sees the half ring, and joins it to
his own. This is my wife, he says. She delivered me from death. He
annuls his marriage, and espouses the right woman. Miklosisch, Ueber
die Mundarten der Zigeuner, IV, M[:a]rchen u. Lieder, 15th Tale, pp 52-55,
at the end of a story of the class referred to at p. 401 f. (K[:o]hler.)

A personage appeared at Magdeburg in 1348 in the disguise of a pilgrim,
asked for a cup of wine from the archbishop's table, and, in drinking,
dropped into the cup from his mouth the seal ring of the margrave
Waldemar, supposed to have been long dead, but whom he confessed or
avowed himself to be. Kl[:o]den, Diplomatische Geschichte des f[:u]r falsch
erkl[:a]rten Markgrafen Waldemar, p. 189 f. (K[:o]hler.)

A wife who long pursues her husband, lost to her through spells, drops a
ring into his broth at the feast for his second marriage, is recognized,
and they are happily reunited: The Tale of the Hoodie, Campbell, West
Highland Tales, I, 63-66.

In a pretty Portuguese ballad, which has numerous parallels in other
languages, a long-absent husband, after tormenting his wife by telling
her that she is a widow, legitimates himself by saying, Where is your
half of the ring which we parted? Here is mine: 'Bella Infanta,'
Almeida-Garrett, II, 11, 14, Braga, Cantos p. do Archipelago A[c,]oriano,
p. 300; 'Dona Infanta,' 'Dona Catherina,' Braga, Romanceiro Geral, pp 3
f, 7.

The cases in which a simple ring is the means of recognition or
confirmation need, of course, not be multiplied.

226 a. #C.# Cunningham, as Mr Macmath has reminded me, has made this
stanza a part of another ballad, in Cromek's Remains, p. 223.

231. #Catalan.# The Romancerillo Catalan, in the new edition, p. 10, No
12, 'Magdalena,' gives another version, with the variations of eight
more copies, that of the Observaciones being now #C#.

232. Add: #Italian.# Ive, Canti popolari istriani, p. 366, No 14, 'S.
Maria Maddalena.' Mary's father, dying, left her a castle of gold and
silver, from which one day she saw Jesus pass. She wept a fountain of
tears to wash his feet, and dried his feet with her tresses. Then she
asked for a penance. She wished to go into a cave without door or
windows, sleep on the bare ground, eat raw herbs, and drink a _little_
salt water; and this she did. In 'La Maddalena,' Guerrini, Alcuni C. p.
romagnoli, p. 7, there is no penance.


22. St Stephen and Herod.

P. 236 a. #Spanish.# Mil['a]'s new edition, Romancerillo Catalan, No 31,
'El romero acusado de robo,' pp 36-38, adds six copies, not differing in
anything important. In #C#, the youth, un estudiant, n'era ros com un
fil d'or, blanch com Santa Catarina.

I may note that Thomas Becket stands by his votaries when brought to the
gallows as effectually as St James. See Robertson, Materials, etc., I,
369, 471, 515, 524.

238. Note [195] should have been credited to R. K[:o]hler.

238 b, second paragraph. Professor George Stephens informs me that the
miracle of the cock is depicted, among scenes from the life of Jesus, on
an _antependium_ of an altar, derived from an old church in Slesvig, and
now in the Danish Museum. Behind a large table sits a crowned woman, and
at her left stands a crowned man, who points to a dish from which a cock
has started up, with beak wide open. At the queen's right stands an old
woman, simply clad and leaning on a staff. This picture comes between
the Magi announcing Christ's Birth and the Massacre of the Innocents,
and the crowned figures are judged by Professor Stephens to be Herod and
Herodias. Who the old woman should be it is not easy to say, but there
can be no connection with St James. The work is assigned to the last
part of the fourteenth century.

239. Most of the literature on the topic of the restoration of the
roasted cock to life is collected by Dr R. K[:o]hler and by Ferdinand
Wolf, in Jahrb[:u]cher f[:u]r romanische u. englische Literatur,
III, 58 ff, 67 f. Dr K[:o]hler now adds these notes: The miracle
of St James, in Hermann von Fritslar's Heiligenleben, Pfeiffer's
Deutsche Mystiker des vierzehnten Jahrhunderts, I, 168 f; Hahn, Das
alte Passional (from the Golden Legend), p. 223, v. 47-p. 225, v. 85;

Altbayerischer Sagenschatz, pp 652 ff, 656 f.

239 b. Three stone partridges on a buttress of a church at M[:u]hlhausen
are thus accounted for. In the early days of the Reformation a couple of
orthodox divines, while waiting dinner, were discussing the prospect of
the infection spreading to their good city. One of them, growing warm,
declared that there was as much chance of that as of the three
partridges that were roasting in the kitchen taking flight from the
spit. Immediately there was heard a fluttering and a cooing in the
region of the kitchen, the three birds winged their way from the house,
and, lighting on the buttress of Mary Kirk, were instantly turned to
stone, and there they are. Th[:u]ringen und der Harz, mit ihren
Merkw[:u]rdigkeiten, u. s. w., VI, 20 f. (K[:o]hler.)

240 a. The monk Andrius has the scene between Judas and his mother as in
Cursor Mundi, and attributes to Greek writers the opinion that the
roasted cock was the same that caused Peter's compunction. Mussafia,

"About the year 1850 I was on a visit to the rector of Kilmeen, near
Clonakilty, in the county of Cork. My friend brought me to visit the
ruins of an old castle. Over the open fireplace, in the great hall there
was a stone, about two or three feet square, carved in the rudest
fashion, and evidently representing our Lord's sufferings. There were
the cross, the nails, the hammer, the scourge; but there was one piece
of sculpture which I could not understand. It was a sort of rude
semi-circle, the curve below and the diameter above, and at the junction
a figure intended to represent a bird. My friend asked me what it meant.
I confessed my ignorance. 'That,' said he, 'is the cock. The servants
were boiling him for supper, but when the moment came to convict the
_apostle_ he started up, perched on the side of the pot, and astonished
the assembly by his salutation of the morning.'" Notes and Queries, 5th
series, IX, 412 a. (K[:o]hler.)

A heathen in West Gothland (Vestrogothia) had killed his herdsman,
Torsten, a Christian, and was reproached for it by Torsten's wife.
Pointing to an ox that had been slaughtered, the heathen answered: Tam
Torstenum tuum, quem sanctum et in c[oe]lis vivere existimas, plane ita
vivum credo prout hunc bovem quem in frusta c[ae]dendum conspicis. Mirum
dictu, vix verba finiverat, cum e vestigio bos in pedes se erexit vivus,

Religieuse;' Po['e]sies populaires de la France, III, fol. 289, fol. 297. A
soldier who has been absent some years in the wars returns to find his
mistress in a convent; obtains permission to see her for a last time,
puts a ring on her finger, and then "falls dead." His love insists on
conducting his funeral; the lover returns to life and carries her off.

The same story, perverted to tragedy at the end, in Golovatsky, II, 710,
No 13, a ballad of the Carpathian Russians in Hungary.

250. Dr R. K[:o]hler points out to me a German copy of #A#, #B#, #C#, which
I had overlooked, in Schr[:o]er, Ein Ausflug nach Gottschee, p. 266 ff,
'Hansel june.' The mother builds a mill and a church, and then the young
man feigns death, as before. But a very cheap tragic turn is given to
the conclusion when the young man springs up and kisses his love. She
falls dead with fright, and he declares that since she has died for him
he will die for her. So they are buried severally at one and the other
side of the church, and two lily stocks are planted, which embrace "like
two real married people;" or, a vine grows from one and a flower from
the other.

    Then he has written a broad letter,
      And seald it wi his hand,
    And sent it on to his true love,
      As fast as boy could gang.

      Were making for him a bier;
    One half o it was gude red gowd,
      The other siller clear.

    11
    Three o Willie's eldest sisters
      Were making for him a sark;
    The one half o it was cambric fine,
      The other needle wark.

    12
    Out spake the youngest o his sisters,
      As she stood on the fleer:
    How happy would our brother been,
      If ye'd been sooner here!

    She lifted up the green covering,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
