The New Royal Cook Book


The new Royal Cook Book has been prepared to meet the large and ever
increasing demand for a guide to wholesome and palatable home cooking.
The young housewife will find here complete simple directions for making
delicious cakes and other culinary delights. Experienced cooks and those
more skilled in the art will find here many of their favorite recipes
and in addition helpful suggestions, especially in the matter of saving
eggs and other expensive materials.

=Every recipe has been tested many times and all have been found
excellent.=

Royal Baking Powder is used in all recipes in which a leavening agent is
required, and the biscuits, muffins, griddle cakes, doughnuts, cakes and
pastry prepared by its use are unequalled in texture and healthfulness.
"Royal" imparts a fine appearance, and a particularly good flavor to the
food.

Housekeepers are urged to avoid substitutes for Royal Baking Powder.
Failures in baking often result from the use of sour milk and soda, or
even home made mixtures of cream of tartar and soda, because of
inability to determine the uncertain strength of such materials and
hence the proper proportions to use.

=Avoid all guess work by using "Royal." It is always the same, always
dependable.=

SOME SECRETS OF GOOD COOKING


The addition of one or two teaspoons of Royal Baking Powder to plain
pastry will add wonderfully to its qualities, making it very light and
tender.

_Omelets_ are improved by the addition of a small amount of Royal Baking
Powder.

Royal Baking Powder may be added with great advantage to _bread
pudding_, _poultry dressing_, _stuffed_ or _deviled crabs_ and other
preparations in which broken bread or bread crumbs are used.

_Icings_ and especially Ornamental Icings are improved in texture and
flavor by the addition of about a teaspoon of Royal Baking Powder.

Instead of adding soda to keep color in green vegetables use Royal
Baking Powder.




Royal Baking Powder


For raising or leavening breads, biscuits, rolls, muffins, griddle
cakes, doughnuts, cakes, pastries, puddings and other similar foods.


Absolutely Pure and Wholesome

The principal active ingredient of Royal Baking Powder is Royal Grape
Cream of Tartar, a derivative of rich, ripe grapes. It perfectly aerates
and leavens the batter or dough and makes the food finer in appearance,
more delicious to the taste, and more healthful.

It possesses the greatest practicable leavening strength, never varies
in quality, and will keep fresh and perfect in all climates until used.


The Standard for over 50 Years

For over 50 years Royal Baking Powder has been the standard. Most of the
famous baking recipes in use today were created with it. Most of the
famous cooking schools use it. Housewives all over the world have
followed the lead of the American housewife and insist upon it. "I must
have La Royal," say our Spanish-speaking neighbors in Mexico, Cuba and
South America. "I want Royal Baking Powder and no other," say housewives
in England, Scotland and Ireland.

Only unequalled quality could create such a world-wide demand.


Used in Leading Hotels

Prominent chefs and expert bakers in America, including those of the
famous restaurants in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and other cities,
consider Royal Baking Powder the most reliable, most efficient and the
most dependable leavening agent.

Physicians recommend Royal Baking Powder for its wholesomeness and for
the healthful qualities that it adds to the food.

_For Making the Finest and Most Healthful Food, Royal Baking Powder is
Indispensable._




GENERAL SUGGESTIONS


Where shortening is mentioned in the recipes it is understood that
butter or lard, or an equivalent quantity of butter substitute or
vegetable oil may be used.


MEASUREMENTS

All measurements for all materials called for in the recipes in this
book are level.

The standard measuring cup holds one-half pint and is divided into
fourths and thirds.

To make level measurements fill cup or spoon and scrape off excess with
back of knife.

One-half spoon is measured lengthwise of spoon.

Sift flour before measuring.


BAKING

Regulate the oven carefully before mixing the ingredients. Many a cake
otherwise perfectly prepared is spoiled because the oven is too hot or
not hot enough.

Biscuits and pastry require a hot oven; cakes, a moderate oven.

When a cake is thoroughly baked it shrinks from the sides of the pan. A
light touch with the finger which leaves no mark is another indication
that the cake is baked.

Pastry and Pies


A pinch of salt and a little Royal Baking Powder make pastry light,
flaky and more digestible.

Pastry should rise in baking to double its thickness, and be in light
flaky layers. The novice must learn to handle it lightly and as little
as possible in rolling and turning. It is important to have all
materials and utensils cold.

Pastry is better if allowed to stand in the icebox several hours before
using.

    2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder
    1/2 cup shortening
    cold water

Sift together flour, salt and baking powder; add shortening and rub in
very lightly with tips of fingers. Add cold water very slowly, enough to
hold dough together (do not work or knead dough and handle as little as
possible). Divide in halves; roll out one part thin on floured board,
and use for bottom crust. After pie is filled roll out other part for
top. Cover pie; press edges together; trim off pastry and bake.

lightly with fingers; add water slowly until of right consistency to
roll out. Divide in halves; roll out one half thin; put on in small
pieces half remaining shortening; fold upper and lower edges in to
center; fold sides in to center; fold sides to center again; roll out
thin and put loosely over pie plate, bringing paste well over edge of
plate; trim off edges. Repeat with other half for top crust.

lightly; add just enough water to hold dough together. Roll half out on
floured board, line bottom of pie plate; fill in apples, which have been
washed, pared and cut into thin slices; sprinkle with sugar, and small
pieces of butter; flavor with cinnamon or nutmeg; wet edges of crust
with cold water; roll out remainder of pastry; cover pie, pressing edges

Meats


Roasting

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie into shape if necessary. Put
some pieces of fat in bottom of pan, and season meat with salt and
pepper. Have oven very hot at first and when meat is half done reduce
heat. Baste every 10 to 15 minutes. If there is danger of fat in pan
being scorched add a little boiling water. Roast from 10 to 15 minutes
for each pound of meat, as it is desired rare or well done.


Broiling

The rules for roasting meat apply to broiling, except that instead of
cooking it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, first on one side
and then on the other, over hot coals or directly under a gas flame,
turning every minute until done. Meat an inch and one-half thick will
broil in 8 to 15 minutes. Season after it is cooked.


Pan Broiling or Frying

Put meat to be broiled or fried in very hot frying pan, with very little
or no fat. Turn every few minutes until cooked. Season and serve
immediately. Steaks and chops may be pan-broiled without any fat in the
pan. For thin gravy pour a little boiling water into pan after meat is
taken out.


Boiling and Stewing

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into boiling water and boiled hard
for about 5 minutes; reduce heat and boil gently about 20 minutes for
each pound, salt and spices may be added for seasoning. A little vinegar
put into the water with tough meat makes it tender. The broth of boiled
meat should always be saved for soups, stews or gravies. Salt meats
should be put in cold water, which as soon as it boils should be
replaced by fresh cold water, repeating if necessary until meat has
palatable flavor when done. Salted and smoked meats require about 30
minutes slow boiling, to each pound. Vegetables and herbs may be boiled
with them to flavor. When cooked keep hot until required, if they are to
be served hot; if they are to be served cold, cool in liquor in which
they were boiled. Very salt meats, or those much dried in smoking,
should be soaked over night in cold water.


Pot Roasting

Tough cuts of meat may be first browned in fat, then half covered with
boiling water and cooked slowly either in oven or in iron kettle on top
of stove. This method requires long, slow cooking.

Beverages


How to Make Coffee

The best method of making coffee, as determined by the Better
Coffee-Making Committee of the National Association of Coffee Roasters,
is as follows:

"Fill a kettle with fresh cold water and put it on to boil. Place over
an open china teapot, kept just for coffee, a clean, wet, old linen
napkin, or a new square of unbleached muslin, letting it sag toward the
center. Put into the depression 4 heaping tablespoons (for 4 cups of
coffee) of finely pulverized coffee. This fine pulverization is very
important. Ordinary ground coffee will not do at all, and gives weak
infusions.

"When the water in the kettle is boiling fiercely, pour it through the
coffee slowly until 4 cups have gone through, or a trifle more for 4
cups of coffee.

"Cover and take at once to table.

"Wash the cloth immediately and keep it in a jar of cold water, never
permitting it to get dry, and freshening the water every day. Keeping
the cloth sweet is essential. Every effort should be made to this end.
The least souring ruins the coffee.

"Follow these directions strictly, paying especial attention to having
the coffee very fine, like flour, and the water boiling, and you will
have excellent coffee even though you buy cheap blends."


Boiled Coffee

For 4 cups. Beat half an egg white with 3 tablespoons cold water; add

Fireless Cookery


The Fireless Cooker has become an important factor in the home. The
principle employed is the preservation of heat by the use of
non-conducting materials. The device ordinarily used is a rectangular
box lined on all sides with some substance which will prevent escape of
heat, with spaces or wells for the insertion of stone or metal discs or
radiators and vessels containing food to be cooked.

Among the advantages of this method are: the improvement in flavor by
slower cooking with little opportunity for evaporation; improved
appearance of food that is subject to shrinkage when cooked by ordinary
methods; saving in labor, as the cooking practically takes care of
itself. Dinner may be prepared in the morning, placed in the cooker, and
without further attention be ready to serve at any time after 3 or 4
hours. While the time required for cooking is longer than in the usual
methods, the actual time consumed in preparation of a meal is
considerably reduced.


DIRECTIONS

Prepare food for cooking as usual. Place in special vessel, designed to
fit into wells of Fireless Cooker, and heat on range or over gas flame
until ordinary cooking temperature is reached. Put into cooker with one
or more radiators which have been heated for 10 or 15 minutes over hot
fire. For roasting, radiator should be hot enough to brown a pinch of
flour immediately. Close cover, fasten lightly so that the steam may
escape and allow cooking to proceed for time specified in recipes.

For baking cake, apples, etc., proceed as for roasting. The time
required for baking is slightly longer than that specified for regular
ovens. For cake ordinarily baked in a moderate oven, heat radiators hot
enough to brown a pinch of flour in half a minute.

The Fireless Cooker is especially convenient for the preparation of
cereals, meats, vegetables and other dishes that are ordinarily boiled
or roasted. Remember that foods should be thoroughly heated before
putting into cooker.


Cereals

Prepare cereal for cooking in double boiler as usual. Boil over fire for
5 minutes; place in larger vessel of boiling water in cooker and allow
it to remain 4 or 5 hours or longer. If placed in cooker at night it
should remain warm enough to serve for breakfast.


Steaming

For recipes see "Boston Brown Bread," "Steamed Fig Pudding," "Poor Man's
Pudding," "Christmas Plum Pudding," etc. Prepare and mix ingredients as
directed. Put into greased molds and place in shallow pan of boiling
water over very hot radiator in cooker. Fasten cover tight and cook for
5 to 6 hours.


Soups

Place ingredients in vessel; cover with cold water; bring to boil over
free flame and boil 5 minutes. Fasten cover and transfer to cooker,
using one hot radiator in bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours and season
when ready to serve.

For ingredients and special directions for preparing soups, see "Soups."


Roast Meats

Prepare and season meat in usual way. Place in large dry vessel; put
very hot radiator in bottom of cooker well; place vessel containing
roast on radiator, and place another very hot radiator on top. Close
cooker and fasten. Allow it to remain about one-half hour per pound of
meat.

The roast may be browned in a very hot oven before putting into cooker
or just before serving.


Boiled or Stewed Meats

Prepare meat for cooking as usual, searing in frying pan if desired
brown. Place in large vessel and cover or partly cover with boiling
water, boiling with cover fastened tight for 10 or 15 minutes over free
flame. Transfer to cooker, using one hot radiator underneath. Cook 2 or
3 hours, season and serve.


Vegetables

Prepare vegetables as usual. Place in vessel with small quantity of
boiling water. As there is little evaporation in fireless cookers,
allowance does not have to be made for loss by evaporation. Boil over
free flame for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to cooker, using one radiator
in bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours, remove from cooker, season and
serve.




Invalid Cookery


Always prepare food for the sick in the most careful and attractive
manner. In sickness the senses are unusually acute and far more
susceptible to carelessness and mistakes in the preparation and serving
of food than in health.


Barley Water

    2 tablespoons pearl barley
    2 quarts cold water

Wash barley, soak several hours in cold water and boil gently in same
water for 2 hours; or put into double boiler and cook for 4 hours or
until reduced one-half. Lemon juice and sugar or salt to taste may be
added if desired.


Pineapple Juice

Peel a very ripe pineapple, cut into small pieces and put through fruit
press or potato ricer to extract all juice. Strain and serve with
cracked ice.


Albuminized Orange

    1 egg white
    juice of 1 orange
    sugar

Add orange juice sweetened to taste to egg white and beat well. Chill on
ice and serve cold.


Beef Tea

    1 pound lean beef
    1 cup cold water

Cut beef up into small pieces or put through meat chopper. Put into
fruit jar; add water and allow to stand 15 to 20 minutes to draw out the
juice. Place on trivet or rack in pan of cold water; heat very slowly
for about 2 hours. The water must not boil. Season, strain, cool and
remove fat. Beef tea may be served hot or cold.


Scraped Beef

Scrape meat with sharp knife from lean beef cut from round until nothing
but connective tissue is left. Form into small balls and broil slowly
for about 2 minutes. Season and serve. For sandwiches do not cook but
spread between thin slices of bread and season.


Spanish Cream

    2 cups scalded milk
    4 egg yolks
    1/4 cup sugar
    2 tablespoons granulated gelatine
    1/4 cup cold water
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1 pint cream

Pour scalded milk very slowly over egg yolks and sugar which have been
mixed together. Cook slowly in double boiler until thick and smooth.
Pour over gelatine which has been soaking in 1/4 cup of water. Chill,
add vanilla and beat with egg whip until thick. Add the cream which has
been whipped and chill in molds.

oven about 35 minutes.

In addition to the foregoing, many of the soups, broths, jellies, ices
and plain drop cakes found in the preceding pages are suitable for
invalids and convalescents.




Preserving and Canning

(Material adapted from U. S. Food Administration and N. Y. State
Department of Agriculture.)


General Directions

Test all jars for leakage before using. To do this, fill with water, put
on rubber and cover, seal and invert.

Sterilize all utensils, jars, covers, etc., by covering with cold water,
and boil for 10 minutes. Use only new rubbers and dip in boiling water
just before using.

Use a wide-mouthed funnel when filling jars to avoid loss of material
and keep jar rim clean.

Invert all jars after filling and sealing.

Fruit should be sound, firm and not overripe. All fruit should be
carefully prepared.

Clean fruit, clean hands, clean utensils, and a clean kitchen free from
flies, are essential for safety and success.

Keep products in a cool place. Avoid freezing in winter.


Canning

Canning is the operation of preparing sterilized food so that it will
keep indefinitely.

The custom of canning fruit in syrup is based on the improvement in
flavor and texture which sugar gives to fruit. Sugar is not necessary
for its preservation. Success depends upon thorough sterilization--that
is, killing the organisms which cause food to spoil, and then sealing
carefully to prevent their entrance. Fruit may be canned in water, in
fruit juice and in syrup.


Preserving

The only difference between preserving and canning fruit is that sugar
is always used in preserving, while in canning it is used in smaller
quantity or not at all. In preserving the old rule of equal weights of
sugar and fruit may be followed.


Directions for Canning by Open-Kettle Method

By this method which is generally used, for preserves, jams and
marmalades, food is completely cooked and poured boiling hot into
sterilized jars.

Prepare fruit, which may or may not be peeled, and cut into pieces
depending on the variety. Blanch or scald peaches and similar fruits to
loosen skin and chill by plunging into cold water. Cook slowly in as
little water as possible or in fruit juice or fruit syrup until done.
Fill the sterilized jars, seal and invert.


Directions for Canning by Can-Cooked Method

By this method uncooked or partly cooked food is packed in can or jar,
covered with liquid and both jar and contents sterilized.

Pare fruit if desired or blanch or scald in boiling water a small
quantity of the fruit at a time. (See time table.) Do not blanch
cherries, sour cherries excepted, berries or plums.

Chill outside of the blanched fruit by immersing it for a few minutes in
a vessel of cold water. Remove skin from such fruits as peaches.

Pack firmly in clean, tested jars to within one-half inch of top.

Fill jars to within 1/4 inch of top with boiling water, fruit juice, or
syrup.

Place a new rubber on each jar, adjust cover and partly seal.

Place jars on false bottom of water bath and sterilize for required
time. (See time-table.) If the hot-water bath is used, jars should be
immersed in sufficient boiling water to cover tops to depth of about 1
inch. Do not begin to time the sterilizing until water boils. Keep water
boiling during sterilizing period.

Remove jars from sterilizer. Seal them and invert to cool. Avoid a draft
on jars, but cool as rapidly as possible.

Wash and label jars. Wrap in paper or store in a dark place to prevent
loss of color of red fruit.

Vegetables may also be canned by this method.

Use of Sugar in Canning Fruit

Sugar is used in canning fruit for the purpose of improving flavor and
is not necessary for preservation.

Thin syrup--1 part sugar to 2 parts water for sweet fruits.

Medium Syrup--1 part sugar to 1 part water for berries and medium sweet
fruits.

Thick Syrup--2 parts sugar to 1 part water for sour fruits.

To make syrup add sugar to boiling water. Stir until all sugar is
dissolved, then boil 2 or 3 minutes.


Canned Peaches

Scald sound, firm freestone peaches, a small number at a time, in
boiling water just long enough to loosen skins; dip them quickly into
cold water and slip off skins. Cut peaches in halves, and remove stones.
Have ready a syrup made by boiling sugar and water together until sugar
has dissolved, using 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar to each cup water. Allow about
1 cup syrup for each quart jar of peaches. Put in 1 cracked peach pit
for every quart of syrup.

Can-cooked Method.--Pack peaches in overlapping layers with rounded side
uppermost and blossom end facing glass. Fill each jar with hot syrup and
adjust rubber, cover and upper clamp, thus partly sealing jar. Place
jars on a rack in hot water to cover tops to a depth of 1 inch. Bring
water to boiling point, and boil pint jars 16 minutes, quart jars 20
minutes. Remove jars, seal and invert to cool.

Open-kettle Method.--Cook peaches in syrup until tender; then with
sterilized spoon slip them carefully into sterilized jar; fill jar to
overflowing with syrup. Adjust rubber, cover, seal immediately, and
invert to cool.


Canned Cherries

Wash. Cherries should be pitted before being canned in order to conserve
space. Can sweet cherries as berries. Blanch sour cherries 1/2 minute,
in boiling water. Dip in cold water; drain and pack closely into hot
sterilized jars. Cover with boiling water or boiling medium syrup.
Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in boiling water bath. Remove jars at
once, tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.


Canned Pears

Wash and peel fruit and follow directions for canned peaches.


Canned Berries

Blackberries, blueberries, huckleberries, raspberries, loganberries,
gooseberries and strawberries should be canned as soon as possible after
picking. Hull or stem; place in strainer and wash by lifting up and down
in pan of cold water.

Pack into hot sterilized glass jars, using care not to crush fruit. To
insure a close pack, put a 2 or 3 inch layer of berries on the bottom of
jar and press down gently with spoon. Continue in this manner until jar
is filled. Boiling water or boiling thin or medium syrup should be
poured over the fruit at once. Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in
boiling water. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to test seal and
cool.


Asparagus

Asparagus for canning must be fresh and tender. Select tips of uniform
size and maturity and wash. Cut into lengths according to containers to
be used. Scrape off scales, tough outer skins and hard ends and tie in
bundles large enough for one jar.

Immerse the lower ends in boiling water and leave them immersed for 5
minutes, then the entire stalks, leaving them in 1 to 3 minutes longer.

Cold dip, drain, pack neatly, tips up, in hot sterilized jars. Add salt
and cover with boiling water. Loosely seal, sterilize two hours in
boiling water bath. Remove as soon as time is up. Tighten covers, invert
to test seal and cool.


Beans

Green String Beans and Wax Beans.--The beans should be tender and fresh,
and graded according to size and washed. Leave whole or break in uniform
pieces. Blanch 5 to 10 minutes until the pod will bend without breaking.
Cold dip, drain well and pack into hot jars. Add salt and cover with
boiling water. Loosely seal and sterilize two hours in boiling water.
Remove when time is up, tighten covers, and invert to test seal.


Corn

Make careful selection of tender, juicy sweet corn, at best stage for
table use. Can as soon as possible after gathering. Remove husks and
silk; blanch tender ears 5 minutes, older ears 10 minutes. Cold dip and
cut from cob but not too close. Pack at once into hot sterilized jars.
As corn swells during sterilization, leave space of 1 inch at top. Add
salt and cover with boiling water. Be sure that water penetrates through
corn to the bottom of jar. Loosely seal and sterilize three hours in
boiling water. Remove when time is up, tighten covers, invert to test
seal and cool.


Jams

Jams are usually made with small fruits or with chopped large fruits.
Cook slowly with an equal weight of sugar until thick; put into
sterilized tumblers or jars and seal.


Raspberry Jam

Pick over berries. Mash a few in bottom of preserving kettle; continue
until fruit is used. Heat slowly to boiling point and add equal quantity
of heated sugar. Cook slowly 45 minutes. Put into sterilized jars.

Blackberry, gooseberry or other berry jam may be made in this way.


Plum Conserve

    4 pounds plums
    1 cup seeded raisins
    2 oranges
    sugar
    juice of 1 lemon
    1/2 pound walnuts

Wash plums; remove stones; add raisins and oranges which have been
sliced very fine. Measure and add 3/4 cup sugar to each cup fruit and
juice. Put into kettle, cook slowly about 45 minutes or until thick like
jam, stirring to keep from burning. Add lemon juice and chopped nuts.
Pour into sterilized jars.


Spiced Currants

    3 lbs. white sugar
    5 lbs. ripe currants
    1 tablespoon cinnamon
    1 tablespoon nutmeg
    1 tablespoon cloves

    1/2 pint vinegar

Boil currants one hour, then add sugar, spices and one-half pint
vinegar, boil one-half hour longer. Pour into jars and store.


Jellies

Heat and mash fruit until juice runs readily. If fruit is not entirely
broken up rub through coarse sieve. Pour into sterilized jelly bags of
unbleached muslin or doubled cheesecloth and drain thoroughly but do not
squeeze. Take 7/8 cup sugar for each cup of juice. Boil juice 8 to 20
minutes (berries and currants less than other fruits); add sugar which
has been heated in oven; stir until sugar is dissolved and boil about 5
minutes. Pour into hot sterilized tumblers. Hard fruits like apples and
quinces should be cut up, covered with cold water and cooked until
tender before turning into jelly bags.


Pickles

Pickled Peaches

    2 pounds brown sugar
    2 cups vinegar
    1 ounce stick cinnamon
    1/2 ounce whole cloves

Keep the Home Baking Safeguarded


Housekeepers who have always used Royal Baking Powder with utmost
satisfaction are sometimes misled into experimenting with baking powders
containing questionable ingredients.

No real economy is thus accomplished--in fact, the use of an
unwholesome, undependable baking powder often produces a bitter taste in
the food which makes it unappetizing and sometimes inedible, to say
nothing of the injurious effect produced upon the digestive system.

Royal Baking Powder is most economical. Its well-known dependability
makes baking success simpler and surer, thus preventing loss of eggs,
flour, butter and other ingredients. Only the best materials are used in
its production--pure cream of tartar and tartaric acid, derived from
grapes, bicarbonate of soda and corn starch, all scientifically blended
and perfectly balanced. The best is always the most economical.

=To insure food that is always delicious, wholesome and appetizing,
insist on using Royal Baking Powder which is made from Cream of Tartar,
derived from grapes.=




BAKE IT WITH ROYAL AND BE SURE


has been the motto for fifty years in millions of homes where good food
is recognized as the first essential of good health and where pride is
taken in good baking.

One of the distinctive qualities of food baked with Royal Baking Powder
is _wholesomeness_.

This is health insurance of such vital importance that millions of women
bake at home just to be sure that Royal Baking Powder is used.

_Remember the adage_--

"Bake it with Royal and be sure."

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
