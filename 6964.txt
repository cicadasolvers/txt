CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION TO THE DIVINATION BY TEA-LEAVES


At no time in the history of the world has there been such earnest
searching for light and knowledge in all matters relating to Psychic
Phenomena as in the present day. The desire to investigate some new
disclosure has resulted in yet other discoveries. Such will be handed on
in their various forms to be studied and used by those who seek to
learn.

Few subjects need more patience than those dealing with Psychology. Even
those who put their knowledge to a practical use in such studies as
divination by tea-leaves, must still plod patiently along a path thickly
strewn with new knowledge. The powers of clairvoyance, for instance,
cannot be forced or hurried; such arbitrary laws as time have no meaning
for the subconscious self, therefore the need for hurry does not exist.

I was once told by a very mediumistic woman that she had sat in the same
room at the same time for an hour every day for seven years, because she
"wished to develop Clairvoyance." Here was patience indeed! In some
manifestations of the clairvoyant powers within us, it is spontaneous,
the closing of the eyes to shut out all material surroundings being all
that is necessary to bring a vision of what is happening, or shortly to
happen, possibly hundreds of miles away.

In all dreams the clairvoyant powers are spontaneous; but for the
development of clairvoyance at will, great perseverance is necessary.
Its interests and powers are unlimited, so that it is well worth the
patience and time spent upon it.

In the use of tea-leaves as a means of divination, the more developed
the "clear sight," the more interesting and accurate will be the
interpretation. Practice is most necessary, especially for those who
have less natural clairvoyance than others.

The desire for knowledge on all Psychic matters has led to an increased
demand for various methods of bringing into symbols and pictures that
hidden knowledge of the present and the future. That this knowledge can
be translated to us symbolically is apparent to everyone--who could
doubt it, and still believe in anything at all?

Tea-leaves are habitually used by many people as a means of divination.
To some it is an easier method than the cards, there is less to
memorise, or the crystal.

There is in Paris a famous clairvoyant who always uses tea-leaves as the
medium for her powers of divination. Some are inclined to jeer at the
fortune in the teacup, but if the language of symbolism is rightly
understood, the medium through which it is seen matters little.

Tea-leaves have the advantage of being simple, inexpensive, and within
the reach of everyone. It cannot be claimed that the cult is of the
greatest antiquity; for although it seems to have been used in China
from very early times, tea was not brought into Europe until about the
middle of the sixteenth century. For many years after its introduction
into this country, tea was far too costly to be used except by a
comparatively small proportion of the population. It has, however,
proved its extreme usefulness as a means of divination, as well as its
merits as a beverage, for close upon three centuries.

It is a very favourite method with the Highlanders, where it is
customary for the "guid wife" to read in her cup of tea at breakfast the
events she may look for during the day. Simple though they may probably
be, there are to be seen in the tea-leaves, a letter, a parcel, a
visitor, a wedding, and so on. It is said that no Highland seer would
take money for making prognostications as to the future. This, no doubt,
is one good reason for their powers as clairvoyants.

It is a misfortune that clairvoyance should ever have to come into the
material necessities of money transactions, as it tends to mar the clear
vision.

It is said by some that tea-leaves can foretell the events for
twenty-four hours only. As clairvoyance has no restrictions as to time
or space, I cannot see how it can be thus laid down as a fact that it is
limited to man-made laws of time! Certainly there is much evidence of
the "tea leaves" being capable of foreseeing events of an important
nature at a considerable distance ahead.

One of the most difficult points in interpreting visions of clairvoyance
is the time element; simply because time, as we know it, does not exist.
The intuitive faculty is needed for any accurate definition of time, so
important to us in our present conditions, so absolutely unimportant to
the subconscious self. Let us decide at once, then, that divination by
tea-leaves may, and often does, extend to a further vision than that of
the twenty-four hours. Much depends upon the methods used.

Our individual past, quite apart from the arbitrary laws of heredity,
makes the road of our future. Possibly this may account for the curious
fact that in dreams the setting is often in childhood's surroundings,
while the dream itself is obviously of the present or the future. This
shows how the first beginnings of the event which is to come were
brought about. It is somewhat like unwinding a cotton reel!

There are, no doubt, some who look upon the tea-leaves merely as a form
of amusement, and who entertain their friends in that way. Well, it is a
harmless amusement, and is often useful at a very dull tea party! But
for those who take it seriously, and regard it as one of the many means
of divination, it will be treated with the respect due to such matters.

As in other forms of divination, so with the reading of the tea-cup, a
great deal depends on the seer. Those who are naturally clairvoyant will
read many events and scenes in the cup which would be passed over by
others not so gifted. Even without this "clear sight," however, the
tea-leaves may be read by anyone who has learned the principles and the
symbolic meanings given in this book. With a certain amount of intuition
and imagination, the tea-cups may be most successfully used to reveal
the future.




CHAPTER II

PRACTICE AND METHOD


A wide, shallow cup is the best kind to use for tea-leaf
divination--white if possible. A narrow cup adds to the seer's
difficulties, as the tea-leaves cannot be plainly seen. Small cups, too,
are objectionable for the same reason, and a fluted cup is even worse. A
plain, even surface is required, with no pattern of any kind, as this
has a tendency to confuse the symbols. Indian tea and the cheaper
mixtures, which contain so much dust and twigs are of no use for reading
a fortune, as they cannot form into pictures and symbols that can easily
be distinguished.

Those who desire to have their tea-leaves interpreted should leave about
a teaspoonful of tea at the bottom of the cup. It should then be taken
in the left hand, and turned three times from left with a quick swing.
Then very gently, slowly, and with care, turn it upside down over the
saucer, leaving it there for a minute, so that all the moisture may
drain away.

Some divinators of the tea-leaves insist on a concentration of the mind
during this turning of the cup, as do many cartomantes whilst the cards
are being shuffled; others prefer the mind to be as far as possible free
from any definite thought or desire, simply allowing it to dwell on such
abstract subjects as flowers or the weather. Personally, I advocate this
for both systems of divination; it enables the subconscious mind to
assert itself unhindered, whilst the normal mind is in abeyance.

The turning of the cup before inverting it over the saucer is equivalent
to the shuffling of the cards. It is as a direct result of those few
seconds turning that the pictures and signs are created, the
subconscious mind directing the hand holding the cup. The following
simple ritual is all that is necessary to those consulting the
tea-leaves.

The cup to be read is held by the seer and turned about as necessary, so
that the symbols may be read without disturbing them. This is important,
but no disturbance will take place if the moisture has been properly
drained away. The handle of the cup represents the consultant, also the
home, or, if the consultant be away from home the present abode.

It is necessary to have a starting point in the cup for the purpose of
indicating events approaching near to, or far distant from, the person
consulting. The leaves near the rim denote such things as may be
expected to occur quickly; those directly beneath the handle indicate
present and immediate happenings; those on the sides of the cup suggest
more distant events; whilst those at the bottom deal with the far
distant future.

This method of fixing the time, coupled with intuition, renders it
possible to give a consultant some idea as to when an event may be
expected; but if there be no intuitive sense of time, it will be found
wiser not to be too positive.

The turning of the cup and the draining of the moisture having been
carried out as directed, the tea-leaves will be found distributed at the
sides and bottom of the cup.

For those who wish to use the saucer as a further means of divination,
the following suggestions will be useful.

There must be a definite point to represent the consultant, and for this
reason the saucer is usually rejected. There is also the objection that
it is more difficult to manipulate in the turning. Nevertheless, it is
found to give excellent results, and, if the cup is bare of events, it
is useful to be able to find information in the saucer.

First of all, then, to determine the position of the consultant. Take
the centre of the saucer for this purpose. The circle round it
represents the home, or if the consultant is away from home, the present
abode, and also events near at hand. The more distant circle indicates
those things which are not to be expected for some time. The outer
circle and rim suggest events as yet in the misty future.

When the saucer is used as an additional means of seeking knowledge of
coming events, after the symbols in the cup have been exhausted, it will
often be found that this secondary divination confirms or enlarges upon
that which has already been foretold in the cup.

The moisture and leaves drained from the cup, having remained in the
saucer, should be turned by the consultant three times with the same
swirling motion as for the cup, and the moisture carefully poured away.
The saucer should be held inverted for a few seconds, otherwise when it
is placed upright, the remaining moisture will disturb the tea-leaves.
The symbols are read in exactly the same way as in the cup, the only
difference being the positions representing the consultant, the home,
and the indications of time. These have already been explained.




CHAPTER III

GENERAL THEORIES IN READING THE CUP


At first sight the interior of the cup will show the leaves scattered
about apparently haphazard and with no arrangement; just a jumble of
tea-leaves and nothing more. In reality they have come to their
positions and have taken on the shapes of the symbols for which they
stand, by the guidance of the subconscious mind directing the hand in
the turning of the cup.

The various shapes and the meanings to be attached to them will at first
be puzzling to beginners. A good deal of practice is necessary before
the tea-leaf symbols can be accurately interpreted at a glance. That,
however, will come later, and in time it will be as easy as reading a
book.

If you wish to be a proficient reader of the tea-leaves, practise
constantly this interpretation of the shapes and positions of the
leaves. Take a cup and follow out the simple instructions for the
turning and draining of it, and then carefully study the result.

It is an excellent plan to make a rough copy of the leaves as they
present themselves to you in each cup, making notes of the various
meanings.

Do not feel dismayed if, when you begin looking at the tea-leaves, you
are unable to discover in them anything definitely symbolic. It is
certain that nothing will be found if the seer is feeling nervous! Keep
a calm, open mind, and do not be in a hurry, for it is under such
conditions only that a clear reading of the leaves will be possible. In
some cases the symbols are more easily read than in others. Much depends
upon the consultant.

The gift of imagination (by no means to be confused with invention) is
of the greatest possible importance in discerning the symbols which are
of such endless shapes and variety. The seer has to find in the forms of
the tea-leaves a resemblance, sometimes it may be but a faint one, to
natural objects, _e.g._, trees, houses, flowers, bridges, and so
forth. Figures of human beings and animals will frequently be seen, as
will squares, triangles, circles, and also the line of fate.

These signs may be large or small, and the importance of them must be
judged by their relative size and position. Suppose, for instance, that
a small cross should be at the bottom of the cup, the only one to be
seen, the seer would predict that a trifling vexation or a tiresome
little delay must be expected; but not for the present, as it is at the
bottom of the cup. An alphabetical list of symbols is given later on, so
it is not necessary to define them here. The various points of a more
general character, however, must be studied before it is possible to
give an accurate reading.

It will constantly be found that the stems, isolated leaves, or small
groups of leaves, form a letter of the alphabet, sometimes a number.
These letters and numbers have meanings which must be looked for in
connection with other noticeable signs. If an initial "M" appears, and
near to it a small square or oblong leaf, both being near the rim of the
cup, it would indicate a letter coming speedily from someone whose name
begins with an "M." If the initial appears near the bottom of the cup it
shows that the letter will not be coming for some time.

If there be a clear space at the bottom of the cup devoid of tea-leaves,
it shows water, and that, in all probability, the letter is coming from
abroad. If the symbol of the letter comes very near to a bird flying, it
shows a telegram. If the bird is flying towards the consultant (the
handle), the telegram has been received. The news in it is to be judged
by other signs in the cup. If flying away from the handle, the telegram
is sent by the consultant. A single bird flying always indicates speedy
news.

In a cup with various ominous signs, such as a serpent, an owl, or many
crosses, the news coming is not likely to be pleasant. In a cup without
bad signs, it can safely be said that the news is good.

As a general rule large letters indicate places, whilst smaller ones
give the names of persons. Thus a large letter "E" would stand for
Edinburgh and a smaller "E" for Edwards, for instance. To all rules
there comes the occasional exception, and this principle holds good with
regard to the letters in the tea-cup. It is said that these smaller
letters always point to the first letter of the surname. Usually it is
so; but I have constantly found from experience that it is the first
letter of the Christian name, or even a pet name, to which the letter
refers. It is well to keep this possibility in mind, otherwise the seer
may give misleading information to consultants.

Sometimes numbers mean the date for an event to be expected, a "5" for
instance, very near the brim of the cup, or the handle (the consultant),
means in five days; or five weeks if it come on the side, possibly as
far off as five months if the figure be at the bottom of the cup.

As dots around a symbol always indicate money in some form or another,
according to the character of the symbol, a figure beside the dots would
signify the amount of money to be expected. If the symbol were that of a
legacy with the figure "90" near, it would show that a little legacy of
ninety pounds might be anticipated.

Clearly defined symbols that stand out separately are of more importance
than such as are difficult to discern. Clusters of shapeless leaves
represent clouds marring the effect of an otherwise fortunate cup.

Journeys are shown by lines or dots formed by the dust and smaller
leaves of the tea. The length and direction of the journey may be known
by the extent of the line and, roughly speaking, the point of the
compass to which it leads, the handle in this case representing south.
If the line of dots ascends sharply to the brim of the cup, a journey to
a hilly country will be taken.

Supposing the consultant to be at home, and the dots form a line from
the handle all round the cup and back to the handle, it signifies a
journey for a visit and the return. If the line were to stop before
reaching the handle again, with an appearance of a house where the line
ends, a change of residence might safely be predicted. A wavy line shows
indecision as to arrangements. Crosses upon the line indicate that there
will be vexation or delay in connection with the journey. Large flat
leaves some distance apart along the line stand for important stations
to be passed through.

For some consultants there seems very little of interest to be read in
their cup. There are no events, merely trivialities. It is therefore
difficult to find anything that could be considered as "future," when it
seems to be just a dead level "present," the daily life, nothing more.
It is sad for those who have such a dull life, but there is usually some
sign, a small happening such as a parcel, or a visit from a friend.
These must be made the most of. The pleasure of anticipation will add to
the realisation.

A confused looking tea-cup, without any definite symbols, just a muddle
of tea-leaves, is useless for the purpose of divination, beyond giving
an indication of the state of the consultant's mind, so vague and
undecided in its character that it obscures everything. Tell such a one
the reason for the failure of divining, and recommend a more reliable
state of mind. Then let them try their "fortune" again in a few months,
when it may be found quite different.

It is of course a great mistake to be always "looking in the
tea-leaves," as some foolish people do twice a day. It is sure to lead
to contradictions though there is no harm in the habit of "looking in
the cup" each morning as others do, for finding the events likely to
happen in the course of the day. This is as permissible as the reading
of the cards each morning for the day's events by those who consider it
a safeguard, remembering that to be forewarned is to be forearmed.

Some people use the tea-cup simply for the purpose of asking a definite
question, such as, "Is the sum of money I am expecting coming soon?"
When this is the case, the consultant should be told before turning the
cup in the hand to concentrate the thoughts on this one point, as in the
case of wishing while shuffling the cards for a definite wish. Then the
seer must look only for the signs that will give the answer to the
question, ignoring all other points. This is necessary for the giving of
a satisfactory answer to the question asked.




CHAPTER IV

DIVINATION BY TEA-LEAVES AS AN AMUSEMENT AND AS A MORE SERIOUS STUDY


The need for patience cannot be too strongly impressed upon those who
are beginning to learn the language of tea-leaves. Some of the most
interesting symbols are very minute, and will certainly be missed by the
seer who is in a hurry.

When tea-leaf reading is indulged in merely as an amusement to while
away a few moments after a meal, a hasty glance at the cup, or cup and
saucer, will suffice. The seer will just note the chief features, such
as a journey, a letter, a parcel, or news of a wedding, and pass on to
the next cup. But this is far from being a really interesting method of
divination by tea-leaves, wherein so much knowledge is to be found, and
so much useful information gained.

Those who closely study this fascinating subject will certainly be well
rewarded by a deep personal interest, in addition to the pleasure they
give to others.

It is wonderful how rapidly converts are made to this form of
divination. Some who in the past have been heard scornfully to assert
that they "have no belief in tea-leaves," become the most regular
inquirers. Moreover, these sceptics have proved to be very efficient
students.

There is always a satisfaction in persuading another to one's own point
of view. The more obstinate the opposition, the more glorious the final
conquest!

It is a rare occurrence nowadays to meet with three people in the course
of a day, and not to find that one at least is deeply interested in
fortune-telling in some of its various forms.

Quite recently I had a letter from a girl who has gone on a visit to
British Columbia, asking me if I would "do the cards" for her, as she
could not find anyone in her vicinity who was particularly good at
divination. She went on to say that "there is a perfect rage for
fortune-telling out here, and everyone is keen on it." Another instance
of this universal popularity was given to me by a friend who had
recently been to America. She was amazed at the numbers of women whom
she saw absorbed in the reading of their tea-cups each day of the
voyage.

The male sex holds aloof and leaves us to "perform these follies." Some
ascribe it to man's superiority. Or as briefly summed up by a delightful
member of their sex, who when declaiming against the possibility of the
future being made visible, said, "With all apologies to you, I must say
I am not so profoundly stupid as to believe in these things; it cannot
be anything more than rot."

It is remarkable how such protests die away when clairvoyant evidence,
either by cards, tea-leaves, or other means, has accurately predicted
some event of the distant future that at the time appeared absurd and
impossible of happening.

Woman may lawfully claim superiority with regard to her intuitive
faculty, and thus she is well equipped for exercising her divinatory
powers.

Who need be dull or bored when the language of symbolism remains to be
learned? Perhaps I should say, studied; for completely learned it can
never be, seeing that fresh events are constantly occurring in the
world, and new symbols appear representing each.

There are few things more fascinating than personal discovery, and those
who become students of divination by tea-leaves, or cards, may safely be
promised a taste of this pleasing sensation of achievement. It is
limited to the few to discover the marvels of radium, or the discomforts
of the South Pole, but a fragment of their glory is shared by those who
find new evidence of the far-reaching knowledge of symbolism.




CHAPTER V

SOME HINTS FOR DIVINERS

REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF PROPHECY BY THE TEA-LEAVES

  "For a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more
  than seven watchmen that sit above in a high tower."


To those of an inquiring or doubting turn of mind, there may arise the
very natural question as to _why_ one shaped tea-leaf should mean
"a hat" and another "a table." It is useless to point out that these
objects are perfectly represented by the leaves. That is of no practical
satisfaction. The simple fact that each language has its alphabet, its
spelling, and its words, which must be learned before there can be any
reasonable understanding of it, seems the best and obvious reply.

Symbolism is a wide subject with many branches. Who can expect to master
even its alphabet in a moment? To those who cannot accept the symbols in
the tea-leaves on the authority of past experience, reaching over
several centuries, I would recommend a careful study of their cups for,
say, three months. Let them make notes of such signs as appear and
beside them place their meanings and predictions.

At the end of this time, compare all that has taken place with these
notes, and I think there will be no further lack of faith in the
tea-leaf symbols.

Before very many years have passed the language of symbolism by cards,
tea-leaves, crystal gazing, etc., will probably be almost universally
understood. The day will undoubtedly come when it will be accepted as
naturally as the English language, and we shall cease to worry ourselves
as to the why and wherefore of it all.

It is important that those who are learning the art of divination by
tea-leaves should realise the necessity for consistently attributing the
same meanings to the symbols. Do not be tempted to change their
interpretation for what may seem a more probable, or pleasant,
prediction for your client. It is a fatal mistake.

Remember that you are dealing with conditions and events of the future
which are outside the limited knowledge of the normal mind, whose power
of vision is limited to physical sight.

A simple instance of what may occur, should you thus change the meanings
of the symbols, will suffice to show the folly of such a practice.

A consultant comes to have her "fortune read." She is known to you
personally, and you are aware that she is anxious to hear a hopeful
report of someone dear to her who is ill. The tea-leaf symbols are
obstinately unfavourable, and display ominous signs of forthcoming
sorrow. If you gloss over this fact completely, and predict a rapid
recovery from the illness, what becomes of your client's faith in the
power of foretelling the future? Certain it is that the symbols would be
right in their verdict, and you would be wrong.

It is usually easier to prophesy smooth things rather than unpleasant
facts, but to do this in the face of obvious contradictions will lead to
disaster in foretelling the future.

Divination by tea-leaves or cards has the candour to be frankly
disagreeable when necessary. This is one great argument in favour of its
unerring truthfulness. There is no means by which symbols may be coaxed
into proclaiming false statements.

The most practised clairvoyant may occasionally make mistakes in her
reading of the symbols, but no genuine seer should ever deliberately
give a wrong interpretation of them to please her consultant. The
business of the diviner is to give what she believes to be a correct and
unprejudiced translation of the symbols before her.

It is sometimes a vexed question as to what extent information of a
gloomy nature, which may appear in a divination, should be given to a
client. Some are in favour of withholding such matter altogether, whilst
others announce it frankly without modification. It seems impossible to
lay down any hard and fast rule. There are so many things to be taken
into account, and each case should be treated on its merits and
according to its peculiar circumstances. There are some who would fret
themselves ill at the least mention of coming misfortune, others would
be the better prepared to meet it by having been warned of its approach.

One rule can be safely made for guidance on this point. Do not minimise
danger when a timely warning may avert an accident, or other misfortune,
nor should symbols of ill omen be exaggerated. As students become
proficient, they will find many meanings in the tea-leaves in addition
to those which they learn from this book. Much will depend upon
circumstances and individual temperaments.

These personally discovered meanings should be carefully noted and
verified with events as they occur.

It is necessary to remember that divination by the tea-cup is by no
means limited to personal information. Forthcoming public events are
frequently revealed. This adds largely to the interest and usefulness of
the divination. It is important to point out this to consultants, so
that they may not be too ready to fix the whole reading of their cups to
purely personal matters. It will be found that public news is usually
foretold in the cups of those who seek information of the future as a
regular practice.

For those who rarely do so, private affairs alone will appear, probably
without even a forecast of the weather to be expected within the next
few days.

It is a curious fact that the wider knowledge should seem to be reserved
for those who practise divination constantly, but so it is.

Some remarkable instances of the accurate foretelling of public events,
which have quite recently been brought to my notice, may be interesting.

For some weeks before the coal strike of 1920 was declared, a pickaxe
was seen on several occasions in the cups of two persons, both of whom
read their tea-leaves regularly. This symbol, as will be seen in the
dictionary which follows, stands for "labour trouble and strikes." A
spade was also in evidence at intervals, a further sign of "trouble and
unrest." So that it was through no fault of the tea-leaves if some of us
were not in the superior position of knowing all about the strike before
it came to pass.

The symbols already mentioned would of course apply equally to railway
disturbance, and some time before the threat of a strike was announced,
these symbols appeared again, together with an engine, and a signal at
the angle of "Danger." This seemed ominous. But within a few days the
signal was evident once more; but on this occasion set at "All Clear."
So it was easy to decide that the threatened strike would not take
place. The accuracy of this prediction by means of the tea-leaves was
shortly afterwards made evident.

Again, a week before there seemed to be even a hope of a settlement of
the coal strike, a mining shaft presented itself in one of the tea-cups
which had previously been indicating the strike. This symbol appeared at
the top of the cup standing out clearly by itself, evidently predicting
the miners' return to work within a short time. There was no need to
depend upon information from the newspapers as to the end of the strike,
for here in the tea-leaves was all necessary evidence of the fact.

Another very remarkable instance of symbolism was given to me by a
friend a short time ago. On Monday morning, October 26th, 1920, the
three following symbols appeared in her cup:--

  A vulture resting on a rock.
  An eagle.
  A monkey.


In the evening of that day the death of King Alexander of Greece was
announced.

It will be seen, on referring to the dictionary, that an eagle and a
vulture signify "the death of a monarch." The monkey who lay at the
bottom of the cup, apparently dead, was of course the third symbol as
having caused the King's death. It was particularly gratifying that
these signs should have appeared in my friend's cup for she is a
mathematical genius, and rejects every symbol which she cannot recognise
at once. She was so struck by these signs that she called them to the
attention of her mother, who also immediately perceived and identified
them. The only regrettable omission was that the cup was not
photographed. It would have been valuable evidence for the wonders of
the tea-leaves.

This same friend had another interesting experience. The head of an
Indian appeared in her cup, with other signs pointing to news of a
personal nature. She was puzzled, for, as far as she knew, there was no
one in India from whom she would be in the least likely to hear.

Very shortly afterwards, however, her mother went on a visit to London.
There she quite unexpectedly met someone who had recently come from
India, and who had brought back messages of remembrance and affection
from a girl who my friend had no idea was in India at that time. Hence
the Indian in her tea-cup!

Whilst on this subject, I am reminded of another occasion when India was
represented in the tea-leaves. I was looking into my tea-cup one day,
when I saw most clearly depicted two natives creeping stealthily, their
attitude making this evident. In their hands were what appeared to be
knives, and they were making towards a figure that was unmistakably that
of an officer. He was standing upon what looked like a raised platform
with a barricade round him. He held a revolver in his hand.

I am quite aware that some may think this a tall tale for the tea-leaves
to relate! But fortunately my reading of the cup was witnessed by two
others, one of them being a man, who, although interested in psychic
subjects, despises the tea-leaves! Without remarking upon what I saw, I
suggested that he should look at my cup and see what he made of it.
Without a moment's hesitation he said, "There is an officer defending
himself against some natives who are about to attack him."

My readers will appreciate the satisfaction this testimony gave me,
coming as it did from one who had never before looked into a cup.
Moreover, that this witness should have been one of the male sex added
to its value! This prediction of danger for someone in India was borne
out by facts that were disclosed shortly afterwards. These instances
which I have given illustrate the variety and interest which are to be
found in divination by tea-leaves.




CHAPTER VI

WRITING IN THE TEA-LEAVES

SOME FREQUENT SYMBOLS


Another source through which messages are received by the tea-leaves
will be found in the writing which will be seen from time to time.
Moreover, it has the great advantage of being clear and easy to
decipher, so that there may be no doubt of what is intended to be
understood by it. The tea-leaves can never be accused of being
illegible. Occasionally it is very minute writing, and would probably be
passed over by those who read their cups in a superficial manner. To
those who study them carefully the future is revealed.

No one would reasonably expect to find a speech from the Prime Minister
or an invitation to a tea-party written for them in the tea-leaves. But
words they certainly will find.

A short time ago I saw in my cup, in perfect copperplate writing, the
word "wait." I was annoyed by it, for what is more annoying than having
to wait? Sometimes it may happen that the tea-leaves--as with their
relatives, the tumbler and automatic writing--become a little shaky in
their spelling. But this is not a serious defect, and the trifling
errors do not prevent the word from being translatable. It is a
recognised fact that writing seen through a medium, whether it be
tea-leaves, or a dream, is of importance, and should always be regarded
with attention and with an endeavour to understand its message.

I should like to point out that certain figures and symbols are of so
frequent occurrence that it may be well to emphasise their general
significance by referring to them here, in addition to their meaning
being given in the dictionary.

Among those which threaten misfortune, or sorrow, are the following:
Crosses, snakes, spades, pistols, guns, toads, cats.

Joy and success are indicated by such symbols as a crescent moon, clover
leaves, flowers, trees, anchors, fruit, circles, stars.

Having learned the symbols and the combined symbols by heart, it will
require only a little practice to interpret their meanings without
hesitation. For those who find difficulty in committing the dictionary
to memory, an essential for proficient reading of the cup, I would
suggest that they write down any meaning which may seem specially hard
to remember, roughly drawing its symbol beside it. In this way the
difficulty will soon be overcome.




CHAPTER VII

THE "NELROS" CUP

TWO EXAMPLE READINGS OF ITS SIGNS

  "If thou wouldst learn thy future with thy tea,
   This magic cup will show it thee."


Some readers may find an additional interest in divination by
tea-leaves, if they use a cup marked with the planetary symbols,
patented as the "Nelros Cup of Fortune." A short explanation of the
symbols, and the method of using this cup, will be helpful for those who
are not familiar with its signs. I am not suggesting the use of the
"Nelros" saucer, for the reason that its signs are somewhat obscure, and
students who have no experience in the science of astrology would find
it confusing, if used in addition to the cup, in which all needful signs
are illustrated.

As in the case of the ordinary tea-cup, the handle remains as the
representative of the consultant. The turning of it and draining of the
moisture should be carried out in the usual way.

Immediately under the handle, and above the space given to the Sun, are
seen a Diamond and a Horseshoe. Next on the left are a Snake twisted
round a stick, and a Spade, these being placed over the space given to
Saturn.

Following them are a Bell and a Club, seen over the sign of Venus. Next,
an Eye and Envelope, above the space given to Jupiter.

Then comes a Cross, with the sign of Pisces, the Fishes, these being
over the sign of Mercury.

Next are a Winecup and a Spider above the space of Mars.

Followed by a Cat's Head and a Heart, above the Moon.

Each one of these signs round the brim has a symbolic meaning, though
their meaning must also be judged by the position they occupy in the
cup.

Now, taking the signs round the brim of the cup, and connecting them
with the planetary symbols beneath.

Beginning at the handle is a Diamond, this being a token of wealth,
which, with the sign of the Sun below, indicates much prosperity,
favours, and general well-being, the Horseshoe over the Sun also
betokening good luck and successful projects.

In the next space, reading to the left, is the Snake twisted round a
stick, over the sign of Saturn. This is emblematical of a risk of
poverty coming through deceit, and with a Spade over Saturn, whose
characteristic is privation, there is a further indication of toil,
loss, undoing.

The next sign is a happier one; the Bell over the sign of Venus, with
the Club beyond, indicates joyful news, events meaning much happiness,
love and peace, the characteristic of Venus being peace or placidity.

Next is the sign of Jupiter, whose characteristic is expansion; above it
are placed an Eye and an Envelope, the Eye showing the power of
penetration, seeing things in a right perspective, and light thrown on
difficult questions, the letter showing that news from all parts of the
world is made possible by its expansion.

Next come the Latin Cross and the watery sign Pisces, the Fishes. These
being in connection with Mercury, whose characteristic is activity, show
much alertness and desire for knowledge; the Cross meaning obstacles and
hindrances in the chosen path, whilst the sign of Pisces denotes
interesting news from distant lands, with much desire for travel and
exploration.

In the next space the Winecup and Spider, in connection with the sign of
Mars, the characteristic of Mars being energy, show the strength,
courage, and perseverance needed to carry out a successful career; the
Spider being a symbol of concentration, patience, and achievement,
whilst the Wine-cup tells of joy and realised ambition.

Following these signs are the Cat's Head and the Heart, with the
Crescent Moon below. The characteristic of the Moon is change, mobility;
it is also a symbol of good fortune in the tea-leaves. In combination
with the Heart it indicates a romantic love affair. The Cat's Head shows
interference by those who are mean and spiteful.

Having learned from this brief explanation the symbols of the "Nelros
Cup," the reading of the tea-leaves in relation to those symbols will be
easy. For instance, suppose the wife of a sailor to be the consultant.
Her husband is on his ship in the North Sea, and she is eagerly awaiting
news of him. In the cup she has "turned," the symbol of a letter comes
in the watery sign [Symbol: )-(] with a large ivy leaf beneath it.
Further patience will be necessary, the ivy leaf tells us, as the
wished-for letter is still far away. The distance from the handle (the
consultant) shows this, also the letter symbol being in the watery sign
indicates the fact that it will come from across the sea. The waiting
for the news causes a feeling of disappointment and sadness; these will
vanish later on, and the waiting be compensated by the happy news that
will come in the longed-for letter. This is seen by the tea-leaves which
appear on other symbols of the cup.

The form of a man is seen between the signs of the Bell and Club; near
this form is the letter "A," the first letter of the consultant's name.
Round this initial letter is a well-formed circle; a trident lies at a
little distance from it.

Here is evidence of the joyful news coming from her husband, the
tea-leaves in the spaces of the Bell and Club making a prediction of the
satisfactory news a safe one. The circle round the letter "A" and the
symbol of the trident near, enable the seer to prophesy a good
promotion, much success and happiness.

This example reading of the "Nelros" cup is a fortunate one. We will now
consider one of a less satisfactory character.

The consultant is a widow; opposite the handle of the cup she has
"turned" is the Envelope over Jupiter, upon the Envelope tea-leaves
forming an Owl are seen, beneath is a small arrow pointing towards the
handle. These signs foretell bad news probably coming from a far
country; the sign of Jupiter and distance from the handle (the
consultant) would show this. The symbol of the Owl indicates the anxiety
caused by the arrival of the letter and its news. The arrow pointing
towards the handle would show that the matter is personal, and will much
affect the consultant.

Upon the sign of Saturn, with an arm stretched towards the Spade above
it, is the figure of a man. The characteristic of Saturn being
privation, and the Spade being a symbol of toil, it is evident that the
figure of the man represents someone related to the consultant for whom
the present prospects are very bad. It may well be this man from whom is
coming the news in the letter which will cause her so much anxiety.

Fortunately, on the Anchor at the bottom of the cup is a well-formed
key. Being in this position, it shows that someone at a distance, having
the welfare of the consultant much in their mind, will be the means in
the future of helping her out of the difficulties. The key being on the
Anchor indicates the security she may feel in the friends, who will be
instrumental in giving her happiness and peace of mind.

These two example divinations will illustrate the manner in which the
tea-leaves are read in relation to the signs upon the cup. To some it
may appear an easier means than that of the ordinary tea-cup.

In any case it is very useful to have an alternative method of
foretelling the future. Variety is always acceptable, and for this
reason I commend the "Nelros Cup of Fortune" to my readers.

SOME EXAMPLE CUPS WITH THEIR INTERPRETATIONS

The following twenty illustrations are photographs of cups which on
various occasions have been turned by consultants and interpreted by a
seer. The student will find these of much practical value in learning
what symbols to look for, and how to discern them clearly as the cup is
turned about in the hand.

The divination of each cup should be carefully studied with its
illustration; by this means the student will be enabled to grasp the
principles upon which to form a judgment of the cup as a whole.

Having mastered this, the knowledge gained can be supplemented by
reference to the alphabetical Dictionary of Symbols and Their Meanings
in the previous chapter.

To study the illustrations and their descriptions correctly, the former
must be turned about and about until each symbol has been identified.




TWENTY ILLUSTRATIONS

WITH THEIR INTERPRETATIONS




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE I


The most noticeable feature of this cup is the clear evidence given that
the chief interests of the consultant are bound up in some man in India.
That there is delay in receiving important news from him is shown by the
symbol of the pigeon on the stone immediately beneath the handle. But
that most favourable news may be expected later is certain, for the
figure of a man upon an elephant with a pineapple beyond gives proof of
this. The natives with the large "P" in conjunction show that the
Punjaub is indicated, and this is further emphasised by the sign-post
which points towards these symbols. The child's toys show the
consultant's association and happiness with children. The figure of the
woman seated on the edge of a rock with its curious peak behind her, and
the seagull below, suggest that storms at sea will cause distress to
some woman known to the consultant. The small figure "11," close to this
symbol, points out that it is likely to be eleven days before there is
hope of the anxiety being relieved.

[Illustration: FIGURE I]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Natives on post. Large letter "P." Child's toys. Woman
with uplifted hands on curious shaped rock. Small numeral "11" above.
Seagull perched on small rock beneath.

_In centre_.--Pigeon standing on large stone, man in sun helmet on
elephant. Sign-post pointing to letter "P."

_Near rim and handle_.--A pineapple on dish.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE II


This cup shows that a variety of events may be expected, with a fair
proportion of pleasure and success to be anticipated from them.

The finger beyond the handle pointing to the ark indicates that in all
trials the consultant will find a refuge. The hanging lamp is also a
guarantee of coming success, and prosperous undertakings, in some new
plan which is under consideration.

The clouds, the symbol of the goat beyond which is facing into the open
gateway, signify that an advantageous opportunity, to which a certain
amount of risk is attached, awaits the consultant; the prominent
figurehead upon the stone pillar gives assurance that all will turn out
well, and that there is no need for hesitation in embarking upon this
new opportunity; that it will necessitate a removal is shown by the
buildings beyond. The quill pen and dots point to the fact that some
legal business will be transacted over money affairs.

The dove-cot in the centre, with the form of a widow with dots around,
signifies that a benefit to the home may be expected in the future,
through a widow. The clergyman in conjunction, holding a paper, shows
that the benefit will probably come about through a reconciliation. The
bank of clouds behind the ferry boat shows that some trouble, to be
expected in the future, will be lightened by the help of good friends.
Whilst the bird stationary upon the piece of wood, at some distance from
the consultant, and in conjunction with the letter "L," means
uncertainty as to some desired information, which should come from
someone whose name begins with "L."

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Finger. Small ark. Hanging lamp and shade. Large
arm-chair. Bank of clouds. Goat. Large open gateway. Curious shaped
figurehead upon a stone pillar. Low curved wall and buildings. Small
quill pen and dots.

_In centre_.--Dove-cot. Widow in flowing veil seated in chair. Dots
around. Man in clerical hat holding an open paper in his hand.

_Near rim_.--Shapeless leaves. Small ferry boat on water. Bird
standing on log of wood. Letter "L."




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE III


The cat with dots around being near the handle indicates financial worry
in the home. The bone beyond shows that the misfortunes will be met with
courage, and eventually overcome. The cockatoo, with the cauliflower
appearing on the opposite side, signifies that an unreliable friend will
cause the consultant a little uneasiness, and as a small symbol of a
mushroom is beside it, a quarrel with this undesirable friend may be
expected.

The pear may be linked to the symbol of the font in the centre of the
cup, showing that the consultant may expect news of a birth; the carving
indicates that the news will give much satisfaction; the wine-cup, with
the leg in conjunction, points out that the ambitions of the consultant
will certainly be realised in the future. That a certain amount of
waiting will be necessary is shown by the distance from the handle.

The motor boat, and monument in the centre, foretell the successful
outcome of a new venture, which at present is unthought-of. The rocks
show that a certain amount of mental agitation is aroused by the setting
out on this undertaking, but, with the reassuring symbols in this cup,
no alarm is necessary.

[Illustration: FIGURE III]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On side under handle_.--Cat. Scattered dots.

_On side_.--Bone. Cockatoo upon a stump of wood. Small symbol of a
leg. Wine-cup held in hand. Small symbol of a mushroom. Pear.
Cauliflower.

_On circle under handle_.--Curious shaped rocks.

_On circle beyond_.--Monument.

_In centre_.--Motor boat. Font. Carved figures.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE IV


The symbol of the seal being directly under the handle, with the large
arch and carving beyond, show that the consultant will soon enjoy the
fulfilment of a long desired hope; everything is going smoothly, and
will turn out as desired. The only obstacle is seen in the symbol of the
weasel, which appears beyond the seal, pointing to the fact that the
consultant has someone who is not to be trusted in the home, but this
will not result in anything serious.

The figures of the two women opposite the handle show the arrival of
friends to the "house," bringing presents with them. The inkpot, pen,
and numeral "7," with the bird's nest in connection, show that happy
news, as the result of personal effort on the part of the consultant,
may be looked for within seven days.

The rock, motor, and wavy lines being in conjunction, warn the
consultant of some forthcoming vexation, and possibly alarm, in
connection with a motor expedition, but the episode is in the distance,
and will not be more than a passing cloud.

The slug, at the bottom of the cup, predicts a future disturbance with
someone, but the matter will be trifling. The large symbol of the king
and queen upon the throne, opposite the handle, foretells a future of
honour and wealth, and the assurance of every happiness for this
fortunate consultant.

[Illustration: FIGURE IV]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Opposite handle on circle_.--Two women, inside figure carrying
basket, outside figure with parcel under arm.

_On sides_.--Line of wavy dots. Large rock. Motor. Bird's nest.
Pen. Numeral "7." Inkpot.

_On circle_.--Large arch with carving.

_In centre_.--Slug. Figures of King and Queen on throne.

_Under handle_.--Seal. Weasel.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE V


The large rock on the side, with the letter "J" beside it, speaks of a
forthcoming vexation or trouble caused by someone whose name begins with
"J." The necklace and jewellery beyond, with scattered dots around, give
a cheerful assurance to the consultant of coming prosperity. This is
further emphasised by the circle of dots above the letter "C" in the
centre. As the initial is large, it probably indicates the name of the
place from which the source of wealth may be anticipated; and that much
happiness will come to the consultant in the future, is shown by the
dancing figure and carved figures being in conjunction.

The small basket, the sausage, and roll of bread, with the query and "2"
beyond, all point to the fact that the consultant will have little
complaints and grumbles to put up with, and there will be some doubt as
to which of two people is most to blame. But it will be only a small
ripple upon the otherwise smooth surface of the consultant's outlook.

[Illustration: FIGURE V]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Large rocks. Letter "J" in conjunction. Necklace.
Jewellery.

_In centre_.--Large ornamental "C." Circle of dots above. Figure of
girl dancing with arm upraised beneath. Carved figures.

_In centre near circle_.--Basket. Large sausage with roll of bread
in conjunction. Small query. Numeral "2."




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE VI


The numeral "4," beside the shapeless leaves, and the line leading from
this to the flat rock beyond, indicate that in about four days the
consultant may expect to meet with obstacles in the way of some
prospective outing or pleasure, which will probably fall through.

The corkscrew, with the letter "C" in conjunction, signifies vexatious
curiosity as to the consultant's private concerns, on the part of
persons whose names begin with these initials. But that it is merely a
passing annoyance is shown by the symbol of the arch, and dancing
figures above it, and, with the fig tree beyond, foretells the
development of things most wished for, and much future happiness and
prosperity.

The anvil in the centre, with the branches of a tree in conjunction,
suggests that it will be largely owing to the consultant's energy that
this hopeful outlook in the future may safely be predicted.

[Illustration: FIGURE VI]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Corkscrew. Letter "C." Arch. Dancing figures above.
Fig tree.

_Near rim_.--Shapeless leaves. Numeral "4." Line leading to flat
rock.

_In centre_.--Anvil. Branches of a tree.

_Under handle_.--Scattered dots.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE VII


Although the small symbol of the dagger points towards the consultant,
it would not in this case predict a personal danger, as there are no
further signs of illness or misfortune. So that it may safely be taken
to mean that the consultant will shortly be going to see a friend who
has had an operation; this fact is borne out by the short dotted line
beyond, leading to the door knocker, under which is written the word
"in."

The numeral "7" coming at the end of the dotted line would show that it
will probably be seven weeks before this friend recovers from the
illness. This friend's name is shown to begin with "L," as that letter
is also near the end of the lines.

The more distant signs of a brooch and a cabinet beyond both foretell
the unexpected development of good fortune. If the consultant is
married, the thimble in the centre would show future changes in the
household; that they will be advantageous is shown by the large feather
which gives assurance of a prosperous future.

That this may come about through a friend, or lover, is shown by the
cigar, and is further emphasised by the large dots beside it.

A warning against extravagance, however, is given to the consultant by
the crinoline, which appears amidst these signs of future wealth.

[Illustration: FIGURE VII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Near rim_.--Small dagger. Short dotted line leading to door
knocker, with "in" written beneath. Numeral "7." Letter "L." Dots.

_On sides near circle_.--Group of dots and small symbols showing
presents. Brooch. Cabinet.

_In centre_.--Crinoline. Large feather. Small cigar. Thimble.

_Under handle_.--Symbols of letters and parcels.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE VIII


The only definite indication of future prospects is shown by the symbol
of the organ, and acorn, upon the circle at the bottom of the cup, the
position of these signs showing that hope will not be realised for some
time.

But these symbols make the prediction of ultimate success a safe one.
Should the consultant be a musician, triumph in the profession would be
assured.

The coal scoop and beetle are significant of domestic worries and
household cares. But the tea cosy in the centre promises compensation in
the way of small comforts and affection.

[Illustration: FIGURE VIII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

Small symbol of a coal scoop.

_On circle_.--Organ. Acorn beside it. Beetle.

_In centre_.--Tea cosy.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE IX


This cup would be singularly disappointing from the consultant's point
of view, as it is devoid of incident.

The large spray of thistle on the rim indicates an unselfish life of
endurance. For the present, there is no sign of a more eventful
existence.

The dust-pan, brush, and duster, in the centre, point to future domestic
vexations, but the large spray of iris beside it promises a pleasure
which will far outbalance the trifling disturbance.

[Illustration: FIGURE IX]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Near rim_.--Thistle.

_Centre_.--Dust-pan and brush. Duster. Large spray of iris.

_Under handle_.--Shapeless leaves.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE X


The most striking features of this cup are the various indications of
pleasure and social enjoyment. These being shown by the cake and
butterfly, while the orchid in conjunction predicts that the
consultant's personal charm and power of attraction will result in a
future of wealth and social distinction.

The pillar, near the rim and handle, gives a pleasing assurance of
security and loyal friends. The bird flying from the cage brings joyful
news, that something which has been an obstacle in the way of the
consultant's desires is about to be removed, and much future happiness
may be looked for.

The figure of the man fishing from a rock foreshows the arrival of a
visitor, who will have some pleasant news to tell.

The toque opposite the handle, but at the bottom of the cup, gives
further evidence of the good luck coming to this fortunate consultant.

[Illustration: FIGURE X]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Near rim_.--Small stone pillar. Cake on dish. Man on rock fishing.

_On sides_.--Bird cage, small bird flying from it.

_On circle_.--Butterfly. Lady's hat.

_In centre_.--Orchid with long stalk.

_Under handle_.--Shapeless leaves.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XI


This cup indicates that the consultant is apt to be ruffled by trifles
and to become upset by anything unexpected. As, for instance, in the
case of the arrival of visitors, shown by the mass of leaves and chair.
The query beside it shows the indecision of the consultant's mind as to
necessary arrangements. The boots on the opposite side denote that lack
of income will not trouble the consultant.

But that there is some misfortune or hindrance in the future is shown by
the symbol of the broken cross in the bottom of the cup; the head and
shoulders of the woman beside it suggest that this trouble will be
caused by a woman. Compensation will be found in the happy love affair,
which is clearly predicted by the cherries, the figures of the man and
woman embracing, and the man's hat and pipe.

Large dots signify that wealth will be added to happiness. This event
must not be expected for some months, as the symbols are in the bottom
of the cup.

The letter "N" with the dots and small tree beyond show an immediate
pleasant happening, in connection with a person whose name begins with
that letter.

[Illustration: FIGURE XI]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Near rim_.--Mass of leaves. Stones.

_On sides_.--Chair. Query. Two boots.

_On circle_.--Figure of man and woman embracing. Small bunch of
cherries beneath. Several dots. Man's hat and pipe in conjunction.

_In centre_.--Broken cross. Head and shoulders of woman.

_Under handle_.--Letter "N." Small tree beyond.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XII


The present conditions of this consultant are not cheering. The large
cloud, associated with dots, the small dog on the opposite side, and the
policeman beyond, all point to grievous money worries, possibly caused
by dishonesty.

The somewhat indistinct axe implies a brave effort to overcome, and
final mastery of, some of the difficulties.

However, the future has more pleasant prospects, and may be looked
forward to with hope. The symbols of the clover and cherries, give
assurance of this.

The spray of ivy speaks of the patience with which the present trials
are borne, also that true friends are a source of comfort to the
consultant.

[Illustration: FIGURE XII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On side_.--Small dog lying down.

_Near rim_.--Policeman. Indistinct symbol of an axe. Large cloud.
Dots.

_Centre_.--Two small butterflies. Small symbol of a stocking. Small
bunch of cherries. Spray of ivy. Clover.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XIII


The consultant who has "turned" this cup must be prepared for delays,
and must not expect real happiness until rather late in life, this being
shown by the bonnet and strings on the side of the cup.

The small symbol of birds on a perch gives further evidence that having
to wait is a feature of the consultant's lot. The rock and pipe beyond
show some dismay with regard to a dear friend.

The large spray of mistletoe and holly at the bottom of the cup, with
the letters "F" and "L" in conjunction, implies that some event of
importance to the consultant, in connection with persons whose names
begin with these initial letters, will occur in the winter. If the cup
has been "turned" during the autumn or winter, probably a year will pass
before the event takes place, as the mistletoe indicates delay. But this
consultant is prepared to hear the truth, and faces it calmly, even if
it is a little unpleasant; the symbol of the woman looking into the
glass brings this fact to light.

The child playing with its toys foreshows future pleasant plans which
will result in tranquillity and satisfaction.

[Illustration: FIGURE XIII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Bonnet and strings. Birds on perch. Pieces of rock. A
pipe.

_On circle_.--Child with toys.

_Centre_.--Large sprays of mistletoe and holly. Letters "F" and
"L." Figure of woman looking in glass.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XIV


This cup was "turned" by a well-known authoress. Its sinister appearance
is accounted for by the fact that at the time of "turning" the cup, she
was arranging mentally a murder plot for the book she was then writing.

The symbols speak for themselves and need no explanation.

It is a most interesting specimen, as being absolutely unique.

[Illustration: FIGURE XIV]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On side overlapping circle_.--Tail and hindquarters of rat, with
head in a hole. Monster with a man's head and bear's paws.

_On side_.--Dead fish beyond.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XV


The consultant who "turned" this cup was sorrowful and had either just
passed through a bereavement, or such will take place in the immediate
future. The rough cross and the grave near the handle point to this. The
bed, with the figure of the woman in nurse's cloak near it tells of
serious illness in the home. But this is a future trouble, as the
symbols appear at some distance from the handle. The saucepan also bears
witness to the general gloom.

The ivy leaves beyond the rough cross show the patience with which the
consultant bears the trials; also that good and loyal friends will be a
source of comfort.

The small bit of wood and the closed book are symbols of hope, and
assure this sad consultant that the expected improvement in affairs will
certainly take place and will relieve some of the present anxieties.

This is the most that can be foretold of the future, for there are no
signs of pleasant events or definite changes. Indeed, the symbol of the
loaf of bread in the centre of the cup shows that monotony and ordinary
routine are all that can be predicted from the divination.

[Illustration: FIGURE XV]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_Near rim_.--Rough cross. Ivy leaves beyond. Large closed book.

_On sides_.--Log of wood. Bed. Figure of a woman in nurse's cloak
beside it. Grave, with small cross.

_In centre_.--Loaf of bread. Small symbol of a saucepan.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XVI


This cup gives an impression of a somewhat undeveloped character which
is further brought into notice by the stump of a tree on the circle; the
hen on a nest, near the handle, points to a home life of comfort and
affection.

The egg in the cup, and the duck, show that a risk of threatened
disaster, as a result of rash speculation will be averted, and with the
symbol of the three boots, fortunate prospects, and the guarantee of
hope fulfilled, may safely be predicted for the future.

[Illustration: FIGURE XVI]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Hen on nest. Shapeless leaves. Egg in cup.

_Near circle opposite handle_.--A duck.

_On circle_.--Stump of tree. Three boots.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XVII


The figure of the child, with its toys beyond, implies that new plans,
to be made very soon, will be most beneficial, and will bring much
pleasure to the consultant. But as the sausages and snail are not far
distant, there is likely to be a marring of the pleasant conditions,
caused by an act of unfaithfulness on the part of someone with whom the
consultant is closely connected.

The bellows beyond suggest that the matter is treated with as much
philosophy as possible, and with a resolve to make the best of a bad
business; the ham also, being in conjunction, it is evident that the
episode will not interfere with the consultant's success in life.

The sign post, with the running figure beside it and the large letter
"M" beyond, prepare the consultant for startling news, the result of
which will be of great importance. The news will come from a place
beginning with the letter "M." There is no doubt that the matter will
turn out admirably and bring about many advantages, as shown by the
spreading branches of the tree; while the grapes beneath promise
abundant success and joy.

The large boot-tree and latch-key on the circle beneath the handle
predict a fortunate and unexpected gain in the near future. This
consultant may look forward with confidence to the pleasures which fate
has in store.

[Illustration: FIGURE XVII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Child seated. Toys beyond. Sausages. Snail. Ham.
Bellows.

_In centre_.--Sign post. Running figure beside it. Large letter "M"
in conjunction.

_On circle_.--Tree with spreading branches. Bunch of grapes
beneath. Large boot-tree. Latch-key.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XVIII


The shadow beneath the haycock shows that the consultant will soon be
placed in a somewhat trying position and will have considerable
difficulty in finding a way out of it.

The future is full of promise and there can be little doubt that the
consultant will enjoy the pleasures of prosperity.

A journey to a cold climate to be taken later will result in very
propitious news as shown by the symbol of the pheasant.

[Illustration: FIGURE XVIII]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Shapeless leaves. Haycock. Shadow beneath.

_In centre_.--Pair of boots. Spreading branches of a tree. Pheasant
flying.

_Near circle_.--Head of a polar bear.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XIX


The doll on the side, with the small symbol of a toadstool beside it,
gives a warning to the consultant against folly and a bad habit of
gossiping when feeling bored in society. The stuffed head of the deer,
in this case, shows that much distress is caused by the unguarded talk,
and the consultant certainly cannot be described as an "innocent cause."

The various scattered shapeless leaves point to confusion, and a
somewhat "happy-go-lucky" nature. The spray of poppies on the circle
beneath the handle foreshows that a pleasant experience may be expected
in the summer.

The broken gate, with the cross above it, denotes that a new opportunity
which awaits the consultant at a future date, will coincide with a time
of perplexity and trouble, which fact is further borne out by the
running figure below. This being in conjunction with a large letter "Y,"
implies that the disturbance will arise in connection with a place, the
name of which begins with "Y."

[Illustration: FIGURE XIX]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Small symbol of a toadstool. Doll. Head of a stuffed
deer.

_Near rim_.--Many shapeless leaves.

_On circle_.--Spray of poppies.

_In centre_.--Broken gate with cross above it. Large "Y." Running
figure.




INTERPRETATION

FIGURE XX


This cup shows confusion and that the consultant was in a state of
mental turmoil at the time of "turning" it. But in spite of this
drawback there are some interesting facts to be found.

The dotted circles and large ornamental arch point to a most hopeful
outlook and to the successful development of some desire at present
unattainable.

The various initials and small numerals scattered about show
correspondence as to plans and fixing of dates. The bush apple tree
speaks of some pleasure which may be looked forward to in the summer.

The dancing figures predict much future happiness; the numerous changes
which are likely to come about will all tend to success and the
gratifying of the consultant's wishes. And what more cheerful outlook
than this can be desired?

[Illustration: FIGURE XX]

PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS

_On sides_.--Scattered shapeless leaves. Several initials. Small
numerals. Dotted circles. A large ornamental arch.

_Near circle_.--Bush apple tree.

_In centre_.--Dancing and grotesque figures.




CONCLUDING NOTE

It may be safely promised to those who follow the simple instructions
given in this book that within a short time they will find themselves
encircled by a halo of popularity. For few things provide a more certain
guarantee of this pleasant condition than that of being able to "tell
fortunes." Divination by tea-leaves will bring to those who study it
deeply a fund of knowledge beyond the radius of normal understanding.

For those who use it as a means of amusement only, it will give pleasure
which is dependent upon nothing more difficult to obtain than a cup of
tea! With this recommendation I will leave these pages, in the sincere
hope that this little book may be of real value to those who desire to
be initiated into the fascinating art of reading the future in a
tea-cup.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
