[Transcriber's Notes:

_About this book._ Although the title indicates that the Chronicle
begins in 1089, it actually begins in 1189 with the reign of Richard
I, and ends in 1483 with the death of Edward IV. It is based on two
manuscripts, now in the British Library, written by anonymous scribes
in the 15th Century. It recounts events not only in the City of
London--such as the elections of Mayors and Sheriffs--but also in the
British Isles and France, covering battles, coronations, births and
deaths of prominent people, tempests, earthquakes, plagues, and other
noteworthy occurrences.

The Chronicle was first published in 1827, in a limited edition of 250
copies, with copious notes and an extensive section of illustrative
documents. Although the editors of the 1827 edition are not named, the
British Library catalogue identifies them as Sir Nicholas Harris
Nicolas, G.C.M.G., and Edward Tyrrell (whose signature appears at the
end of the dedication).

This e-book was prepared from a 1995 reprint of the 1827 edition,
published by Llanerch Publishers, and from images of the 1827 edition
at the Internet Archive, www.archive.org.

_Orthography._ The Chronicle section is written in 15th-Century
English. The original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and
hyphenation have been preserved in this e-book.

Numbers and dates in lowercase Roman numerals often end in a "j,"
signifying "i."

Superscripted letters are represented in curly brackets preceded by a
carat, e.g., A^{o}.

A crossed double-L is represented as [-ll-], and a tailed Z as [z/].

Blank spaces in the text are represented by long dashes (----).

_Formatting._ The Chronicle section of the original utilizes unique
page headers indicating the name of the monarch and the years covered
on that page, e.g., REX HENRICUS T'CIUS [1238-1242]. These have been
retained in this e-book and inserted in the appropriate chronological
place.

The original contains numerous sidenotes. In the Chronicle section,
sidenotes marked with an asterisk were added by the editors and are
here treated as footnotes. Otherwise, sidenotes are marked as such and
have been moved above the paragraph to which they refer. Where a
paragraph is very long, as in the documents at the end of the Notes
section, the sidenotes have been placed above the lines to which they
refer.]

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, AND COMMON COUNCIL
OF THE CITY OF LONDON.


This Volume presents to your notice an early Chronicle of the great
Metropolis over which you preside.

The rising taste for literature, and particularly that part of it
relating to the History of your ancient City, which has lately been
evinced by you in the formation of a Library, as well as in the
private Collections made by several of your members on the same
subject, renders it probable that the publication of this Chronicle,
which has never before been printed, may not be deemed unacceptable.

Amongst the "Illustrations" will be found some interesting and
important documents taken from the Archives of your Corporation;--they
give a faint idea of the valuable historical information contained in
your Records; and it may be hoped that these specimens will induce you
to follow the example set by the Great Council of the Nation in
printing the Parliamentary Records, and that at no very distant period
measures may be taken for the publication of such of the documents in
your possession as will illustrate the History of England, and of the
City of London.

PREFACE.


The present period is so distinguished for historical research, that
the publication of an English Chronicle, written in the fifteenth
century, will not it is presumed require any other prefatory remarks
to recommend it to attention, than a brief account of the MSS. from
which it has been transcribed. Two copies are extant in the British
Museum; the one in the Harleian MS. 565, the other in the Cottonian
MS. Julius B. I. and the material variations between them are either
alluded to, or inserted in the Notes. The copy in the Harleian MS.
ends with the 22nd year of the reign of Henry the Sixth, Anno 1442,
about which time the volume was evidently written: but the other
transcript, which is in a much later hand, is continued to the death
of Edward the Fourth, Anno 1483, though after the accession of that
monarch the narrative is barren and unsatisfactory. It may therefore
be inferred that the original compiler did not survive the death of
Henry the Sixth, and that the continuation was by another person. With
the events of that period the writer is consequently to be deemed
contemporary; and all which he relates of the reigns of Henry the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth, are peculiarly deserving of notice; for some
curious facts are mentioned, many of which have never, it is
believed, been so fully detailed, even if they were previously known;
whilst of earlier times his statements are as worthy of credit as
those of other Chroniclers who did not live in the ages of which they
respectively treat.

This volume is called "A CHRONICLE OF LONDON" in the title-page, from
the author having so particularly confined himself to the Metropolis;
and still more, because he has, like his successor Fabian, commenced
each year with the election of the Lord Mayors and Sheriffs of London,
whose names are uniformly recorded, but unfortunately no clue exists
by which the name of the writer can be ascertained.

To the history of England however, no less than to that of London,
this Chronicle will, it is confidently expected, be considered a
valuable addition; and the laudable avidity evinced by the
Corporation, under whose patronage it appears, as well as by numerous
natives of the metropolis, to possess every work relating to its early
history, justifies the hope that by them at least it will be
favourably received.

Towards the end of the volume the following ILLUSTRATIONS are
introduced, the most important of which have, with the obliging
permission of Henry Woodthorpe, Esq. the Town Clerk, been copied from
the invaluable muniments in the City Archives.

     A curious Latin Poem on the dispute between King Edward the
     First and the King of France, relative to some lands in
     Gascony in 1295. From the MS. in the Town Clerk's Office,
     marked Liber Custumarium.

     Sir Thomas Turbeville, in 1296. From the Cottonian MS.
     Caligula A. XVIII.

     Wales, giving an account of the Battle of Scluyse, dated

     Clerk's Office, marked Letter _F_.

     A Letter from Edward the Black Prince to the Mayor,
     Aldermen, and Commonalty of London, dated 22nd of October
     1356, detailing the proceedings of the English Army under
     his command, and informing them of the BATTLE OF POICTIERS.
     From the MS. in the Town Clerk's Office, marked Letter _G_.

     A Letter from a Priest, named Robert Prite, to some
     Nobleman, dated 8th of December 1356; in which he speaks of
     the Battle of Poictiers, and relates other news of the
     times. From the original in the Cottonian MS. Caligula D.
     III.

     A Declaration of Bernard Du Troy, a Gascon gentleman, made
     on his death-bed, 1st of July 1361, that he was the
     individual who took John King of France prisoner at the
     Battle of Poictiers. Also from the Cotton MS. Caligula D.
     III.

     A Proclamation of Richard II., dated at Chelmsford on the
     5th of July 1381, to the Earl of Warwick and others, denying
     that Wat Tyler and his followers were supported by his
     authority; and commanding them to use all possible means for
     the preservation of the peace in Warwickshire, and the
     places under their jurisdiction. Also from the Cottonian MS.
     Caligula D. III.

     A Poem, by Lydgate, describing the Expedition of Henry the
     Fifth into France, the Battle of Agincourt, and the
     magnificent Pageant prepared by the City of London, in
     honour of his return to the Metropolis. From the Harleian
     MS. 565.

     Another Poem, by Lydgate, describing the Pageant and
     Reception of Henry the Sixth into London on the 21st of
     February 1431, after his coronation as King of France. Also
     from the Harleian MS. 565.

     Two copies of a Poem on the reconciliation of the Lords of
     the Yorkist faction with King Henry the Sixth and his
     adherents; the one from the Cottonian MS. Nero A. VI., and
     the other from the Cottonian MS. Vespasianus B. XVI.

     A Ballad sent by a Pursuivant to the Sheriffs of London and
     their Brethren on May Day at Bishop's Wood, at an honorable
     dinner; each of them bringing his dish: by John Lydgate.
     From Ashmole's MS. No. 6943.

     Two copies of a Ballad, also by Lydgate, entitled "London
     Lickpenny;" the one from the Harleian MS. 542, and the other
     from the Harleian MS. 367.

     A short Ballad, also by Lydgate, upon the Emptiness of his
     Purse. From the Harleian MS. 2255.

     Another Ballad, by Lydgate, in ridicule of the Forked
     Head-dresses of Females. From the Harleian MS. 2255.

     A Ballad on Fraudulent Millers and Bakers; likewise by
     Lydgate. From the same MS.

The whole of these articles were written at the periods to which they
relate, and the greater part of them are for the first time printed;
whilst the few that have been before published, are inserted either
because more correct copies have been discovered, or because they are
so intimately connected with some of the others that they could not
with propriety be omitted.

Most of the pieces enumerated have escaped the notice of Historians;
and as they tend in an important degree to illustrate the Manners and
Customs of the Metropolis, their appearance in this volume cannot
fail, it is hoped, to be acceptable to those who are interested in the
early History of London or of this Kingdom.

In the Cottonian MS. is the following copy of the letter from queen

"Isabel, by the grace of God quene of England, ladie of Ireland and

"In this yere Edward Bailolle, the son of John Bailolle sometyme kyng
of Scotland, came into England chalengyng his right heritage, that is
to sey, the kingdome of Scotland; with whome many grete lordes of
England went into Scotland, and at Domfrevelyn arrividden, where fast
by an abbeie ij m^{l} of Englisshemen discomfited xij m^{l} of
Scottes." &c.


NOTE M. page 58.

In the copy in the Cottonian MS. this event is said to have occurred
in the _fifteenth_ year of Edw. III.--"Also this same yere, that is to
seye the xv yere of his reigne of England, was the first yere of his
reigne of France, and he came fro Tourney."

"This yere [A^{o}. xxxiiij. Edw. III.] the blode all fresshe flowid
out of the tombe of Thomas sometyme erle of Lancastre. Also this yere
the kyng chose his sepulture at Westmynstre. Also this yere, the yere
of oure lord m^{l} iij^{c} lx, the xiiij day of Aprile and the morn
after day, the kyng Edward with his hoste lay about Paris," &c. as is
related in the text to have occurred in the _thirty-fifth_ year of
Edward III., though the king's expedition to Calais against the regent
of France is stated to have occurred in the _thirty-fourth_ year.


NOTE M. page 67.

The sheriff called in the text Adam Wymondham, stands as Adam
Wymbyngham in the Cottonian MS.; and though the death of dame Blaunch
duchess of Lancaster is there mentioned, no notice occurs of the
pestilence.


NOTE N. page 70.

The following is the account of the events in this year [A^{o}. xlix.
Edw. III.], in the copy in the Cottonian MS.--"In this yere, at the
towne of Brugges in Flaundres, was tretid upon diverse articles
hangynge atwixt the pope and kyng Edward. Also the same tyme at
Brugges was tretid for a peas bitwixt the ij realmes Fraunce and
England. Also this yere deide William Witlesey archebisshop of
Caunterburye, and the monkes chose the cardinall of England; and the
kyng was wroth therwith, and wolde not consent therto, ne the pope nor
cardinall; and so Maister Symon succedid."


NOTE O. page 71.

The only event noticed in the copy in the Cottonian MS. in the 51st
Edw. III. is the death of Edward prince of Wales, and his burial at
Canterbury.


NOTE P. page 71.

It is singular that in both MSS. the events mentioned in the text, as
well as the death of Edward the Third, are said to have occurred in
the _fifty-second_ year of that monarch's reign, for he died in the
_fifty-first_ year, namely on the 21st of June 1377. The commencement
of his reign is always calculated from the 25th of January 1327, when
his father resigned the crown.

under this year, that "This yere, the yere of oure lord m^{l} iij^{c}

power."


NOTE R. page 79.

year in the Cottonian MS., than the following,

"In this yere was the good man at the litle Condit mordred."


NOTE S. page 80.

The occurrences mentioned in the text as having taken place in the
15th of Richard II. are in the Cottonian MS. assigned to the following
year; but no notice is taken under either year of "the pley of S^{t}.
Katerine."


NOTE T. page 80.

King Richard's expedition into Ireland in the 18th year of his reign,
is not noticed in the copy in the Cottonian MS.

The Cottonian MS. adds, that the earl of Arundel was beheaded at Tower

NOTE X. page 83.

Instead of the words "and of Braybroke &c." the following occur in the
copy in the Cottonian MS.

"and of the bisshop of London, Braybroke, putten a supplicacion to the

"To our full excellent right doutful sovereigne and ful graciouse lord

"And than after the presentacion of the seid supplicacion, there were
made many blank chartres; and alle the men of every crafte of the cite
as wele allowes and servaunts as the maisters, were charged to come to
the Yeldhalle, to set there sealis to the seid blank chartres." But
the disturbance "by Chestreschire men in Fryday strete," mentioned in
the text, is not noticed.

"And also Sir John Cornewaile, Sir Richard of Arundell, the son of Sir

NOTE BB. page 94.

The copy in the Cottonian MS. adds, "And about the fest of seint
Laurence the duke of Clarence seilid into Fraunce, to help the duke of
Orliaunce," but it takes no notice of the arrival of the prince and
his attendants in London, or of the departure of the duke of Clarence,
the duke of York, &c. to Southampton.


NOTE CC. page 96.

The mayor and sheriffs mentioned in the text and in the copy in the
Cottonian MS., as having served those offices in the 14th Hen. IV.,
are in the latter also assigned to the 1st Hen. V.; whilst the mayor
and sheriffs stated in the text to have served in the 1st Hen. V., are
in the latter attributed to the 2nd year of that monarch's reign. But
there is manifestly much confusion respecting the year of the king's
reign in which the events occurred, in the copy from which the text
has been taken, and which will again be alluded to in a future note.


NOTE DD. page 96.

The copy in the Cottonian MS. adds, "And were put in his owne
sepulture that he made himself, with quene Anne his wiffe." This is
the only circumstance mentioned under the 1st Hen. V. in that MS.: and
under the 2nd Hen. V., the transactions concerning Sir John Oldcastle
&c., which in the text are stated to have occurred in the preceding
year, are related.


NOTE EE. page 99.

In the Cottonian MS. under the _third_ year of Hen. V., and when the
mayor and sheriffs mentioned in the text as serving in the 2nd Hen. V.
are stated to have held those offices, the king's expedition is
properly noticed. This error cannot be explained in any other manner
than by attributing it to the transcriber; for it is notorious that
Henry quitted England, besieged and captured Harfleur, and fought the
battle of Agincourt, in the _third_ year of his reign. The account of
that expedition is so differently related from that in the text, that
it is here given at length.

"The kyng with alle his hoste seiled over the see with ij m^{l}
shippis and mo; and the xvj day of August a litle from Harflete he
landid: and the Saturday next after thassumpcion of oure lady he leide
siege about Harflete, and contynued the sege unto the Sonday next
before the fest of seint Michel, upon which Sonday the towne of
Harflete was delyvered to the king, that was the xxij day of
Septembre. But it is to wite, that on Tuesday bifore, that was the
xvij day of Septembre, at xij of the belle wythynne nyght, the lordes
that were capteynes and governours of the towne, that is to sey the
lord Gaucourt, the lord Tutvill, and mo other lordes, senten out an
haraude of armes unto the duke of Clarence, praiyng him at the
reverence of God that he wolde send to the kyng, bisechyng hym that he
wolde of his high and gracious lordship, graunt them leve to trete
with what persones that the kyng wolde assigne to them. And the kyng
at the reverence of God, and at there request, assigned therle of
Dorset, the lord Fitz Hugh, and S^{r}. Thomas of Erpyngham, to here
what thei wolde desire. And thei desired that the kyng wold not werre
upon them fro that houre at mydnyght, unto the Sonday next after the
fest of seint Michel; and but it were so that thei were rescued by
bataile of the Frensshe kyng or with the dolphyn by that day, thei to
yelde the towne to the kyng, and thei to have theire lives and goodes.
And the kyng sent them worde that if thei wolde delyver the towne on
the morwe next after the houre of mydnyght aforseid, without any
condicion, he wolde accepte it, and in any other wise he bad them seke
no trete. And yet the Frensshe lordes praied oure lordes to biseke the
kyng at the reverence of God and of oure lady, that he wolde graunte
them that same Tuesday nyght, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
and the Sonday til an houre after none: and in that meane tyme the
lordes that were capitayns of the towne, to come to the kyng with xxij
knyghts and squyers with them, of the moost sufficient men withyn the
towne, and thei to be sworen openly afore alle the people upon Goddis
body. But it so were that the Frensshe kyng or the dolphyn rescued
them by that Sonday, by the houre of none or anon after none, thei to
delyver the towne to the kyng, and alle there bodies and goodes to
done with them whatsoever him list, without eny condicion, with that
the kyng wolde suffre them to send to the Frensshe kyng viij persones
out of the towne, lettyng him wite in what plite thei stond: and they
graunted them. And upon the Wednesday by the morowe these lordes comen
out of the towne, and xxij knyghts with them; and come the procession
solempnely and stately, with xxiiij copis of a sute before Goddis
body, with many worshipful lordes, knyghts, and squyers, and other
moch multitude of people fro the kings tent, as solempnely done and as
stately as any man saugh ever such a thing done bifore that time; but
the kyng was not there present. And the Frenssh lordes there made
there othes upon the holy sacrament. And the othes thus done, the
Frensshe lordes with theire felauship were brought to the kyngs tents,
and there thei eten in the kyngs halle: but in all this tyme thei sawe
not the kyng. And when thei had eten, they were departid and delyvered
to certen lordes for to in hostage unto the Sonday at the houre after
none, as it was accordid whan thei received. And at the houre on
Sonday after none, the kyng had a tent pight on an hille bifore the
towne, and there he sate in his estate roial, and al his lordis about
hym; and than came the Frensshe lordes with iij^{xx} and iiij with
them, of the moost sufficient men that were withynne the towne, and to
the kyng in his propre persone yelded up the keies of the towne, and
there bodies and goodes to the kyngs grace without eny condicion: and
this was done the xxij day of Septembre, the yere of oure lord m^{l}
iiij^{c} xv. And anon after that, the kyng ostered from thens xxj
daies thurgh the realme of Fraunce, fro Harflete toward Caleys; and
the Friday, that is to sey the day of the holy seints Crispyn and
Crispinian, alle the roial power of Fraunce, excepte the Frenssh kyng,
the dolphyn, the duke of Bourgoyne, and the duke of Barre were bifore
the kyng in his heigh weie, as he shulde passe to Caleis, faire
embatailed in iij batailes, to the nombre of lx m^{l} men of armes,
and the fairist armed men that eny man saugh ever in any place. And
the kyng seyng wele that thei wolde not suffre hym to passe withouten
bataile, seid to his title mayny, 'Sires and felawes, the yonder men
letten us of oure wey; and if thei wol com to us, let every man preve
hymself a good man this day, and avaunt banere in the best tyme of the
yere.' And he rode furth with his basnet upon his hedde, and all other
men of armes went upon theire fete a fast paas in holle arraie, an
Englisshe myle er thei assemblid. And thrugh the grace of God the kyng
made his heigh wey thrugh the thikkest prees of alle the bataile. And
there was slayne the duke of Launson, the duke of Braban, the duke of
Bare, vj erles, the constable of Fraunce, the seneschall of Henaude,
the maister Arblaster, and of other lordes grete plente. And there was
take the duke of Orliaunce, the duke of Burbon, the counte of
Richmond, the counte Ewe, the marschal Sir Bursequant, and many other
lordes and knyghts. And there were slayne of Frensshemen v m^{l}, and
of al estats of Englisshemen passid not xxviij persones. And of estats
of thenglisshe, the duke of Yorke, therle of Suffolke, ij knyghts, and

kyng with all his prisoners came to London in good prosparite. Also
this same yere bigan the general counsell at Custance."

The arrival of the emperor is differently noticed in the copy in the
Cottonian MS.

"This yere [A^{o}. iv. Hen. V.] the vij day of Maij came themperour of
Almayne, Segismundus, to London; and the fest of seint George was
deferrid til his comyng, and than solempnely holden at Wyndisore: and

the kynges doughter ledynge the lambe in at the castel gates. And all
these sotelties were served to the emperor and to the kyng, and no

erle of Warwik receyved the duke of Burgoyne and brought him to
Caleys, where he spake with the kyng of diverse matiers atwixt them
ij. And he toke his leve of the kyng: and the erle of Warwik brought
hym agayne to Grevenyng Water; at which tyme also the counte Charlis
brought our lordes to the same place, where either of these lordes

was brought into the parliament; where the Speker of the parliament,
in the name and for al the comons of England, spake to the kyngs
persone these wordes after folowyng."

The speech assigned to the Speaker is then given; after which it is
stated that on "The xxvj day of Novembre the kyng with his modir
remoeved from Westminster to Waltham, and a certen tyme there were
abidyng; and fro thens he remoevid to Hertford, where he helde his
Cristmas, and the kyng of Scotts with him." An account of the
proceedings in Parliament in this year, especially of the impeachment
of Sir John Mortymer, knight, and of the statutes enacted therein
then follows at some length, and is succeeded by a minute account of
the French towns and castles taken by the duke of Bedford, the earl of
Salisbury, Sir John Radcliff seneschal of Guyenne, and Sir John
Beauchamp. It is also noticed, that in that year "therle of the March
with many other lordes and great retinue went into Irland, and there
deide." After stating the loss of the Scots at the battle of Vermuil,
it is added, "Wherfore it may be seid of them the worde of olde tyme,

     'That in the croke of the mone came thei thiderwarde,
     And in the wilde wanyng went thei homewarde.'"

up and offred: and than was set upon a courser and so rood thrugh the
Chepe and London to Kenyngton. And the kyng held his see diverse daies
in the parliament." Then follows an account of the grants made by that
parliament to the king, and of some statutes enacted therein. The
success of the English army under the earl of Salisbury is related in
a most minute manner, and the agreement for the surrender of Mauns is
given at length: but nothing is stated of sufficient interest to
justify so long a note as a copy of the narrative and treaty in
question would require.

cum magna multitudine Troianorum per responsum dee Diane in insulam a
Gigantibus olim Albion vocatam et inhabitatam intravit et Gigantes
omnes destruxit. inter quos erat quidam fortissimus nomine Gogmagog et
terram illam nomine suo Britanniam vocauit. Deinde a Saxonibus sive ab
Anglis eam conquerentibus vocata est Anglia. Et idem Brutus primus Rex
Britonum construxit primam Britannie vrbem que nunc Londonia vocatur
in memoriam Troie prius destructe vocans eam trinouantum id est Troiam
nouam que per tempus longum Trinouans vocabatur. Regnante tunc Ely
sacerdote in Judea et archa testamenti a Philisteis capta fuit. Post
mortem Bruti regnarunt in Britannia lviij Reges. Deinde regnavit rex
Lud qui muros vrbis Trinouantum fortiter edificauit que per ipsum
Caerlud vocabatur. Anglice _Loudesdon'_ et innumeris turribus
circumcinxit quam pre omnibus Ciuitatibus regni amauit. Et ideo
precepit vt domos et edificia edificarent que aliarum vrbium edificiis
prepollerent. eo defuncto corpus eius in predicta vrbe iuxta Januam
quam ipsemet construxit et a nomine suo _Ludesgate_ vocata fuit
nobilissime reconditum est. Demum Anglici vocauerunt eam _Londene_.
Postmodum Normanni vocauerunt eam _Loundres_ que Latine dicitur
Londonia. Post mortem Lud regnauit Cassibellanus frater eius videlicet
anno. lviij^{o}. ante incarnacionem Christi. tempore cuius venit
Julius Cesar in Britanniam cum multitudine copiosa et bis deuictus et
fugatus et expulsus. Tercio per auxilium Androgei ducis Kanc'.

OF LANCASTER, IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL'S, LONDON.

The church of St. Paul, London, contains within its limits three acres
of land and a half; one rood and a half, and six perches covered. The
length of the same church contains dclxxxx feet. The breadth of the
same church contains cxxx feet. The height of the western dome
contains from the altar cij feet. The height of the dome of the new
building contains from the altar lxxxviij feet. The whole pile of the
church contains in height cl. feet with the cross. The height of the
stone fabric of the belfry of the same church contains, from the level
ground, cclx feet. The height of the wooden fabric of the same belfry
contains cclxxiiij feet. But altogether it does not exceed five
hundred and xx^{ty} feet. Also the ball of the same belfry is capable
of containing, if it were vacant, ten bushels of corn; the rotundity
of which contains xxxvj inches of diameter, which make three feet; the
surface of which, if it were perfectly round, ought to contain four
thousand lxviij inches, which make xxviij square feet, and the fourth
part of one square foot. The staff of the cross of the same belfry
contains in height xv feet. The cross beam of which contains six feet.
In which cross, in the year of our Lord one thousand cccxxxix, on the
xi^{th} of the kalends of August, namely on the feast of saint Mary
Magdalene, many precious reliques of several saints were deposited
with great solemnity of procession, for the preservation of the same
cross and the whole building beneath them; that the Almighty God,
through the glorious merits of all the saints whose reliques are
contained in that cross, might deign to preserve them from tempest and
peril under his protection. Of whose mercy to all the xxvij procuring
succour to the fabric of this church, cl days are set apart at every
time of the year, besides the Roman ordinances which are xliiij^{or}
in the year, and very many other benefits.

quadrangular stones, to the bigness of eggs descended from the sky

[Sidenote: The ages of the world.]

In the beginning God created the heaven and earth and all things which
are in them. But on the sixth day from the creation of the world, was
[Sidenote: 1.]
made the first-formed Adam. The first age of the world, from Adam to
Noeh according to the Hebrews, contains a thousand, six hundred and
fifty six years; according to the Seventy Interpreters, two thousand
two hundred xliiij years. But according to Jerome not completely two
thousand; according to Metodus two thousand. The cause of which
diversity is, that these do not compute according to the manner of
sacred Scripture the minutiae of times, or of years, which are over and
above the thousands and hundreds of years. From the beginning of the
world until Noeh's flood, are two thousand two hundred fifty six
[Sidenote: 2.]
years. The second age from Noeh until Abraham, contains according to
the Seventy Interpreters, a thousand and seventy two years: according
[Sidenote: 3.]
to the Hebrews, a thousand two hundred and twenty two years. The third
age from Abraham until David, contains according to the Hebrews, eight
hundred and xl two years; but according to the Seventy Interpreters
[Sidenote: 4.]
much less, since they are deficient by two years. The fourth age from
David until the carrying away captive into Babylon, contains according
to the Hebrews, four hundred and seventy three years; according to the
Seventy Interpreters little less, for they are deficient in one year.
[Sidenote: 5.]
The fifth age, from the carrying away captive into Babylon, until
Christ, contains five hundred and eighty five years. According to
[Sidenote: 6.]
others, five hundred and ninety years. The sixth age is from Christ
until the end of the world. The years from the beginning of the world
until the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, are five thousand
ninety nine. The years from the incarnation of the same until his
passion, thirty three incomplete. The years from the creation of the
world until the destruction of Troy, iiij m^{l} xxx years. From the
destruction of Troy until the erection of new Troy, which is now
called London, lxiiij years. From the erection of new Troy to the
erection of the Roman city, ccclxxxx years. From the building of the
city until the coming of Christ, dcc.xv years. From the beginning of
the world iiij m^{l} lxxxxiiij years, after the destruction of Troy,
namely, in the mc and fifth year before the incarnation of Christ;
Brutus, a certain noble person sprung of the Trojan race, with a great
multitude of Trojans, through the response of the goddess Diana,
entered into the island formerly called Albion and inhabited by
giants; and destroyed all the giants, amongst whom was one very
mighty, by name Gogmagog; and he called that land after his own name
Britain. Afterwards by the Saxons or Angles that conquered it, it was
called England. And the same Brutus the first king of the Britons
constructed the first city of Britain, which is now called London, in
remembrance of the Troy before destroyed, calling it Trinovantum, that
is new Troy, which for a long time was called Trinovans. Ely the
priest was then reigning in Judea, and the ark of the testimony
captured by the Philistines. After the death of Brutus there reigned
in Britain lviij kings. Afterwards reigned king Lud, who strongly
built the walls of the city of the Trinovantes, which was by him
called Caerlud, in English LOUDESDON, and surrounded it with
innumerable towers; which he loved above all the cities of the realm,
and therefore directed that they should build houses and edifices,
which should surpass the buildings of other cities. At his death his
corpse was most nobly laid up in the aforesaid city near the gate
which he himself built, and was called from his name LUDESGATE. At
length the English called it LONDENE: afterwards the Normans called it
LOUNDRES which in Latin is called Londonia. After the death of Lud
reigned Cassibellanus his brother, namely, in the lviij^{th} year
before Christ's incarnation; in whose time came Julius Cesar into
Britain with a copious multitude, and being twice overcome and routed
and driven off, the third time being recalled into Britain, he, by the
aid of Androgeus duke of Kent, made it tributary to the Roman power.

VERSES.

"Whosoever thou art: if thou wishest to know the English kings or
laws, thou wilt read by perusing these. I will record the greater or
nobler kings; when they reigned, and where the people buried them.
Four thousand and a score years was Adam made before Brutus."

Brutus in the xv^{th} year of his age departing from Italy, arriving
at the island Leogecia in his ship, consulted there Diana, saying:

THE WORDS OF BRUTUS: VERSES.

"O mighty Goddess of the woods, terror of the wild boars, who hast
power to pass through ethereal space and the infernal abodes: unfold
earthly fate; and say what lands thou wishest us to inhabit; Tell also
the dwelling in which I shall venerate thee for ever; in which I shall
consecrate temples to thee with virgin dances."

THE REPLY OF DIANA.

"Brutus, under the setting sun, beyond the Gallic realms, there is an
island in the ocean all inclosed by sea; there is an island in the
ocean, once inhabited by giants, now indeed desert, fit for thy
tribes. This seek, for it shall be to thee a perpetual abode; Hence
shall arise another Troy to thy sons; Here from thine offspring shall
Kings be born, and to them shall all the earth be subject."

Brutus, comforted with such a reply, and having prepared a fleet,
steered with his people into the Island Albion which is now called
England, and began to reign therein, in the xxxv^{th} year of his age;
who in the xxiiij^{th} of his reign is buried at London. In the year

In the 36th page of the preceding Chronicle it is stated that "In this
yere (1295) the kyng [Edward the first] was defraunded of his lond in
Gascoigne in this manner, sothly: the kyng hadde yoven the forseyd
lond of Gascoyne to the kynges suster of Fraunce, for that she schulde
be yoyned to hym in fre mariage: and be some of his counseill enfeffed
here in the sayd lond of Gascoigne, whiche lond of Gascoigne sche yaf
to Charles here brother, and to other; and the matrymoigne betwen here
and kyng Edward sche sette at noughte, and wolde noughte stonden
therto."--That circumstance is the subject of the following Fragment
of a curious Poem preserved in the archives of the Corporation of the
City of London, in the MS. entitled _Liber Custumarium_, fol. 84; from
which it has been extracted by the obliging permission of Henry
Woodthorpe, Esq. the Town Clerk. The leaf which contained the
concluding stanzas has been lost; but judging from the number of those
which remain, it originally consisted of about nine more verses. It is
written in the hand of the period in which the events to which it
alludes took place, and as the documents in the volume from which it
is copied end in the succeeding reign, there is every reason to
presume that it was entered in the Records of the City of London
within a short period after it was composed. Every line of each verse
contains the same letter in the middle of the line, and every line
ends with the same letter: these two letters are placed in the middle
and at the end of each verse, separated from the words to which they
belong, but connected with them by lines in the manner in which the
first verse of the Poem is here printed, and which has been considered
sufficient to show the singular manner in which it was originally
written.

Turbevyle for treson was drawen and hanged."

Of the conduct which caused Sir Thomas Turbeville's execution, the
following fragment of a curious contemporary poem in the Cottonian MS.
_Caligula_ A. xviij, presents perhaps the most accurate information
which is extant. It immediately precedes, and is written in the same
hand as, the only _contemporary_ copy of the Roll of Carlaverock which
is known to exist, and hence it is highly probable that it was
composed by the same person. Under any circumstances, however, it
cannot fail to be deemed to possess sufficient interest to render it a
valuable illustration to the passage in the text.

the Frensshmen at Scluse, where there were sclayn of Frensshmen xxx
m^{l}; and the kyng toke and scomfyted at the sayd bataill of Scluse
cccx schippes." Of this passage, the following letter from king Edward
the Third to Edward the Black Prince, giving an account of his victory
over the French fleet at Sclyse, on Saturday the 24th of June
1340,--which, with the permission of Henry Woodthorpe, Esq., the Town
Clerk, has also been extracted from the City Archives, letter F. fol.
39,--is an interesting illustration. This document, which has escaped
the attention of Historians, presents an authentic detail of that
memorable event; and it is evident from it that Robert de Avesbury,
the contemporary writer upon whom the greatest reliance has hitherto
been placed, has fallen into some errors in his narrative of the
transaction. He informs us that on the day after the battle a rumour
of it reached London, but that it was discredited until the ensuing
Wednesday, namely the 28th of June, when the Prince of Wales received
a letter from the king informing him of his success, of which letter
that writer asserts that the annexed was a copy:

"Edwardus Dei Gracia Rex Angliae et Franciae et Dominus Hiberniae, &c.
Effusam circa nos hiis diebus propiciacionis divinae clemenciam, ad
vestri contemplacionem et laeticiam, vobis ducimus intimandam. Scitis
autem, immo vos et alios[136] fideles nostri quadam participacione
sensitis, quantis fuimus et sumus guerrarum lacessiti turbinibus, et
velut in mari magno procellosis fluctibus agitati. Sed licet sint
mirabiles elaciones maris, mirabilior tamen in altis Dominus, qui
procellam convertens in auram, jam inter tot adversa clementissime nos
respexit. Nam cum pridem ordinassemus passagium nostrum necessarium
versus partes Flandriae, Dominus Philippus de Valesio, persecutor
noster infestissimus, hoc praevidens, classem maximam navium armatarum
quam in expugnacionem nostram nostrorumque fidelium misit, ut vel sic
nos caperet, vel nostrum transitum impediret. qui transitus si, quod
absit, fuisset impeditus, ardua negocia, quae prosequimur, fuissent
penitus in ruina: quinimmo nos et nostri fuissemus verisimiliter
confusionis[137] magnae subjecti. Sed Deus misericordiarum, videns nos
in tantis periculis constitutos, graciosius et cicius, quam humana
racio judicare poterat, misit nobis magnum navale subsidium, et
insperatum numerum armatorum, ac semper ventum prosperum juxta votum,
et sic, sub spe coelestis auxilii, et justiciae nostrae fiducia,
dictum portum navigio venientes, invenimus dictam classem et hostes
nostros ibidem paratissimos ad praelium in multitudine copiosa; quibus,
in festo Nativitatis Sancti Johannis Baptistae proximo praeterito, ipse
spes nostra Christus deus per conflictum fortem et validum nos
praevalere concessit, facta strage non modica dictorum hostium, capta
eciam quodammodo tota dicta classe, cum laesione gentis nostrae modica
respective, sicque tucior de cetero patebit transitus nostris
fidelibus supra mare, et alia bona plurima sunt ex hoc nobis et
nostris fidelibus verisimiliter proventura, de quo spes pulcherima jam
arridet. Nos autem, tantam coelestem graciam devotissime
contemplantes, ipsi Salvatori nostro laudes et gracias humiliter
exsolvimus, deprecantes, ut, qui jam et semper in oportunitatibus
copiosis graciis[138] nos praevenit continuatis, nos auxiliis
prosequatur, et nobis regere temporaliter sic concedat in terris, ut
in eo laetemur aeternaliter in excelsis. Dileccionem vestram attente
rogamus et per Dei misericordiam obsecramus, quatinus soli Deo vivo,
qui tantum signum nobiscum fecit in bonum, in devotae laudis praeconium
assurgentes, nos, jam in remotis agentes, et nedum jura nostra
recuperare, sed sanctam ecclesiam catholicam attollere, et in justicia
populum regere cupientes, sibi devotis oracionum instanciis
recomendare curetis, facientes pro nobis missas, et alia piae
placacionis officia misericorditer exerceri, et ad hoc clerum et
populum vestrae diocesis salutaribus monitis inducatis, ut Deus ipse,
miseratus nobis, progressum felicem et exitum annuat graciosum, detque
servo suo cor docile, ut recte judicare possimus et regere et sic
facere quod praecipit, ut mereamur assequi quod promittit. Teste

It is however manifest from that document having been tested by the
Prince of Wales, that it was rather a proclamation issued in
consequence of the dispatch from the king to the prince, than the
dispatch itself, of which the letter now for the first time printed
may be deemed the only copy which is extant. Nor must it be forgotten
that the date affixed to the article given by Avesbury tends to excite
a suspicion of its authenticity; for it is tested by the prince at
Waltham Holy Cross upon the precise day, the 28th of June, on which
the king's letter was written, and which could not therefore possibly
have arrived on the day in question at Waltham. It is somewhat
singular that as the battle was concluded on the 25th of June, the
king should not have written until the 28th; but this may perhaps be
accounted for by those arrangements which his success would
necessarily have required, and which may be supposed to have engaged
the monarch's whole attention for some days. The letter in Avesbury's
Annals gives no particulars of the battle, though that writer relates
that the enemy were beaten; that more than thirty thousand of them
were slain; that many leapt into the sea from fear and were drowned;
and that their fleet consisted of two hundred large ships, on board of
one of which four hundred dead bodies were found. The Royal dispatch,
however, affords much more minute information, and corrects the
statements both in Avesbury and in the preceding Chronicle. It asserts
that the French fleet amounted to one hundred and eighty sail; that
they were nobly defended the whole of a day and a night; that they
were all captured in the engagement excepting twenty-four which took
to flight, and part of them were subsequently taken at sea; that the
number of the men at arms and other armed persons amounted to
thirty-five thousand, of whom five thousand escaped; that the English
ships captured by the French at Middleburgh were then retaken; and
that among the prizes were three or four as large as 'the
Christopher,' which we may infer was then the largest ship of the
English navy.

It is unquestionable from what has been said, that this document
supplies some important facts in the history of the times, whilst its
entry among the Records of the City of London tends to establish that
the Mayor of the city was accustomed at that early period to receive
an official account of every public transaction, and of which another
example will be found in a subsequent page.

The events which led to the battle of the Swyne, or as it is more
generally termed of the Scluse, are too familiar to require
repetition.

It would be difficult to name a more interesting document connected
with English History than that by which, through the courtesy of Henry
Woodthorpe, Esq., Town Clerk of the City of London, the passage in the
text will be illustrated; namely, a copy of the letter from Edward the
Black Prince to the Mayor, Aldermen and Comonalty of London,
acquainting them with the achievement of the battle of Poictiers. This
important record, which has never before been printed, occurs among
the archives of the city, in a contemporary MS. entitled Letter G.
fol. 53^{b}. and was, there can be little doubt, entered into that
volume soon after the receipt of the original.

The greater part of the Prince's letter is occupied by the detail of
the proceedings of the army for some days previous to the battle, and
in describing the efforts of the Cardinal Peregort to produce a peace
or truce between the kings of France and England; whilst the conflict
itself is mentioned in a few words. Independently of the particulars
of the English forces and their rencontres with the enemy which this
letter so minutely relates, its most important statement is that of
the precise day when the battle took place, for historians have
differed materially upon the point. The Prince, however, expressly
says that it occurred on the eve of the feast of St. Matthew, i.e. the
20th of September. His letter was dated at Bordeaux on the 22nd of the
following month, and was sent to the Mayor of London by the Prince's
chamberlain Sir Neel Loring; and the manner in which he refers the
Mayor and Citizens to that distinguished knight for further
information, cannot fail to be noticed, from its great similarity to
the conclusion of a modern military dispatch. Another feature of this
and other documents of the same nature in early periods, is the great
simplicity and modesty with which they are written. An expression of
gratitude to God alone interrupts the unadorned narrative; and the
defeat of an army infinitely superior in numbers, and the capture of
one of the most powerful sovereigns of the times together with his
eldest son, are thus laconically related: "The battle took place on
the eve of St. Matthew; and, praise be to God, the enemy were
discomfited, and the king and his son were taken, and great numbers of
other people taken and slain." To present as many contemporary
documents as could be collected relative to this memorable event, two
other letters are introduced, as well as the affidavit of an
individual who claimed to have been the person to whom king John of
France surrendered himself.

One of the letters alluded to, which is printed in the _Archaeologia_,
vol. i. p. 213, is also from the Black Prince, to Reginald Bryan
bishop of Worcester, dated at Bordeaux on the 20th of November,
briefly informing him of his success, which he attributes in a great
measure to the efficacy of that prelate's prayers.

The other letter is from Robert Prite to some English nobleman, dated
on the 8th of December 1356, whose clerk, or probably priest, he
styles himself, and is taken from the original on vellum in the
Cottonian MS. Caligula D. III. f. 33. After mentioning the battle of
Poictiers, the particulars of which he says he will learn from a
knight whom the duke of Lancaster had sent into England to the king,
the writer acquaints him with some other news of the time, as well as
with what had occurred in some of his towns; and entreats him to come
over as soon as possible. This letter, which is now for the first time
printed, though not so important as the others, is nevertheless of
interest, as connected with the battle of Poictiers, and with other
public and private transactions of the period.

The third document on the subject is the solemn declaration of Bernard
du Troy, a Gascon gentleman, made on his death-bed the 1st of July
1361, that he was the person who took the king of France prisoner at
the battle of Poictiers; which point it is evident from this
instrument, as well as from historians, had been much disputed. This
very curious article, which also occurs in the Cottonian MS. just
mentioned, is highly interesting; for it not only shows who were the
claimants to the honour of having captured the king, but the ardour
with which that claim was supported. It is however doubtful whether
the love of fame or pecuniary interest prompted this declaration at so
awful a moment; but his motive, like those of most other human
actions, was probably of a mixed nature; for whatever might be the
renown which was attached to the exploit, the ransom to which the true
claimant would be entitled must have been an object of great
consideration to him or to his heirs. Du Troy carefully provides, that
those who would support his pretensions with their swords should
partake of the benefits which might arise from their valour; and this
circumstance presents a curious picture of the manners of the age. Sir
Denys de Morbeque of whom he speaks, is thus noticed by Froissart.
"There was much pressing at this time through eagerness of taking the
king: and those that were nearest to him, and knew him, cried out
'Surrender yourself, surrender yourself, or you are a dead man.' In
that part of the field was a young knight from St. Omer, who was
engaged by a salary in the service of the king of England: his name
was Denis de Morbeque, who for five years had attached himself to the
English, on account of having been banished in his younger days from
France for a murder committed in an affray at St. Omer. It
fortunately happened for this knight, that he was at the time near to
the king of France when he was so much pulled about. He by dint of
force, for he was very strong and robust, pushed through the crowd and
said to the king in good French, 'Sire, sire, surrender yourself.' The
king, who found himself very disagreeably situated, turning to him,
asked 'To whom shall I surrender myself; to whom? Where is my cousin
the Prince of Wales? if I could see him I would speak to him.' 'Sire,'
replied Sir Denys, 'he is not here; but surrender yourself to me, and
I will lead you to him.' 'Who are you?' said the king. 'Sire, I am
Denys de Morbeque, a knight from Artois, but I serve the king of
England because I cannot belong to France, having forfeited all I
possessed there.' The king then gave him his right-hand glove, and
said 'I surrender myself to you.' There was much crowding and pushing
about, for every one was eager to cry out 'I have taken him.'"

Most of the witnesses to Du Troy's declaration were celebrated peers
and knights both of England and France.

erchebisshop of Caunterbury and chaunceler of Englond; and frere
Robert Hales priour of seynt Jones house, than tresorer of Engelond,"
&c.

The rebellion noticed in the text is so important an event in the
history of England as well as of the Metropolis, that no apology can
be required for the insertion of an inedited document in any degree
connected with it. In the _Foedera_, tom. vii. are several
proclamations on the same subject, and among them one tested at London
on the 15^{th} June 1381, directed to the sheriff of Kent; but the
following, dated at Chelmsford on the 5^{th} of July in that year, has
never, it is believed, been printed. It appears from it that the
rebels had asserted that they were supported by the king's authority;
and His Majesty therefore, not merely denies the fact, but commands
the earl of Warwick and the other persons in that county to whom the
instrument is addressed, to use every possible effort to suppress the
disturbance of the public peace, in places under their jurisdiction.

In pp. 99-102, as well as in pp. 157-159, an account is given of Henry
the Fifth's expedition into France in the year 1415, and of the battle
of Agincourt. In the Harleian MS. N^{o} 565, from which the preceding
Chronicle was transcribed, the following Poem occurs on the same
subject, a correct copy of which has never been published, though at
the end of Hearne's edition of Elmham's Life of Henry the Fifth, a
poem is inserted so very similar to the annexed that it may be
presumed to have been taken from another copy of the same. It is said
to have been transcribed from the Cottonian MS. Vitellius D. XII.,
which is not now extant: but upon collating this piece with the one
printed by Hearne, it appears, after allowing for the various readings
which frequently occur in different copies of an early poem, that many
words were erroneously given by that zealous antiquary.
Notwithstanding that it possesses but little claim to poetical merit,
it is highly curious, from its being nearly if not quite contemporary
with the events which it relates; for there can be no doubt of its
having been a production of the prolific pen of that "drivelling
monk," as he has been severely termed, the monk of Bury, John Lydgate,
several of whose other pieces, from their presenting a faithful but
rude picture of the manners and transactions of the times, are also
inserted in this volume. The garrulous monk, in the article which is
the subject of these remarks, particularly notices every circumstance
in which the Mayor and Citizens of the Metropolis were concerned, and
hence it is an appropriate illustration of a "CHRONICLE OF LONDON." It
is worthy of observation, that the story of the tennis-balls having
been sent as a satirical present from the Dauphin to Henry the Fifth,
and to which Shakspeare alludes, is frequently mentioned in the poem,
and furnishes the writer with several metaphors.

     "_Ambass._ He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
                This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
                Desires you, let the dukedoms that you claim,
                Hear no more of you--This the Dauphin speaks.

     _K. Hen._  What treasure, uncle?

     _Exeter._  Tennis-balls, my liege.

     _K. Hen._  We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
                His present, and your pains, we thank you for:
                When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
                We will in France, by God's grace, play a set,
                Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard:
                Tell him, he hath made a match with such a wrangler,
                That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
                With chaces....

                And tell the pleasant prince,--this mock of his
                Hath turn'd his balls to gun stones;[145] and his soul
                Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
                That shall fly with them:"

     _Henry the Fifth_, Act I. Scene II.

[Footnote 145: Thus Lydgate, _infra_,

     "For they shall play with Harflete,
     A game at tynes, as y wene,
     Mine engynes that bethe so kene
     They shall be sett besyde this hill,
     Over all Harflew that they may sene
     For to loke if they play well;
     Go we to game be Godys grace,
     Myne children ben redy everych on
     Every greet gonne that there was,
     In his mouth he hadde a ston."

But Shakspeare's expressions are still more similar to those of an
inedited Chronicler of the period: "And whan the kyng had hard ther
wordis and the answere of the dolphynne, he was wondre sore agreved
and right evell assayd towarde the Frensshmen, and toward the kyng and
the Dolphynne, and thought to avenge hym upon them as sone as Good
wold send hym grace and myght, and anon lette make tenys ballis for
the Dolpynne in all the hast that they myght be made; _and they were
grete gonne stones for the Dolpynne to play wythall_." _Cottonian
MSS._ _Claudius_ A. viii.]

But besides the historical information with which the poem abounds,
and which is corroborated by the best authorities, it cannot fail to
be considered of much interest, from the description of the
magnificent reception of the king into London, after his return from
France.


A POEM BY JOHN LYDGATE, MONK OF BURY, DESCRIBING THE EXPEDITION OF
HENRY THE FIFTH INTO FRANCE IN 1415, THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT, AND THE
KING'S RECEPTION INTO LONDON ON HIS RETURN.

[_Harl. MSS._ 565.]

God that all this world gan make
And dyed for us on a tre,
Save Ingelond for Mary sake,
Sothfast God in Trinyte;
And kepe oure kyng that is so free,
That is gracious and good with all,
And graunt hym evermore the gree,
Curteys Crist oure kynge ryall.

Oure kyng sente into France ful rathe,
Hys bassatours bothe faire and free;
His owne right for to have,
That is, Gyan and Normande;
He bad delyvre that his schulde be,
All that oughte kyng Edward,
Or ellys tell hym certeynle,
He itt gette with dynt of swerd.
_Wot ye right well that thus it was,
Gloria tibi Trinitas._

And than answerde the dolfyn bold
To oure bassatours sone ageyn,
Me thinke youre kyng he is nought old,
No werrys for to maynteyn;
Grete well youre kyng, he seyde, so yonge
That is bothe gentill and small;
A tonne of tenys ballys I shall hym sende,
For to pleye hym with all.
_Wot ye right well, &c._

A dien Sire, seide oure lordis alle,
For there they wolde no longer lende:
They token there leve, bothe grete and smalle,
And hom to Ingelond they gum wende;
And thanne they sette the tale on ende,
All that the Dolfyn to them gon say;
I schal hym thanke thanne, seyde our kynge,
Be the grace of God if that y may.
_Wot ye right well, &c._

The kyng of Fraunce that is so old,
Onto oure kyng he sente on hy,
And prayde trews that he wolde hold
For the love of seynt Mary.
Oure Cherlys of Fraunce gret well, or ye wende,
The Dolfyn prowed withinne his wall,
Swyche tenys ballys I schal hym sende
As schall tere the roof all of his all.

To geten agen that scholde ben his;

Be right of eritage he scholde it have,
Therof he seith he wyll nought mys,

Sires, he seyde, be swete seynt John;
Of good counsaill y will yow pray,

With gladder will than we kon say.

Over the see y thenke to passe:

Hyse gret gonnys and engynes stronge,
At London he schipped them alle in fere,
And sone fro Westmenster then sprongye,
With alle hyse lordys, sothe to saye:

And thorugh out London thanne gan he ryde;

And fro thens to Suhthampton, unto that strond,
For sothe he wold no longer there dwell:

With riche sayles and heye topcastell.
Lordys of this lond, oure kyng gan there sell,
For a milion of gold as y herd say,
Therfore there truayle was quyte them full well,
For they wolde a mad a queynte aray.

At the pyle of Ketecaus, the sothe y yow say,
On oure lady even, the assumpcion, the thirdde yer of hys rayn,
And boldely hys baner there he gan display.

And mustred his meyne faire before the town,
And many other lordys I dar well say,
With baners brighte and many penoun:
And there they pyght there tentys a down,
That were embroudyd with armys gay;

And all othere lordes in good aray.

A game at tynes as y wene.

Over all Harflewe that they may sene,

To wyte what was his wille to don
That he was come with his navy;
Delivere me this toune, oure kyng gan say;

Or he have yolde this toun Harflete.

With his breth he dide down blowe.

Let us gon to ben on assent;
Wherevere that the ball gan glyde,
The houses of Harflew they all to rent.
An Englyssh man the bulwerk brent,
Women cryed alas! that they were bore,
The Frensshmen seide now be we shent,
From us this toun now it is lore.
_Wot ye right well, &c._

It is best now that we therfore,

For to dystroye us in this place;
For but the Dolfyn us reskewe,

But he was goon, durst he nought abyde.

And thanne to Westminster he wente withoute dwellyng.
In xv wokes forsothe, he wroughte al this,
Conquered Harfleu and Agincourt;

The following poem by Lydgate presents a very minute account of the
manner in which the young monarch was received into London after his
coronation as king of France, and of the pageant upon the occasion.
Two copies exist in MS. in the British Museum; one in the Harleian MS.
565, which has been literally transcribed; the other in the Cottonian
MS. Julius B. II; and the variations between them will be found in the
notes. About one third of this article, taken from the former of those
MSS., is printed in Malcolm's London, vol. ii. p. 89, but it conveys a
very imperfect idea of the whole composition; for not only has the
orthography of the extract been modernized, but the most interesting
descriptions do not occur. The annexed is therefore, it is presumed,
the only correct copy which has ever been published, and it cannot
fail to be deemed an exceedingly curious illustration of the passage
in "The Chronicle," as well as of the manners of the period. Lydgate
does not mention upon what day of the month the circumstance took
place, but says that it was "upon a Thorsday" "toward the ende of
wyndy Februarie:" and as the 21st of February in 1431 fell on a
Thursday, there is little doubt that it was on that day that Henry
entered London.

Upon London, to make them glad and light.

In alle the hevenes there was no clowde sayne;
From other daies that day was so devydyd,
And fraunchisyd from mystys and from rayn;
The erthe[152] attempred, the wyndes smothe and playne,
The Citezeines thorugh out the Citee,
Halwyd that day with gret solempnyte.

[Footnote 152: eyre.]

And lyk for David after his victorie,
Rejoysyd was al Jerusalem,
So this Cite with laude, pris, and glorie,
For joye mustred lik the sonne bem,
To geve ensample thorugh out this Reem;
Al of assent who so can conceyve,
There noble kyng were glad to resceyve.

There clothyng was of colour ful covenable;
The noble Mair clad in red velwet,
The Shireves, the Aldermen, ful notable,
In furryd clokes, the colour of scarlet;
In statly wyse whanne they were met,
Ich on were wel horsyd, and mad no delay,[153]
But with there Maire rood forth in there way.

[Footnote 153: Eche oon well horsed made no delay.]

The Citezeyns ich on of the Citee,
In there entent that they were pure and clene;
Ches them of whit a ful faire lyvere,
In evry craft as it was wel sene;
To shewe the trowthe that they dede mene,
Toward the kyng hadde mad them feithfully,
In sundry devyses embrowdyd richely.

And for to remembre of other alyens,
First Geneweys, thorugh thei were strangers,
Florantynys, and Venyciens,
And Esterlyngs, clad[154] in there manere,
Conveyd with seriaunts and othere officers,
Statly horsyd, after the Mair ridyng,
Passyd the subbarbes to mete with the kyng.

[Footnote 154: gladde.]

To the Blake heth whanne they dyd atteyne,
The Mair of prudence in especialle,
Made them hove in renges tweyne,
A strete betwen ech party lik a walle,
Alle clad in whit, and the most principalle,
A fore in red, with the[155] Mair rydyng,
Til tyme that he saw the kyng comyng;

[Footnote 155: theire.]

Thanne with his sporys, he tok his hors anone,
That to beholde it was a noble sight,
How lyk a man he to the kyng is gone,
Right well cheryd of herte, glad, and light;
Obeienge to hym, as hym ought of right:
And after that he cunningly abraid,
And to the kyng even thus he sayd;

"Sovereigne lord and noble kyng, ye be wolcome out of youre rem of
Fraunce, into this youre blessyd rem of Ingelond, and in especial unto
youre most notable Citee of London, otherwise callyd youre chambre, we
thankynge Almyghty[156] God of the good and gracious athenyng of youre
crowne of Fraunce, besechynge of his mercyful grace to sende yow
prosperite and many yeris, to the comfort of alle your lovyng pepill."

[Footnote 156: _Omitted._]

But for to tellen alle the circumstauncys,
Of every thyng shewed in centencs,
Noble devyses, diverse ordinauncys,
Conveid be scripture with ful gret excellence;
Al to declare, y have non eloquence,
Therfore y pray to alle tho that it schal rede,[157]
For to correcte where as they se nede.

[Footnote 157: that shall yt rede.]

First, whan they[158] passyd was the fabour,
Entring the brigge of this noble town,[159]
There was a peler reysyd lik a tour,
And theron stod a sturdy champyone,
Of look and chere, stern as a lyone;
His swerd uprered, prowdly gan manace,
Alle foreyn enemyes from the kyng to enchace;

[Footnote 158: he.]

[Footnote 159: citee.]

And in defens of his estat riall,
The geaunt wolde abyde ech aventure,
And alle assautes that were marcyall,
For his sake he proudly wolde endure;
In tokenynge wher of, he hadde a long[160] scripture,
On either syde declaryng his entent,
Whiche sayde thus, be good avisement.

[Footnote 160: _Omitted._]

[Sidenote: Inimicos ejus induam confusione.]

"Alle tho that ben enemys to the kyng,
I schal them clothe with confucione;
Make hym myghti be vertuos levyng,
His mortall fou to oppressen and bere a downe,
And hym to encresene as Cristes champione;
Alle myschevys from hym to abrigge,
With the grace of God, at the entryng of this[161] brigge."

[Footnote 161: the.]

Too antilopis stondyng on either syde,
With the armes of Ingelond and of Fraunce,
In token that God schall for hym provide,
As he hath title be juste eneritaunce,
To regne in pees, plente, and alle plesaunce;
Cesyng of werre, that men myghte ryden and[162] gone,
As trewe liegis, there hertys mad bothe oone.

[Footnote 162: or.]

Forthermore, so as the kyng gan ryde,
Middes of the brigge there was a toure on lofte;
The lord of lordes beynge ay his gyde,
As he hath be and yit wil be ful ofte.
The tour araied with velwetty softe,
Clothys of gold, silk, and tapicerie,
As apperteynyth to his regalye.

And at his comyng, of excellent beaute,
Benygne[163] of port, most womanly of chere,
There issued out, empresses thre;
There here displaied, as Phebus in his[164] spere,
With crownettys of gold and stones clere;
At whos out comyng thei gaf swyche a light,
That the beholders were stonyed in there sight.

[Footnote 163: beyng.]

[Footnote 164: her.]

[Sidenote: Nature.]

[Sidenote: Grace.]

The first of them was callyd[165] NATURE,
As sche that hath undyr here demayne,
Man, beest, and foul, and every creature,
Withinne the bondys of here goldyn cheyne;[166]
Eke hevene, and erthe, and every creature,[167]
This empresse of custum doth enbrace:
And next here com here suster callyd GRACE.

[Footnote 165: called was.]

[Footnote 166: _These lines are transposed._]

[Footnote 167: _These lines are transposed._]

Passyng famous, and of gret reverence,
Most desyryd in alle regions;
For where that evere shewith here presence,
She bryngeth gladnes to citees and to townys.
Of alle welle fare she halt[168] the possessionys,
For y dar sey, prosperite in no place,
No while abidith, but if there be grace.

[Footnote 168: holdeth.]

[Sidenote: Fortune.]

In tokene that Grace shal[169] longe continue,
Unto the kyng, she shewyd here ful benygne;
And next here com the empresse FORTUNE,
To hym aperyng with many a noble signe,
And riall tokenys, to shew that he was digne,
Of God disposyd as lust[170] ordeygne,
Upon his hed to were crownes tweyne.

[Footnote 169: shuld.]

[Footnote 170: lyst.]

[Sidenote: Natura Gracia et Fortuna.]

These thre ladies, al of on entent,
Thre goostly gyftes, hevynly, and devyne,
Unto the kyng anon they dyd present;
And to his hignesse they dyd anon enclyne,
And what they weren pleynly to determyne;
Grace gaf hym first at his comynge,
Two riche gyftes, sciens and cunnynge.

[Sidenote: Intende prospere procede et regna.]

Nature gaf hym eke strengthe, and fayrnesse,
For to be lovyd and dred of every wight;
Fortune gaf hym eke prosperite, and richesse;
With this scripture aperyng in ther sight,
To hym applied of verey due right,
"First undirstonde and wilfully procede,
And longe to regne," the scripture seide in dede.

This is to mene, who so undirstondith aright,
Thow shalt be fortune have long prosperite;
And be nature thow shalt have strengthe, and myght,
Forth to procede in long felicite;
And grace also hath grauntyd unto the,
Vertuously longe in thi roiall citee,
With septre and crowne to regne in equyte.

On the right hand of these Empresses,
Stode thir[171] maydenys verey celestialle;
Like Phebus bemys shone there golden tresses,
Upon there hedes ech havyng a crownalle,
Of port and chere semyng immortalle:
In sight transsendyng alle erthely creatures,
So angelik they weren of there figures.

[Footnote 171: sevyn.]

Al clad in white, in tokene of clennesse,
Liche pure virgynes as in there ententys,
Schewynge outward an hevenly fresshe brightnesse;
Stremyd with sonnys weren alle there garmentys,
Aforne provyded for pure innocentys:
Most colombyne of chere and of lokyng,
Meekly roos up at the comyng of the kyng.

They had on bawdrikes al on saphire hewe,
Goynge outward gan the kyng salue,
Hym presentyng with ther gyftes newe,
Lik as thei[172] thought it was to them due;
Whiche gostly giftes, here in ordre suwe,
Down descendyng as silver dewe from hevene,
Al grace includyd[173] withinne the giftes sewene.

[Footnote 172: them.]

[Footnote 173: include.]

These riall giftes ben of vertu most
Goostly corages, most soveraygnely delite,
The[174] giftes callyd of the Holy Goost,
Outward figuryd be seven dowys white;
Seyenge[175] to hym, lik as clerkes write,
"God the fulfille with intelligence
And with a spirit of goostly sapience

[Footnote 174: these.]

[Footnote 175: And seyyng.]

[Sidenote: Impleat te Deus sp'u sapiciencie et intellectus sp'u

God sende also to thi moost availe,
The to preserve from alle hevynesse;
A spirit of strenghthe, and of good counsaile,
Of cunnyng, drede, pite, and of lownesse:"
Thus thise ladies gan there gyftes dresse,
Graciously at there out comyng,
Be influence light upon the kyng.

These Empresses hadde on there left syde,
Othere vij virgines, pure and clene,
Be attendaunce continually to abyde,
Al clad in whit, smete ful of sterrers shene;
And to declare what they wolde mene,
Unto the kyng with fulle gret reverence,
These weren there gyftes shortly in sentence;

[Sidenote: Induat te Dominus corona glorie sceptro clemencie,[176]

And with a[178] septre of clennesse and pite;
And with a sheld of right,[179] and victorie;
And with a mantel of prudence clad thow be;
A sheld of feith for to defende the;
An helm of helthe wrought to thin encres;
Girt with a girdell of love and perfight pees.

These vij virgynes of sight most hevenly,
With herte, body, and handys reioysyng,
And of there[180] cheres aperid murely,
For the kynges gracious hom comyng;
And for gladnesse they began to synge,
Most angelik with hevenly armonye,
This same roundelle which y shal now specifie.

The temporary reconciliation between the adherents of the King and of
the Duke of York, so briefly alluded to in the text, and which is best
illustrated by the following extract from a contemporary letter,
served, like every other event of his times, for the exercise of
Lydgate's pen; but his description of it in the following ballad is
infinitely more valuable from its historical accuracy, than its
poetical merit. Of this article there are two copies extant; one in
the Cottonian MS. Nero A. VI. and the other in the Cottonian MS.
Vespasianus B. XVI.: the latter copy has been printed, though very
erroneously, and with the orthography modernized, by Mr. Sharon
Turner; but the former has not been before noticed. As they differ in
some places from each other, and are very short, it has been thought
advisable that both transcripts should be inserted.

UPON THE RECONCILIATION OF THE LORDS OF THE YORKIST FACTION WITH THE
KYNG AND HIS ADHERENTS.

[_Cottonian MS._ Nero A. VI.]

Whan Charyte ys chosen with stats to stonde,
Stedfast and styll, with oute distaunce,
Then wreth may be exilid out of thys londe,
And God oure gide to have governaunce;
Wysdom and welthe with all plesaunce,
May ryghtfulle reigne, and prosperite,
For love hath underleyde wrethfull vengeaunce;
Reioyse Enlond the lords acordid bee.

Reioyse, and thonke God, and sorw no more,
For now shal encrese thi consolacone;
Oure enemes quake for drede ful sore,
That pees ys made that was divisione,
Whiche ys to them grete confusione,
And to us joy and felicite;
God hold them longe in every seasone,
That Englond may reioyce, the concord and unite.

Now ys sorw with shame fled yn to Fraunce,
As a felon that hath forsworne thys lond;
Love hath put owte malicius governaunce,
In every place both fee and bonde;
In Yorke, in Somersett, as y undyrstonde,
In Warwikke also ys love and charite,
In Salisbury eke, and yn Northumberlond,
That every man may reioyce the concord and unite.

Egremond,[257] and Clyfford,[258] and other forseyd,
Ben sett yn the same opynyone;
In every quartre love is thus leide,
Grace and wisdome hath the dominacione;
Awoke welth, and welk in thys regione,
Rewnde abowte in towne and cite,
And thonke them that brought it to thys conclusion;
Reioyse Englond the concord and unite.

Northumberland. He was created Baron of Egremont 20th December 1449,
and died in 1460.]

1422, and died in 1454.]

At Poules in London, with grete renowne,
On oure Lady day the pes was wrought;
The kyng, the quene, with lords many one,
To worshyppe that virgine as they oght,
Went a prosession, and sparyd right noght,
In sight of alle the comonialte,
In tokyn that love was in hert and thoght;
Reioice Englond the concord and unite.

There was by twene them lovely countenaunce,
Whyche was grete yoy to alle that there were,
That long tyme hadd ben in variaunce,
As frynds for ever they went yn fere,
They went togedre, and made good chere;
O Fraunce and Bretayne, repent shall ye,
For the bergeyne shalle ye bye fulle dere;
Reioice Englond the concord and unite.

Our sovereyn lord the kyng, God kepe alway,
The quene and the bisshope of Canterbury,[259]
And other that have labored to thys love day,
God preserve them we pray hertly;
And Londone for they fulle diligently,
Kept the pees in trobull and in adversite;
To brynge yn rest they labored ful treuly;
Reioice Englond the peas and unite.

[Footnote 259: Cardinal John Bourchier. He was translated from Ely to
the Archiepiscopal see, on the 22nd April 1454, and died on the 30th
March 1486.]

Off thre things, y preys thys worshypfull Citee:
The ferst, of trewe feythe that they owe to the kyng;
The secounde, of love of eache comonialte;
The thyrde, of good rule evermore kepyng;
The whyche God mayntene ever long durynge,
And save the Maire and all the hole Citee,
And that ys amys brynge to amendyng,
That Englond may reioice the pees and unite.


IBID.

[_From the Cottonian MS._ Vespasianus B. XVI.]

Whan Charite is chosen with states to stonde,
Stedfas and stille without distaunce,
Than wrathe may be exiled out of this londe,
And God oure gide to have the governaunce.

Wisdom and wellthe with alle plesaunce,
May rightful regne and prosperite,
For love hath underlaide wrathful veniaunce;
Reioise Anglond oure lordes acorded to be.

Reiose and thanke God, for evermore;
For now shal encrese thi consolacion,
Oure enemyes quaken and dreden fulsore,
That peas is made ther was division,

Whiche to them is a gret confusion,
And to us ioy and felicite;
God hold them longe in every season:
That Anglond may reioise concord and unite.

Now is sorowe with shame fled in to Fraunce,
As a felon that hath forsworn this londe;
Love hath put out malicious governaunce,
In every place bothe fre and bonde;

In Yorke, in Somerset as I understonde,
In Warrewik also is love and charite,
In Sarisbury eke, and in Northumbrelande;
That every man may reioise concord and unite.

Egremown, and Clifford, with other forsaide,
Ben set in the same opynyon;
In every quarter love is thus laide,
Grace and wisdom hath thus the dominacion:

Awake Welthe, and walke in this region,
Rounde aboute in toun and cite,
And thanke them that brought hit to this concluson;
Reioise Anglond to concorde and unite.

At Poules in Londone, with gret renoun,
On oure Ladi day in Lente this peas was wrought;
The kinge, the quene, with lordes many oone,
To worship that virgine as thei ought,

Wenten a procession, and spariden right nought,
In sighte of alle the comynalte,
In token that love was in herte and thought;
Reiose Anglond in concorde and unite.

Ther was bytwyn them lovely contynaunce,
Whiche was gret ioy to alle that ther were,
That long tyme hadden be in variaunce;
As frendes for ever that had be in fere,

Thei wenten togeder, and made goud chere;
France and Britayn repente shul thei,
For the bargayn shul thei abye ful dere;
Reiose Anglond in concorde and unite.

Oure soveraigne lord kyng God kepe alwey,
The quene, and the archbisshope of Canterbury,
And the bisshop of Wynchestre chanceller of Anglond,
And other that han labured to this love day.

And London for thei ful diligently,
Kepten the peas in trowbel and adversite,
To bryng in reste thei labured ful truly;
Reioise Anglond in concorde and unite.

Of thre thynges I praise the worshipful Cite;
The first, the true faithe that thei have to the kyng;
The seconde, of love to the comynalte;
The thrid, goud rule for evermore kepynge;

The whiche God maynteyn evermore durynge,
And save the Maier and alle the worthi Cite;
And that is amys God brynge to amendynge,
That Anglond may reioise to concord and unite.

Neither of the ensuing articles, the whole of which are the production
of the indefatigable Lydgate, can possibly be assigned to its proper
date; and they are therefore arranged in the following order.

1. _A Balade sent by a Poursyant to the Shirreves of London,
acompanyed with theire Bretherne upon Mayes Daye, at Busshopes Wod, at
an honurable Dyner, ech of them bringginge his Dysshe._

This Ballad, which occurs in Ashmole's Collection of Manuscripts, is
introduced from its having been addressed to the Sheriffs of London;
but it contains little that is worthy of attention.

2. _London Lickpenny._

Of the numerous Ballads composed by 'The Monk of Bury,' this is
perhaps the most curious and the best known; and, from its presenting
a great deal of information relative to the Metropolis in the
fifteenth century, it is of considerable interest. Two copies exist in
MS. in the British Museum; one in the Harleian MS. 367, which is
printed in Noorthouck's and Dr. Pugh's History of London, as well as
in several other works; the other, in Stow's hand-writing, in the
Harleian MS. 542: and as they differ very materially from each other,
a copy of each is inserted. To this Ballad, it has been thought right
to add another, by the same writer, which has never been before
printed, on a very similar subject; namely,

3. _Upon the Emptiness of his Purse,--_

In which he treats this, perhaps the greatest of all human
misfortunes, since it prevents the alleviation of almost all others,
with singular address. The subject seems to have been a favourite one
with our early poets; for there is a Ballad with nearly the same title
by Chaucer; and another is printed in 'The Boke of St. Albans.'

4. _On Forked Head Dresses._

The head-dresses of females in the reign of Henry the Sixth closely
resembled the _cauchoises_ still worn by those of Normandy; and which
excited the displeasure of Dan John in so great a degree as to have
induced him to invoke the aid of his Muse in effecting their
abolition. It seems no subject escaped that eternal scribbler's
attention; and if his abilities had equalled his disposition, he would
probably have become the Juvenal of his age. Upon this occasion,
however, he appears to have soared on rather a higher wing than usual;
and the moral of his lay is the truism which has since been so
beautifully expressed, that loveliness

     "Is when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most."

5. _On Fraudulent Millers and Bakers._

This short Ballad would appear, from the following passage in Fabian's
Chronicle, to have been written in the 15th of Edw. IV. A^{o} 1475, if
it were not, that though the date of Lydgate's death has never been
precisely ascertained, yet it is scarcely possible he could have lived
to that year.

"This yere this mayer [Robert Bassett] dyd sharpe correccion upon
bakers, for makynge of lyght brede; in so moche thatt he sett dyverse
upon the pillory," &c.

A similar circumstance might however have occurred some years before,
notwithstanding that it is not noticed by the writers of the period.


A BALADE MADE BY LYDEGATE, SENT BY A POURSYANT TO THE SHIRREVES OF
LONDON, ACOMPANYED WITH THEIRE BRETHERNE UPON MAYES DAYE, AT BUSSHOPES

Mighty Flourra, goddes of freshe floures,
Whiche clothed hast the soyle in lousty grene;
Made buddes springe with his swete showres,
By influence of the sonnes so sheene,
To do plesaunce of entent ful clene,
Unto the states whiche that now sitte here;
Hath veere doune sent hir owen doughter dere,
Making the vertue that dured in the roote,
Called of clerkes, the vertue vegytable,
For to trascend moste holsome and moste sweete,
Into the crope this saysoun so greable.
The bawmy lykour is so comendable,
That it rejoythe with the fresshe moysture,
Man, beeste, and foole, and every creature,
Whiche hathe repressed, swaged, and bore doune,
The grevous constreinte of the frostes heere;
And caused foolis for joye of this saysonne,
To cheese their mates, thane by natures loore,
With al gladnesse theire courage to restore,
Sitting on bowes fresshly nowe to synge,
Veere for to save at his home comynge;

And with theire sweete sugre melodye,
Thanking Nature theire goddesse sovereyne,
That they nowe have no mater to compleyne,

With lousty gladnesse at Phebus uprysinge;
And to declare ye hys magnifysence,

After wynter's mighty prevolence
Avoydinge stormys of al adversytee.
For shee hathe brought al prosperitee
To alle the states of this regyoun,
At his comynge to fore youre hye renoun,
To the mighty prynces, the palme of theire victorie;
And til knighthode nowe, she dothe presente
Noblesse in armes, laude, honnour, and glorie;
Pees to the people, in al hir best entente,
With grace and mercy fully to consente,
That provydence of hys discressioun,
Avoyde discorde and al derysyoun.
Wynter shal passe of hevynesse and trouble;
Flowres shal springe of perfite charite;
In hertes there shal be no meninge double;
Buddes shal of trouthe and unytee;
Plenty for to exyle duplicytee;
Lordes to regne in theire noble puissance;
The people obeye with feythful obeyssaunce;
Of alle estates there shal bee oone ymage;
And princes first shal ocupye the hede;
And prudent juges to correcte outrages,
Shal trespassours consteynen under drede,
That innosentes in theire lowlyhede,
As truwe comunes may bee theire socour,
Truwly contune in theire faithful labour;
And by the grace of oure lorde Jhesu,
That holly chirche may have parseveraunce,
Bee faythfull founde in al pertinaunce,

And aldremen, whiche have the governaunce
Over the people, by vertue may abyde,
That noone oppression bee done to the pourayle.
Thus as the people of prudent pollycye,
Prynces of the right shal governe;
The chirche preye; the juges justefye;
And knighthode, manly, and prudently discerne,
Til light of trouthe so clerely the lanterne,
That rightewysnesse throughe this regyoune,

LONDON LICPENYE.

[_From the Copy in the Autograph of John Stow, in the Harleian MS._
542, f. 102.]

In London ther I was lent,
I saw myselfe where trouthe shuld be ateynte;
Fast to Westminstar ward I went,
To a man of lawe to make my complaynt;
I sayd for Maris love, that holy seynt,
Have pity on the powre that would procede;
I would gyve sylvar, but my purs is faynt,
For lacke of money I may not spede.

As I thrast thrughe out the thronge,
Among them all my hode was gonn;
Netheles I let not longe,
To Kyngs benche tyll I come;
Byfore a juge I knelyd anon,
I prayd hym for Gods sake he would take hede;
Full rewfully to hym I gan make my mone,
For lacke of money I may not spede.

Benethe hym set clerks a great rowt,
Fast they writen by one assent;
There stode up one and cryed round about,
Richard, Robert, and one of Kent:
I wist not wele what he ment,
He cried so thike there indede,
There were stronge theves shamed and shent,
But they that laked money mowght not spede.

Unto the Comon place y yowde thoo,
Where sat one with a sylker houde;
I dyd hym reverence as me ought to do;
I tolde hym my case as well as I coude,
And sayd all my goods by nowrd and by sowde,
I am defrawdyd with great falshed;
He would not geve me a momme of his mouthe,
For lake of money I may not spede.

Then I went me unto the Rollis,
Before the clerks of the Chauncerie;
There were many qui tollis,
But I herd no man speke of me;
Before them I knelyd upon my kne,
Shewyd them myne evedence, and they began to reade.
They seyde trewer thinge might there nevar be,
But for lacke of money I may not spede.

In Westminster hall I found one,
Went in a longe gown of ray;
I crowched and kneled before them anone,
For Marys love of helpe I gan them pray;
As he had be wrothe, he voyded away,
Bakward his hand he gan me byd,
I wot not what thow menest gan he say,
Ley downe sylvar, or here thow may not spede.

In all Westminstar hall I could find nevar a one,
That for me would do, thowghe I shuld dye;
Without the dores were Flemings grete woon;
Upon me fast they gan to cry,
And sayd, Mastar, what will ye cepen or by?
Fine felt hatts, spectacles for to rede;
Of this gay gere a great cawse why,
For lake of money I might not spede.

Then to Westminster gate y went,
When the sone was at highe prime;
Cokes to me, they toke good entent,
Called me nere, for to dyne,
And proferyd me good brede, ale, and wyne;
A fayre clothe they began to sprede,
Rybbes of beffe bothe fat and fine;
But for lacke of money I might not spede.

In to London I gan me hy;
Of all the lond it bearethe the prise,
Hot pescods, one gan cry,
Strabery rype, and chery in the ryse;
One bad me come nere and by some spice,
Pepar, and saffron, they gan me bede,
Clove, grayns, and flowre of rise;
For lacke of money I might not spede.

Then into Chepe I gan me drawne,
Where I sawe stond moche people;
One bad me come nere, and by fine cloth of lawne,
Paris thred coton and umple;
I seyd there upon I could no skyle,
I am not wont there to in dede,
One bad me by an hewre my hed to hele;
For lake of money I might not spede.

Then went I forth by London stone,
Thrught out all Canywike strete;
Drapors to me they called anone,
Grete chepe of clothe they gan me hete;
Then come ther one, and cried hot shepes fete;
Risshes faire and grene, anothar began to grede,
Bothe melwell and makarell I gran mete;
But for lacke of money I myght not spede.

Then I hied me into Est Chepe;
One cries ribes of befe, and many a pie;
Pewtar potts they clatteryd or a heape;
Ther was harpe, pipe, and sawtry;
Ye by cokke, nay by cokke, some began to cry;
Some sang of Jenken and Julian, to get themselves mede;
Ful fayne I wold hadd of that mynstralsie,
But for lacke of money I cowld not spede.

Into Cornhill anon I yede,
Where is moche stolne gere amonge;
I saw wher henge myne owne hode,
That I had lost in Westminstar amonge the throng;
Then I beheld it with lokes full longe,
I kenned it as well as I dyd my crede,
To be myne owne hode agayne; me thought it wrong,
But for lacke of money I might not spede.

Then came the Taverner, and toke me by the sleve,
And seyd Ser, a pint of wyn would yow assay?
Syr, qwod I, it may not greve,
For a peny may do no more then it may:
I dranke a pint, and therefore gan pay;
Sore a hungred away I yede,
For well London lykke peny for ones eye,
For lake of money I may not spede.

Then I hyed me to Byllingesgate,
And cried wagge wagge gow hens;
I praye a barge man, for Gods sake,
That they would spare me myn expens;
He sayde, ryse up, man, and get the hens,
What menist thow, I will do on the no almes dede,
Here scapeth no man byneth ij pens,
For lacke of money I myght not spede.

Then I conveyed me into Kent;
For of the law would I medle no more,
By caus no man to me would take entent,
I dight me to the plowe even as I did before.
Thus save London that in Bethelem was bore,
And every trew man of law God graunt hymsels med,
And they that be othar, God theyr state restore;
For he that lacketh money with them he shall not spede.

LONDON LYCKPENY.

A BALLADE COMPYLED BY DAN JOHN LYDGATE MONKE OF BERY, ABOUT ---- YERES
AGOE, AND NOW NEWLY OVERSENE AND AMENDED.

[_Harleian MSS._ 367, f. 126, 127.]

To London once, my stepps I bent,
Where trouth in no wyse should be faynt:
To Westmynster ward I forthwith went,
To a man of law to make complaynt.
I sayd, for Mary's love that holy saynt,
Pity the poore that would proceede;
But for lack of mony I cold not spede.

And as I thrust the prese amonge,
By froward chaunce my hood was gone;
Yet for all that I stayd not longe,
Tyll at the kynge bench I was come.
Before the judge I kneled anon,
And prayd hym for Gods sake to take heede;
But for lack of money I myght not spede.

Beneth them sat clarkes a great rout,
Which fast dyd wryte by one assent;
There stoode up one and cryed about,
Rychard, Robert, and John of Kent;
I wyst not wele what this man ment:
He cryed so thycke there indede,
But he that lackt mony myght not spede.

Unto the common place I yode thoo,
Where sat one with a sylken hoode;
I dyd hym reverence, for I ought to do so,
And told my case as well as I coud,
How my goods were defrauded me by falshood.
I gat not a mum of his mouth for my meed,
And for lack of mony I myght not spede.

Unto the Rolls I gat me from thence,
Before the clarkes of the chauncerye,
Where many I found earnyng of pence,
But none at all once regarded mee:
I gave them my playnt uppon my knee;
They lyked it well when they had it reade,
But lackyng mony I could not be sped.

In Westmynster hall I found out one,
Which went in a long gown of raye;
I crouched and kneled before hym anon:
For Maryes love, of help I hym praye.
I wot not what thou meanest, gan he say;
To get me thence he dyd me bede,
For lack of mony I cold not speed.

Within this hall, neithere ryche nor yett poor,
Wold do for me ought, although I shold dye;
Which seing, I gat me out of the doore,
Where Flemynge began on me for to cry,
Master, what will you copen or by,
Fyne felt hatts, or spectacles to reede?
Lay down your sylver, and here you may spede.

Then to Westmynster gate I presently went,
When the sonn was at hyghe pryme;
Cokes to me, they tooke good entent,
And profered me bread with ale and wyne,
Rybbs of befe both fat and ful fyne;
A fayre cloth they gan for to sprede,
But wantyng mony I might not be speede.

Then unto London I dyd me hye,
Of all the land it beareth the pryse;
Hot pescods one began to crye,
Straberry rype, and cherryes in the ryse:
One bad me come nere, and by some spyce,
Peper, and sayforne, they gan me bede;
But for lacke of money I myght not spede.

Then to the Chepe I began me drawne,
Where mutch people I sawe for to stande;
One ofred me velvet, sylke, and lawne,
An other he taketh me by the haunde,
Here is Parys thred, the fynest in the launde.
I never was used to such thyngs in dede,
And wanting mony I myght not spede.

Then went I forth by London stone,
Throughout all Canwyke streete;
Drapers mutch cloth me offred anone:
Then comes me one, cryd hot shepes feete,
One cryde makerell, ryshes grene, another gan greete,
One bad me by a hood to cover my head;
But fore want of mony I myght not be sped.

Then I hyed me into Estchepe;
One cryes rybbs of befe, and many a pye;
Pewter potts they clattered on a heape,
There was harpe, pype, and mynstrelsye;
Yea by cock, nay by cock, some began crye,
Some songe of Jenken and Julyan for there mede;
But for lack of mony I myght not spede.

Then into Cornhyll anon I yode,
Where was much stolen gere amonge;
I saw where honge myne owne hoode,
That I had lost amonge the thronge;
To by my own hood I thought it wronge,
I knew it well as I dyd my crede;
But for lack of mony I could not spede.

The Taverner took mee by the sleve;
Sir, sayth he, wyll you our wyne assay?
I answerd, that can not mutch me greve,
A peny can do no more than it may:
I dranke a pynt, and for it dyd pay;
Yet sore a hungerd from thence I yede,
And wantyng my mony I cold not spede.

Then hyed I me to Belyngsgate;
And one cryed hoo, go we hence;
I prayd a barge man for Gods sake,
That he wold spare me my expence.
Thou scapst not here, quod he, under ij pence,
I lyst not yet bestow my almes dede:
Thus lacking mony I could not speede.

Then I convayed me into Kent;
For of the law wold I meddle no more,
Because no man to me tooke entent,
I dyght me to do as I dyd before.
Now Jesus that in Bethlem was bore,
Save London, and send trew lawyers there mede,
For who so wants mony with them shall not spede.

UPON THE EMPTINESS OF HIS PURSE:

BY JOHN LYDGATE.

[_Harleian MSS._ 2255, _f._ 45^{b}.]

Riht myhty prynce, and it be your wille,
Condescende leiser for to take,
To seen the content of this litil bille,
Which whan I wrot, myn hand I felte quake;
Tokne of mornyng weryd clothys blake,
Cause my purs was falle in gret rerage;
Lynyng outward, his guttys wer out shake,
Oonly for lak of plate, and of coignage.

I souhte leechys for a restoratiff,
In whom I fond no consolacione;
Appotecaryes for a confortatiff;
Dragge nor dya was noon in Bury tone,
Botme of his stomak was tournyd up so done;
A laxatif did hym so gret outrage,
Made hym slendre by a consumpcione,
Oonly for lak of plate, and of coignage.

Ship was ther noon, nor seilis rede of hewe,
The wynd froward to make hem ther to londe;
The flood was passyd, and sodeynly of newe,
A lowh ground ebbe was faste by the stronde;
No maryneer durste take on honde,
To caste an ankir for streihtnesse of passage,
The custom skars, as fow may undirstonde,
Oonly for lak of plate, and of coignage.

Ther was no tokne sent done from the Tour,
As any gossomer the countirpeys was liht,
A fretyng etyk causyd his langour,
By a cotidian which heeld hym day and nyht:
Sol and Luna wer clypsyd of ther liht,
Ther was no cros nor preent of no visage,
His lynyng dirk, ther wer no platys briht,
Oonly for lak, and scarsete of coignage.

Harde to likke hony out of a marbil stoon,
For ther is nouthir licour nor moisture;
An ernest grote, whan it is dronke and goon,
Bargeyn of marchauntys stant in aventure.
My purs and I be callyd to the lure
Off indigence, our stuff leyd in morgage;
But ye, my lord, may al our soor recure,
With a receyt of plate, and of coignage.

Nat sugre plate maad by thappotecarye,
Plate of briht metal yevith a mery sone,
In Boklerys bury is noon such letuary;
Gold is a cordial, gladdest confeccione,
Ageyn etiques of oold consumpcione,
Auru' potabile, for folk ferre ronne in age,
In quynt essence best restauracione,
With silver plate, enprentyd with coignage.

O seely bille! why art thu nat ashamyd,
So malapertly to shewe out thy constreynt;
But povert hath so nyh thy tonne attamyd,
That nichil habet is cause of thy compleynt.
A drye tisyk makith oold men ful feynt;
Reediest weye to renewe ther corage,
Is a fresshe dragge of no spycis meynt,
But of a briht plate, enpreentyd with coignage.

Thu mayst afferme, as for thyn excus,
Thy bareyn soyl is sool and solitarye;
Of cros nor pyl ther is no reclus,
Preent nor impressione in al thy seyntuarye.
To conclude breefly, and nat tarye,
Ther is no noyse herd in thyn hermytage;
God sende soone a gladdere letuarye,
With a cleer sone of plate, and of coignage.

Off God and kynde procedith al bewte:
Crafft may shewe a foreyn apparence,
But nature ay must have the sovereynte:
Thyng countirfet hath noon existence,
Twen gold and gossomer is gret difference;
Trewe metal requerith noon allay,
Unto purpoos by cleer experyence;
Bewte wyl shewe, thouh hornes wer away.

Riche attires of gold, and perre,
Charbonclis, rubies of moost excellence,
Shewe in dirknesse, liht wher so they be,
By ther natural hevenly influence.
Doubletys of glas yeve a gret evidence;
Thyng contirfet wil faylen at assay:
On this mateer concludyng in sentence,
Bewte wyl shewe, thouh hornys wer away.

Aleyn remembryth his compleynt, who lyst see
In his book of famous eloquence;
Clad al in floures and blosmys of a tree,
He sawh Nature in hir moost excellence,
Upon hir hed a keverchef of Valence,
Noon othir richesse of countirfet array;
T'exemplefye by kyndly providence,
Bewte wil shewe, thouh hornys wer away.

Famous poetys of antiquyte,
In Grece and Troye, renoumyd of prudence,
Wroot of queen Helene, and Penelope,
Off Polyceene with hir chaast innocence:
For wyves trewe calle Lucrece to presence,
That they wer fayr, ther can no man sey nay;
Kynde wrouht hem with so gret dilligence,
Ther bewte couthe, hornys wer cast away.

Clerkys recorde by gret auctorite,
Hornys wer yove to beestys for diffence;
A thyng contrary to femynyte,
To be maad sturdy of resistence:
But arche wyves egre in ther violence,
Fers as tygre for to make affray,
They have despyt ageyn conscience,
Lyst nat of pryde, ther hornys cast away.

L'ENVOYE.

Noble Pryncessys, this litel shoort ditee,
Rewdly compiled, lat it be noon offence,
To your womanly merciful pitee,
Thouh it be rad in your audience:
Peysed ech thyng in your iust advertence,
So it be no displesaunce to your pay,
Undir support of your pacience,
Yevyth example, hornys to cast away.

Grettest of vertues is humylite,
As Salomon seith, sone of sapience,
Moost was accepted to the Deite.
Takith heed heer of yeuyth, to this woord credence,
How Maria, whiche hadde a premynence
Above alle women, in Bedleem whan she lay,
At Cristes birthe no cloth of gret dispence,
She weryd a keverche, hornys wer cast away.

Off birthe she was hihest of degre,
To whom alle aungelis did obedience;
Of David is lyne which sprang out of Jesse,
In whom alle vertues by iust convenience,
Maad stable in God, by goostly confidence:
This roose of Jerycho, ther greuh noon suych in May,
Poore in spirit, parfight in pacience,
In whoom alle hornys of pryde wer put away.

Moodir of J'hu, myrour of chastite,
In woord nor thouht that nevir did offence,
Trewe exemplaire of virginite,
Heedspryng and welle of parfit contynence,
Was nevir clerk, by rethoryk nor science
Kowde alle hir vertues reherse to this day;
Noble Pryncessys of meeke benyvolence,
B'example of hir, your hornys cast away.


ON FRAUDULENT MILLERS AND BAKERS.

[_Harleian MSS._ 2255.]

Put out his hed lyst nat for to dare,
But lyk a man upon that tour to abyde,
For cast of eggys wil not conys spare,
Tyl he be quaylled body, bak, and syde;
His heed endooryd, and of verray pryde,
Put out his armys, shewith abrood his face,
The fenestrallys be made for hym so wyde,
Cleymyth to been a capteyn of that place.

The bastyle longith of verray dewe ryght,
To fals bakerys it is trewe herytage;
Severelle to them, this knoweth every wight,
Be kynde assyngned for ther sittyng stage,
Wheer they may freely shewe out ther visage,
Whan they take oonys there possessione,
Owthir in youthe or in myddyl age,
Men doon hem wrong yif they take hym done.

Let mellerys and bakerys gadre hem a gilde,
And alle of assent make a fraternite;
Undir the pillory a litil chapell bylde,
The place amorteyse and purchase liberte,
For alle thoo that of ther noumbre be;
Whatevir it coost afftir that they wende,
They may cleyme be just auctorite,
Upon that bastile to make an ende.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
