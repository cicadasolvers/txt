Of Lemmons.


[Illustration: Lemmon.]


_A Lemmon Sallet._

Take Lemmons, rub them upon a Grate, to make their rinds smooth, cut
them in halves, take out the meat of them, and boyle them in faire
water a good while, changing the water once or twice in the boyling,
to take away the bitternesse of them, when they are tender take them
out and scrape away all the meat (if any be left) very cleane, then
cut them as thin as you can (to make them hold) in a long string, or
in reasonable short pieces, and lay them in your glasse, and boyling
some of the best _White_-wine vineger with shugar, to a reasonable
thin Syrupe, powre it upon them into your glasse, and keep them for
your use.


_To Preserve Oranges or Lemmons_.

Take your _Oranges_ or _Lemmons_, lay them in water three dayes, and
three nights, to take away their bitternesse, then boyle them in faire
water till they be tender, make as much Syrupe for them as will make
them swim about the pan, let them not boyle too long therein, for it
will make the skins tough; then let them lie all night in the Syrupe,
to make them take the Syrupe in the morning, boyle the Syrupe to his
thicknesse, and put them in gally pots or glasses, to keep all the
yeare, and this is the best way to Preserve _Orenges, Lemmons_, or
_Citrons_.


_To make Past of Lemmons_.

Take halfe a dozen of thick-rined _Lemmons_, cut them through the
middest, and boyle them tender in faire water, then stamp them in a
Morter, strayne the juyce or pulp from them, and dry it, and put two
pound of _Shugar_ to it, then make it into what fashion you will, on a
sheet of white paper, dry it in an Oven, and turne it often for two
dayes and two nights, for in that time it will be dry enough; box it
thus up, and it will endure all the Yeare.


_Sweet Bagges to lay amongst Linnen_.

Take _Orris, Cypris, Calamus, Fusis_, all of them grosse beaten, and
_Gallingall_ roots, of each a handfull, and as much of the small tops
of _Lavender_, dryed, and put them into baggs to lay among your
cloaths. You may put in a handfull or two of _Damask Rose_ leaves
dryed, which will somewhat better the sent.




Medicines made of Lemmons.


_To take away the Spots, or red Pimpels of the face_.

Take halfe a pint of raine water, and halfe a pint of good _Verjuice_,
seeth it till it be halfe consumed, then whilst it boils fill it up
againe with juyce of _Lemmon_, and so let it seeth a pretty while;
then take it from the fire, and when it is cold put to it the whites
of four new laid Eggs, well beaten, and with this water annoynt
the place often.


_A very good Medicine for the Stone_.

Make a Posset of a quart of _Rhenish_ wine, a pint of _Ale_ and a
pint of _Milke_, then take away the curd, and put into the drink,
two handfulls of Sorrell, one handfull of _Burnet_, and halfe a handfull
of _Balm_, boyle them together a good while, but not too long,
least the drink be too unpleasant, then take of the drink a quarter
of a pint, or rather halfe a pint, at once, at morning, and to bed-ward,
putting therein first two or three spoonfulls of juice of _Lemmons_,
this is an excellent Medicine for the _Stone in the Kidneyes_, to
dissolve and bring it away. It is very good in these Diseases of the
_Stone_, to use _Burnet_ often in your drink at Meales, and often to
steep it in over night, and in the morning put in three or foure
spoonfulls of juice of _Lemmons_, and to drink thereof a good
draught every morning a week together, about the full of the
Moone, three dayes before, and three dayes after.


_To roste a Shoulder of Mutton with Lemmons_.

Take a Shoulder of _Mutton_ halfe rosted, cut off most of the meat
thereof, in thin slices, into a faire dish with the gravy thereof, put
thereto about the quantity of a pint of clarret wine, with a spoonfull
or two at most of the best wine _Vineger_, season it with _Nutmeggs_,
and a little _Ginger_, then pare off the rines of one or two
good _Lemmons_, and slice them thin into the _Mutton_, when it is almost
well stewed between two dishes, and so let them stew together
two or three warmes, when they are enough, put them in a clean
dish, and take the shoulder blade being well broyled on a
grid-iron, and lay it upon your meat, garnishing your dishes
with some slices and rinds of the _Lemmons_, and so serve it.


_To Boyle A Capon with Oranges and Lemmons_.

Take _Orenges_ and _Lemmons_ peeled, and cut them the long way,
and if you can keep your cloves whole, and put them into your
best Broth of _Mutton_ or _Capon_, with _Prunes_ or _Currants_ three or
four dayes, and when they have been well sodden, cut whole _Pepper_,
great _Mase_, a great peice of _Suggar_, some _Rose_-water, and either
_White_ wine, or _Clarret_ wine, and let all these seeth together a
while, and serve it upon Sopps with your _Capon_.


_A Lemmond Sallet_.

Cut out slices of the peele of the Lemmons, long wayes, a quarter
of an inch one piece from another, and then slice the _Lemmons_
very thin, and lay them in a dish crosse, and the peeles about

       *       *       *       *       *




_Of Quinces_.


_The best way to Preserve Quinces._

First pare and coare the _Quinces_, and boyle them in faire water
till they be very tender, not covering them, then taking them
out of the water, take to every pound of them, two pound of _Sugar_,
and half a pint of water, boyle it to a Syrupe, scumming it well,
then put in some of the Jelly that is washed from the _Quince_ kernels,
and after that, making it boyle a little, put in your _Quinces_,
boyle them very fast, keeping the holes upward as neer as you
can, for fear of breaking, and when they are so tender that you
may thrust a rush through them, take them off, and put them up
in your glasses, having first saved some Syrupe till it be cold to fill
up your glasses.


_A speciall Remembrance in doing them_.

When you Preserve _Quinces_, or make _Marmalade_, take the Kernels
out of the raw _Quinces_, and wash off the Jelly that groweth
about them, in faire water, then straine the water and Jelly from
the kernels, through some fine Cobweb laune, and put the same
into the _Marmalade_, or preserved _Quinces_, when they are well
scum'd, but put not so much into your _Quinces_, as into the _Marmalade_,
for it will Jelly the Syrupe too much; put six or seven
spoonfulls of Syrupe into the Jelly. Before you put it into the
_Marmalade_, you must boyle your _Quinces_ more for _Marmalade_, then
to preserve your _Quinces_, and least of them when you make your
clear Cakes.

When you would preserve your _Quinces_ white, you must not
cover them in the boyling, and you must put halfe as much _Sugar_
more for the white, as for the other. When you would have them
red, you must cover them in the boyling.


[Illustration: Quince]


_To Pickle Quinces._

Boyle your _Quinces_ that you intend to keep, whole and unpared,
in faire water, till they be soft, but not too violently for feare you
break them, when they are soft take them out, and boyle some
_Quinces_ pared, quarter'd, and coar'd, and the parings of the _Quinces_
with them in the same liquor, to make it strong, and when
they have boyled a good time, enough to make the liquor of
sufficient strength, take out the quartered _Quinces_ and parings,
and put the liquor into a pot big enough to receive all the _Quinces_,
both whole and quartered, and put them into it, when the
liquor is thorow cold, and so keep them for your use close
covered.


_To make Quince Cakes_.

Prepare your _Quinces_, and take the just weight of them in _Sugar_,
beaten finely, and searcing halfe of it, then of the rest make
a Syrupe, using the ordinary proportion of a pint of water to a
pound of _Sugar_, let your _Quinces_ be well beaten, and when the
Syrupe is cand height, put in your _Quince_, and boyle it to a past,
keeping it with continuall stirring, then work it up with the beaten
_Sugar_ which you reserved, and these Cakes will tast well of the
_Quinces_.


_To make Printed Quidony of Quinces_.

Take two pound of _Quinces_, paired, coared, and cut in small
pieces, and put them into a faire posnet, with a quart of faire water,
and when they are boyled tender, put into them one pound
of _Sugar_ clarified, with halfe a pint of faire water, let them boyle
till all the fruit fall to the bottom of the posnet, then let the liquid
substance run through a faire linnen cloath into a clean bason,
then put it into a posnet, and let it boyle till it come to a jelly,
then Print it in your Moulds, and turne it into your boxes. You
shall know when it is ready to Print, by rouling it on the back of
a Spoone.

_Of Roses_.


_To make sweet Bagges to lay Linnen in_.

Take _Damask Rose_ budds, pluck them, and dry the leaves in the
shadow, the tops of _Lavender_ flowers, sweet _Margerom_, and _Basill_,
of each a handfull, all dryed and mingled with the _Rose_ leaves, take
also of _Benjamin, Storax, Gallingall_ roots, and _Ireos_ or _Orris_ roots,
twice as much of the Orris as of any of the other, beaten in fine
powder: a peece of cotten wool wetted in _Rose_-water, and put
to it a good quantity of _Musk_ and _Ambergreece_ made into powder,
and sprinkle them with some _Civet_ dissolved in _Rose_-water, lay the
Cotten in double paper, and dry it over a chaffin dish of coales:
Lastly, take halfe a handfull of _Cloves_, and as much _Cinamon_ bruised,
not small beaten, mixe all these together, and put them up in
your Bagge.


_A very good Poultis for any Member swell'd and inflamed,
and not broken, to take away the paine_.

Take three pints of new milk, of stale Manchet crums two handfulls,
or so much as shall make the milk somewhat thick, and thereto
put two handfulls of dryed red _Rose_ leaves, and three ounces of
Oyle of _Roses_, boyle all these together to the thicknesse of a Poultisse,
then let it stand and coole, and while it cooleth rake a spoonfull
of Oyle of _Roses_, and with a warm hand rub the place grieved,
till the Oyle be dryed in, and then lay the Poultisse as warm as you
may endure it, to the part inflamed; doe this morning and evening
for three or four dayes, as you shall see cause.


_To make a sweet Cake, and with it a very sweet water._

Take _Damask Rose_ leaves, _Bay_ leaves, _Lavinder_ tops, sweet _Marjerome_
tops, _Ireos_ powder, _Damask_ powder, and a little _Musk_ first
dissolved in sweet water, put the _Rose_ leaves and hearbs into a Bason,
and sprinkle a quarter of a pint of _Rose_-water among them,
and stirring them all together, cover the Bason close with a dish,
and let them stand so covered, all night, in the morning Distill
them, so shall you have at once an excellent sweet water, and a
very fine sweet Cake to lay among your finest linnen.


_Oyle of Roses._

Take Sallet Oyle and put it into an earthen pot, then take _Rose_
leaves, clip off all the white, and bruise them a little, and put them
into the Oyle, and then stop the top close with past, and set it into
a boyling pot of water, and let it boyle one hour, then let it stand
al one night upon hot embers, the next day take the Oyle, and
straine it from the _Rose_ leaves, into a glasse, and put therein some
fresh _Rose_ leaves, clipt as before, stop it, and set it in the Sun every
day for a fortnight or three weeks.


_Syrupe of Roses._

Take _Damask Roses_, clip off the white of them, and take six
ounces of them to every pint of faire water, first well boyled and
scummed, let them stand so as abovesaid, twelve hours, as you doe
in the Syrupe of _Violets_, wringing out the _Roses_ and putting in new
eight times, then wringing out the last put in onely the juice of
four ounces of _Roses_, so make it up as before, if you will put in
_Rubarb_, take to every two drams, slice it, string it on a thred, hang
it within the pot after the first shifting, and let it infuse within your
_Roses_: Some use to boyle the _Rubarb_ in the Syrupe, but it is dangerous,
the Syrupe purgeth _Choller_ and _Melancholly_.


_A Conserve of Roses._

Take red _Rose_ buds, clip of all the white, bruised, and withered
from them, then weigh them out, and taking to every pound of
_Roses_ three pound of _Sugar_, stamp the _Roses_ by themselves very
small putting a little juice of _Lemmons_ or _Rose_ water to them as
they wax dry, when you see the _Roses_ small enough, put the _Sugar_
to them, and beat them together till they be well mingled,
then put it up in Gally pots or glasses; in like manner are the
Conserverves of Flowers, of _Violets, Cowslips, Marigolds, Sage_, and
_Sea boise_ made.


_To Preserve Roses or any other Flowers._

Take one pound of _Roses_, three pound of _Sugar_, one pint of
_Rose_ water, or more, make your Syrupe first, and let it stand till it
be cold, then take your _Rose_ leaves, having first clipt off all the
white, put them into the cold Syrupe, then cover them, and set
them on a soft fire, that they may but simper for two or three
hours, then while they are hot put them into pots or glasses for
your use.


_How to Preserve Barbaries._

First take the fairest _Barbaries_, and of them the greatest bunches
you can get, and with a needle take out the stones on the one
side of them, then weigh out to every halfe pound of them one
pound of _Sugar_, put them into a Preserving pan, strow the _Sugar_
on them, and let them boyle a quarter of an hour softly, then taking
out the _Barbaries_ let the Syrupe boyle a quarter of an hour more,
then put in the _Barbaries_ againe, and let them boyle a pretty while
with the Syrupe, then take them from the Syrupe, and let them
both stand till they be cold, and so put them up.


_To keep Barbaries to garnish your Meat._

Take the worst of them, and boyle them in faire water, and
straine the liquor from them, and while the liquor is hot put it into
your _Barbaries_, being clean picked, and stop them up, and if they
mould much, wash them throughly in the liquor, then boyle the
liquor againe, and strayne it, and let it coole, then put it to your
_Barbaries_ againe.

[Illustration: A Rose]


_Conserve of Barbaries._

Take your _Barbaries_, pick them clean in faire branches, and
wash them clean, and dry them on a cloath, then take some other
_Barbaries_, and boyle them in _Clarret_ wine till they be very soft,
then straine them, and rub them so well through the strainer, that
you may know the substance of them, and boyle up this matter
thus strained out, till it be very sweet, and somwhat thick, then setting
it by till it be cold, and then put in your branches of _Barbaries_
into gally pots, or glasses, and fill it up with the cold Syrupe,
and so shall you have both Syrupe, and also _Barbaries_, to use at
your pleasure.

quarter of an hour, till it will stand, which you shall try thus,
set a saucer in a little cold water, so that none come into it, and
put a spoonfull of the Leach into it, and if you see that stand, rake
the other off the fire, then you may slice it in what fashion you
please.


_To make Almond Butter_.

Blanch one pound of _Almonds_, or more; or lesse, as you please,
lay them four hours in cold water, then stamp them with some
Rose water, as fine as you can, put them in a cloath, and presse

turne it after one boyling, being turned, take it off, cast it abroad
upon a linnen cloath, being holden between two, then with a
spoon take off the Whey under the cloath, so long as any will
drop or run, then take so much of the finest Sugar you can get, as
will sweeten it, and melt it in as much Rose-water as will serve to
dissolve it, put thereto so much _Saffron_ in fine powder, as will colour

_How to keep Cucumbers._

Take a kettle big enough for your use, halfe full of water, make
it brackish with salt, boyle therein ten or twenty _Cucumbers_, cut
in halves, then take the raw _Cucumbers_, being somewhat little,
and put them into the vessell wherein you will keep them, and
when your liquor is cold straine so much of it into them, as may
keep the _Cucumbers_ alwayes covered.


_To keep boyled Cucumbers._

Take a kettle of water, put salt to it, boyle it well, then take
your raw _Cucumbers_, put them into it, and keep them with turning
up and downe very softly, till they be as it were per-boyled,
then take them out, and lay them aside till they be cold, then put
them up in the vessel you will keep them in, and when the liquor
is cold, straine it into them, till they be all covered.


_To Pickle Cucumbers to keep all the yeare._

Pare a good quantity of the rindes of _Cucumbers_, and boyle
them in a quart of running water, and a pint of wine _Vineger_,

till the liquor be quite cold, pour out the liquor from the rinds,
into some little barrel, earthen pot, or other vessel, that may be
close stopped, and put as many of the youngest _Cucumbers_ you can
gather, therein, as the liquor will cover, and so keep them close
covered, that no winde come to them, to use all the year till they
have new; if your _Cucumbers_ be great, 'tis best to boyle them in
the liquor till they be soft.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
