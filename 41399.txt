INTRODUCTION


If the English are singularly incurious about their Navy, that attitude
must not be thought to imply neglect. On the contrary, it is a blend of
admiration, respect, and, above all, confidence, induced very largely by
the Navy itself. For so long has the Navy minded its own silent business
that we--otherwise so inquisitive a people--have come to look upon it as
beyond examination and (normally too eager to cut open the drum and
explore its resources) trustfully to leave it to its own devices,
conscious that those devices are wholly in our own interests. As Matthew
Arnold said in his sonnet to Shakespeare:

    _Others abide our question, thou art free--_

so do we address the Navy. For, although it baffles curiosity and ends
by eliminating it, it is only to substitute faith. We do not take for
granted all the things that we cannot understand: sometimes, indeed, we
deny them; but we are satisfied to take for granted the Navy. We know
that it is there. Where "there" is we may have no notion; by "there" we
mean probably everywhere. The Navy is not only there, the Navy is
everywhere, and therefore all's well. That is our simple creed.

A further cause for this quiet and unusual acceptivity is to be found in
the medium in which the Navy works--the sea itself. The sea has ever
been a barrier to investigation, and the Navy and the sea are one.
Public opinion is land-made, and landsmen have neither time nor
inclination to cope with the riddles of the ocean, which to most of us
is vague and inimical, the home of risks and discomforts which it is
wiser to avoid. Well content to consider her, from a safe distance, as a
Sphinx, we are very happy that to others has fallen the perilous lot of
patrolling her and very full of gratitude for their courage and
success.

If the Army, on the contrary, is so much under the microscope, it is
largely because it has few or no mysteries. We know the rules. Armies
are made up of men like ourselves (only better). They advance as we do,
by putting one foot before another, on the solid earth. Their movements
are followable, even if we cannot always understand them; daily
bulletins are printed in the public Press. But the Navy keeps its
secrets. Not only have we no notion where it is, but we should be little
the wiser as to its inner purposes if, scanning the illimitable and
capricious waves, it should be our fortune to descry here and there a
flotilla of its dark grey hulls. Even in harbour most men pointing out a
cruiser to their children say "That's a dreadnought"--a state of
confusion bred and fostered by the strange, dark, dangerous element in
which the Navy has its being.

So much for the causes of our odd willingness to forego one of the chief
privileges of British birthright, which is to criticise, even to
belittling, all that is ours. But there is justification, too, as the
state of the sea to-day testifies. Thanks to the Navy there is at this
moment hardly an enemy ship at large on the surface of the waters. The
Kaiser's darling ironclads are idle as painted ships upon a painted
ocean: not even an ocean, a canal. Our troops in millions have crossed
to the Continent. We have enough to eat.

By what wonders of efficiency and discipline, machinery and
co-ordination, this result has been brought about we neither know nor
are concerned to enquire. Enough that it is. But when it comes to
_personnel_, curiosity is legitimate; and this collection of portraits
and brief biographies has been prepared in the belief that very many of
those whose lives have been rendered secure by these efforts of the Navy
would like to see what manner of men are in control of our safeguards.
This is the heyday of the picture, and here are the pictures of our
leading sailors--the commanders who stand between us and the foe and
keep the foe at bay.

Charles Lamb (who was less of a sea-dog even than most men) confessed in
old age that he once sat to an artist friend for the portraits of
sixteen British Admirals. Mr. Dodd (even could a sitter of such notable
companionableness be now found) would have forced himself to dispense
with the fun of using him, for verisimilitude's sake, because all these
heads have been drawn from life and are reproduced as nearly as possible
in the colours of life. Looking over the forty and more Naval heroes
whom he has limned, one is struck by a generic likeness which is deeper
than such superficial similarity as the service beard can confer. Most
of the Admirals look like Admirals--and is there a better thing to be?
Certainly there is no better word. Not only have their ability and
courage and character united to lift them to high position and
authority; but here, again, we discern the subtle and penetrating
influence of the sea, a mistress who will allow no relaxation of
vigilance or toil, so swiftly and dangerously changeable can she be.
Hence the keen eyes, the level gaze, of all who would understand and
cope with her, and noticeably of all this gallant company.

In the present work the emphasis is laid rather upon the illustrations
than the letterpress. It is a gallery of portraits rather than a series
of biographies such as "The Lives of the British Admirals," which was
written by Dr. John Campbell, and, with periodical additions, so long
held the field. The time for such biographies happily is not yet. But
when it comes may there be some victories (already, of course, there are
three or four) to record as decisive and as noble as those in Campbell's
volumes!

ADMIRAL SIR JOHN R. JELLICOE, G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O.


ADMIRAL SIR JOHN RUSHWORTH JELLICOE, G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O., was born on
December 5th, 1859. He was educated at Rottingdean, and entered the Navy
in 1872, becoming in 1880 a Lieutenant (three First Class Certificates).
As a young officer he specialised in Gunnery.

During the Egyptian War, as Lieutenant of the "Agincourt," he gained the
Egyptian Medal and Khedive's Bronze Star. In 1883 he received a special
L80 prize at the Royal Naval College.

In May, 1886, Lieutenant Jellicoe was awarded the Board of Trade Silver
Medal for having commanded a gig, manned by volunteers, which set out to
rescue the crew of a steamer stranded on a sandbank near Gibraltar. A
heavy sea was running and the boat capsized, but the crew, being
provided with cork jackets, managed to reach the shore in safety.

Lieutenant Jellicoe was Assistant to the Director of Naval Ordnance from
1888 to 1891, on June 30th of which year he became a Commander, and was
serving in the "Victoria" when she foundered off Tripoli after collision
with the "Camperdown" on June 27th, 1893. At the time of the catastrophe
Commander Jellicoe was suffering from Mediterranean fever. He was
promoted to Captain on January 1st, 1897. During the Boxer outbreak in
1900 he was Flag-Captain in the "Centurion," and took part in Admiral
Sir E. H. Seymour's International Expedition to relieve the Pekin
Legations. In this Expedition he acted as Chief Staff Officer, was
wounded, and afterwards received the C.B. for his services.

[Illustration: ADMIRAL SIR JOHN R. JELLICOE]

He was Naval Assistant to the Controller of the Navy from February,
1902, to August, 1903; Captain of the "Drake" from August, 1903, to
January, 1905; and Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes from 1905
to August, 1907. In the previous March he had been made Aide-de-Camp to
the King, a post which he held until February 8th, 1907, when he became
an Admiral. From August, 1907, to August, 1908, he was Rear-Admiral in
the Atlantic Fleet, becoming Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy
at the end of 1908. He commanded the Atlantic Fleet in 1910, with the
rank of Acting Vice-Admiral, and on the occasion of King George V.'s
Coronation he was made a K.C.B. In 1911 he commanded the Second Division
of the Home Fleet, becoming a Vice-Admiral on September 18th of that
year. On December 9th, 1912, he was appointed Second Sea Lord.

On the outbreak of war on August 4th, 1914, he was given Chief Command
of the Grand Fleet, with the acting rank of Admiral. He was in supreme
command at the Battle of Jutland.

In recognition of his services during the war, he received the G.C.B. on
February 8th, 1915, and an Order in Council, dated November 10th, 1914,
laid down that "Admiral Jellicoe on his promotion to the rank of Admiral
is to retain seniority as Admiral of August 4th, 1914, while holding his
present command."

On May 31st, 1916, Admiral Jellicoe received the Order of Merit.

On December 4th, 1916, he became First Sea Lord, the title "Chief of
Naval Staff" being added on May 31st, 1917.

Admiral Jellicoe holds the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, the
Russian Order of St. George (Third Class), the Order of the First Class
of the Rising Sun with Paulounia, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of
Leopold, also the French and Belgian Croix de Guerre and the Grand Cross
of the Military Order of Savoy.

No biographical notice of Sir John Jellicoe would be complete without a
mention of his father, who was, in his day, a well-known and
distinguished Captain in the Merchant Service. It is pleasant to
remember that Captain Jellicoe lived to see his son in command of the
Grand Fleet during the greatest war in history. This close connection
between the two branches of sea service is also peculiarly happy and
appropriate. Admiral Patton, a great-grandfather on his mother's side,
was Second Sea Lord during the Trafalgar campaign.

ADMIRAL SIR CECIL BURNEY, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.


ADMIRAL SIR CECIL BURNEY, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., was born in 1858 and
received his education at the Royal Naval Academy, Gosport; he served as
a Lieutenant of the "Carysfoot" during the Egyptian war, and also in the
Naval and military operations near Suakin in the Eastern Soudan. For
these services he received the Egyptian Medal, Khedive's Bronze Star and
Suakin Clasp.

As a Lieutenant of the "Hecate" Admiral Burney performed a singularly
gallant action. His ship having gone outside Plymouth Breakwater for gun
trials, a carpenter's mate engaged in some work on the outside of a
turret slipped overboard, striking his head as he fell. Lieutenant
Burney and Mr. Berridge, gunner, at once plunged to the rescue and
succeeded in supporting the man till one of the boats, which
unfortunately were stowed inboard owing to gun practice, could be got
ready to go to their assistance.

In 1906-7 Admiral Burney was Aide-de-Camp to King Edward VII. He was
Rear-Admiral of Plymouth Home Fleet, 1909-10, a member of the Admiralty
Submarine Committee, 1910-11; Rear-Admiral Commanding Fifth Cruiser
Squadron, February, 1911; Acting Vice-Admiral Commanding Third Battle
Squadron (formerly Atlantic Fleet), in December of the same year and
Vice-Admiral in September, 1912.

In April, 1913, he became second in command in the Mediterranean and
Senior Officer of the International Squadron ordered to blockade the
coast of Montenegro, and in May of the same year he was appointed Chief
to the Commission to administer the affairs of Scutari on behalf of the
Powers.

[Illustration: ADMIRAL SIR CECIL BURNEY]

Vice-Admiral Burney received the K.C.B. on King George's Birthday in
1913, and the K.C.M.G. in October of the same year, in which he also
received the command of the Second and Third Fleets.

At the Battle of Jutland he was second in command of the Grand Fleet and
was mentioned in despatches. He became a G.C.M.G. and Admiral in 1916,
being decorated Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour for his war
services in the same year. In 1916 he was also appointed Second Sea Lord
of the Admiralty. He also holds the Order of St. Vladimir (Second Class)
with swords, the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Maurice and St.
Lazarus, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.

Admiral Burney retired from the post of Second Sea Lord in August, 1917,
and in October was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the East Coast of
Scotland in succession to the late Admiral Sir Frederick Hamilton.

Medal and the Khedive's Bronze Star. He became a Lieutenant on July
27th, 1884.

As a young officer, Admiral Madden specialized in Torpedo work, and from
1893 to 1896 was First Lieutenant and Staff Officer of the "Vernon"

Fleet, and was specially granted the acting rank of Vice-Admiral on June
11th, 1915. He was present at the Battle of Jutland and was appointed a
K.C.M.G. for his services on that occasion.

In his despatch, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe said of Vice-Admiral Madden,
"Throughout a period of twenty-one months of war his services have been
of inestimable value. His good judgment, his long experience in fleets,
special gift for organization, and his capacity for unlimited work, have
all been of the greatest assistance to me, and have relieved me of much
of the anxiety inseparable from the conduct of the Fleet during the war.
In the stages leading up to the Fleet action, and during and after the
action, he was always at hand to assist, and his judgment was never at
fault.

"I owe him more than I can say."

Vice-Admiral Madden was made a K.C.B. on January 1st, 1916, a K.C.M.G.
on May 31st, and confirmed as a Vice-Admiral on June 10th of the same

VICE-ADMIRAL SIR REGINALD HUGH SPENCER BACON, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., D.S.O.,
was born in September, 1863, and entered the Navy in 1877. In 1883 he
became a Lieutenant (Five Firsts and promotion marks). In 1887 he joined

Commander of the "Theseus," he served in the punitive Naval expedition
commanded by Rear-Admiral Rawson, C.B., and took part in the landing and
capture of Benin City in February, 1897. It was in connection with this
campaign that he wrote "Benin, the City of Blood." As Chief of the
Intelligence Department, he was mentioned in despatches, received the
General African Medal, Benin Clasp, and the D.S.O.

He was the first Inspecting Captain of Submarines, and held the
appointment from March, 1901, till October, 1904, being in charge of the
Submarine Service during that time. He was Naval Assistant to the First
Sea Lord from October, 1904, to December, 1905; the first Captain of
H.M.S. "Dreadnought," 1906-07, and Flag-Captain and Chief of the Staff
in the Home Fleet in the latter year. From August, 1907, to December,
1909, Rear-Admiral Bacon was Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes.

On the occasion of King Edward VII.'s Review of the Home Fleet in the
Solent he received the C.V.O., and was Aide-de-Camp to the King from

[Illustration: VICE-ADMIRAL SIR REGINALD BACON]

Having retired in 1909 to take up the post of Managing Director of the
Coventry Ordnance Works, he returned to service in January, 1915, as
Officer Commanding the Siege Brigade, Royal Marines, with temporary rank

and was also created Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold by the King
of the Belgians in November, 1916. In 1917 he received the Belgian Croix
de Guerre.




VI

VICE-ADMIRAL SIR JOHN MICHAEL de ROBECK, K.C.B.


VICE-ADMIRAL SIR JOHN MICHAEL de ROBECK, K.C.B., received his Naval
education on board the "Britannia," and entered the Royal Navy as a
cadet in 1875. He became a Lieutenant on September 30th, 1885, a
Commander on the June 22nd, 1897, and a Captain on January 1st, 1902.

From February 15th, 1911, to December 21st of the same year he was
Inspecting Captain of Boys' Training Establishments. On December 1st,
1911, he became a Rear-Admiral. From April 8th, 1912, to May 1st, 1914,
he was Admiral of Patrols, being the first occupant of that post.

On the outbreak of war he commanded a Cruiser Force, and on the
retirement through illness of Vice-Admiral Carden in 1915 he was
appointed acting Vice-Admiral in Command of the British Eastern
Mediterranean Squadron at the Dardanelles, March 17th, and directed the
Naval operations carried out in March and April of that year. It was
during this period that the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was landed
and firmly established on the Gallipoli Peninsula. In his despatch
published in the "London Gazette," July 6th, 1915, General Sir Ian
Hamilton said, "Throughout the events I have chronicled, the Royal Navy
has been father and mother to the Army. Not one of us realises how much
he owes to Vice-Admiral de Robeck." Later in the year Sir Ian Hamilton
wrote: "The sheet-anchor on which hung the whole of these elaborate
schemes was the Navy. One tiny flaw in the mutual trust and confidence
animating the two services would have wrecked the whole enterprise.
Experts at a distance may have guessed as much: it was self-evident to
the rawest private on the spot. But with men like Vice-Admiral de
Robeck, Commodore Roger Keyes, Rear-Admiral Christian, and Captain F.
H. Mitchell at our backs, we soldiers were secured against any such
risk, and it will be seen how perfect was the precision the sailors put
into their job."

[Illustration: VICE-ADMIRAL SIR JOHN M. DE ROBECK]

Vice-Admiral de Robeck also commanded the Naval Forces which took part
in the evacuation of the Gallipoli Peninsula between November 20th,
1915, and January 9th, 1916.

He was appointed a K.C.B. on January 1st, 1916, in recognition of the
services he had rendered during the war.

He is a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, and holds the Japanese
Order of the Sacred Treasure (First Class), and the Grand Cross of the
Order of the Crown of Italy.

VICE-ADMIRAL TREVYLYAN DACRES WILLES NAPIER, C.B., M.V.O.


VICE-ADMIRAL TREVYLYAN DACRES WILLES NAPIER, C.B., M.V.O., entered the
Navy as a cadet in 1880, becoming a midshipman two years later. He
served in the Egyptian War on board the "Minotaur," receiving the
Egyptian Medal and Khedive's Bronze Star.

On February 14th, 1887, he was promoted Lieutenant, becoming a Commander
on January 1st, 1899. He served in command of a Destroyer Flotilla, and
in the Royal Yacht and attained the rank of Captain on June 30th, 1903.

Between 1904 and 1907 he was Flag-Captain to Admiral Sir John Durnford
on the Cape Station, and from 1907 to 1910 commanded the Royal Naval
College at Dartmouth, and commanded the "Bellerophon" from 1910 to 1912.

He was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the King on January 14th, 1913, and on
July 1st of the same year was appointed Commodore in command of the
Second Light Cruiser Squadron, which command he held till December 1st.

[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL T. D. W. NAPIER]

On October 24th, 1913, he became a Rear-Admiral. He has served afloat in
the war from December, 1914, to the present time, and for his services
received the C.B. on June 3rd, 1916. He was also mentioned in despatches
for his services in the Battle of Jutland, in which he commanded the
Third Light Cruiser Squadron. The Squadron had a difficult role to
perform throughout the battle. With the First Light Cruiser Squadron it
formed the screen of Sir David Beatty's Battle Cruiser Squadrons at
the opening of the battle, and later in the day protected the head of
the line from torpedo attack by light cruisers and destroyers. It
attacked the German Battle Cruisers with torpedoes and gun fire.
"Rear-Admiral Napier deserves great credit for his determined and
effective attack."

He holds the Order of St. Stanislaus (First Class), with swords.

REAR-ADMIRAL SIR OSMOND DE BEAUVOIR BROCK, K.C.V.O., C.B., C.M.G.


REAR-ADMIRAL SIR OSMOND DE BEAUVOIR BROCK, K.C.V.O., C.B., C.M.G.,
entered the Navy in the early 'eighties of the last century, becoming a
Midshipman on August 15th, 1884. While serving in the "Raleigh" he was
awarded the Royal Humane Society's Testimonial on Vellum for having
jumped overboard at Simon's Bay to the assistance of John Duggan,
stoker.

He was promoted to Lieutenant on February 14th, 1889, having passed the
examination with five First Class Certificates, and later specialised in
Gunnery. He was promoted to Commander on January 1st, 1900, and on
January 1st, 1904, he became a Captain. In 1905 he was Flag Captain to
Lord Charles Beresford, and in November, 1910, was appointed Assistant
Director of Naval Mobilisation. From January 8th, 1912, to August 1st,
1912, he acted as Assistant Director, Mobilisation Division, Admiralty
War Staff.

[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL SIR OSMOND DE B. BROCK]

During the action in Heligoland Bight on August 28th, 1914, Captain
Brock commanded the "Princess Royal," and in the action off the Dogger
Bank, January 24th, 1915, he commanded the same ship. When Sir David
Beatty's flagship "Lion" was damaged he transferred his flag to the
destroyer "Attack," and later the "Princess Royal." For his services
Captain Brock was mentioned in despatches and awarded the C.B. He
commanded a Battle Cruiser Squadron in the Battle of Jutland, was again
mentioned in despatches and awarded the C.M.G. It was on these Battle
Cruiser Squadrons, as Sir John Jellicoe remarked, that the brunt of the
fighting fell, and Sir David Beatty reported the "able support"
rendered him in the battle by their commanders.

He was Aide-de-Camp to the King from October 24th, 1913, to March 5th,
1915, when he became a Rear-Admiral.

REAR-ADMIRAL LIONEL HALSEY, C.B., C.M.G.


REAR-ADMIRAL LIONEL HALSEY, C.B., C.M.G., Third Sea Lord, was born in
1872, and joined H.M.S. "Britannia" in 1885. As a Naval Cadet he served
in the "Agincourt," Flag-ship of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Edmund R.
Fremantle, then second in command of the Channel Squadron. Becoming a
Sub-Lieutenant in 1891, he subsequently served as Lieutenant and
Flag-Lieutenant in several different ships.

During the South African War he took part in the defence of Ladysmith,
where he had charge of the 4.7 gun in Princess Victoria Battery at Cove
Hill Redoubt. He was also executive Officer to Captain Lambton (now
Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux) towards the end of the siege, besides taking
charge of all the Naval guns. For his services in this connection he was
mentioned in despatches.

On January 1st, 1901, he was specially promoted to Commander. In 1912 he
became Captain of the "New Zealand," the first capital ship built at the
charge of a Dominion Government. In the following year Captain Halsey
received the C.M.G. From September, 1914, till he became Rear-Admiral in
April, 1917, he was Aide-de-Camp to the King.

[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL L. HALSEY]

Captain Halsey was mentioned in despatches for his services in the
actions at Heligoland and the Dogger Bank. He became Captain of the
Fleet and Commodore, First Class, in 1915. After the Battle of Jutland,
Admiral Jellicoe wrote as follows:--"My special thanks are due to
Commodore Lionel Halsey, C.M.G., the Captain of the Fleet, who also
assists me in the working of the Fleet at sea, and to whose good
organization is largely due the rapidity with which the Fleet was
fuelled and replenished with ammunition on return to its bases. He was
of much assistance to me during the action."

Commodore Halsey received the C.B. on June 3rd, 1916, becoming Fourth
Sea Lord in December of the same year, and Third Sea Lord in May, 1917.
He is a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and holds the Russian Order
of St. Vladimir (Third Class).

VICE-ADMIRAL SIR WILLIAM C. PAKENHAM, K.C.B., K.C.V.O.


VICE-ADMIRAL SIR WILLIAM CHRISTOPHER PAKENHAM, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., was
born in July, 1861, the second son of the late Rear-Admiral the Hon.
Thomas Alexander Pakenham. In his early days in the Royal Navy he made a
reputation as a swimmer, assisting in the rescue of a seaman who fell
overboard at Larnaca, Cyprus, and some years later endeavouring to save
a man who fell from the foreyard of the "Calypso" during drill at Kiel.
He became a Captain on June 30th, 1903, and from April, 1904, to May,
1906, he was Naval Attache at Tokyo.

He became a C.B. in July, 1905, and received the Order of the Rising Sun
(Second Class) from H.I.M. the Emperor of Japan in 1906. In July, 1907,
when in command of the "Antrim," escorting King Edward to Ireland, he
was awarded the M.V.O.

From December, 1911, to December, 1913, he was a Lord Commissioner of
the Admiralty. In June, 1913, he became Rear-Admiral, and in December
was appointed to command the Third Cruiser Squadron.

Rear-Admiral Pakenham was present at the Battle of Jutland and received
a K.C.B. on May 31st, 1916, for his services on that occasion.

[Illustration: VICE-ADMIRAL SIR WILLIAM PAKENHAM]

When Admiral Sir David Beatty was given the command of the Grand Fleet
in succession to Admiral Sir John Jellicoe in November, 1916, Admiral
Pakenham was selected to assume the command of the Battle Cruiser Force,
and was promoted to Acting Vice-Admiral on June 19th, 1917.

On the occasion of the visit of H.M. King George to the Fleet in July,
1917, Admiral Pakenham was made a K.C.V.O.

Vice-Admiral Pakenham has received the Russian Order of St. Stanislaus
(Second Class), and also an Imperial Gift, graciously conferred by
H.I.M. the Emperor of Japan.

COMMODORE GODFREY M. PAINE, C.B., M.V.O.


COMMODORE GODFREY MARSHALL PAINE, C.B., M.V.O., was born in 1871 and
entered the Navy in 1885, becoming a Lieutenant on August 23rd, 1893,
after service in the Royal Yacht.

On December 31st, 1903, he became a Commander, and was in the "Renown"
during the voyage of the Prince and Princess of Wales to India, October,
1905, to May, 1906. On June 30th, 1907, he became a Captain. From June,
1909, to June, 1911, he commanded the Third Torpedo Boat Destroyer
Flotilla.

From August, 1911, to May, 1912, he was Captain of H.M.S. "Actaeon," the
Torpedo School Ship at Sheerness, then the Headquarters of the infant
Naval Air Service. He gained the pilot's certificate of the Royal Aero
Club in May, 1912, flying a Short biplane, and before the end of the
month became first Commandant of the Central Flying School, Salisbury
Plain.

This School, inaugurated in 1912, was open to both Naval and Military
aviators, and was, in consequence, an institution demanding special
qualifications from the Officer in command. The new experiment proved a
complete success under Captain Paine.

[Illustration: COMMODORE G. M. PAINE]

In 1915 Captain Paine became a Commodore (First Class), and in 1917 he
was appointed Director of Naval Air Service and Fifth Sea Lord. The
skill, versatility and usefulness of the Naval Air Service have rivalled
those of the military airmen. The naval airmen have had to discover
their true role and make their traditions. When their record can be
known the success of Commodore Paine will be fully appreciated. He
received a C.B. on January 1st, 1914. He is also a Commander of the
Legion of Honour.

COMMODORE SIR REGINALD YORKE TYRWHITT, K.C.B., D.S.O.


COMMODORE (First Class) SIR REGINALD YORKE TYRWHITT, K.C.B., D.S.O., was
born in 1870 and entered the "Britannia" as a cadet in 1885, becoming a
Lieutenant on August 25th, 1892.

As Lieutenant of H.M.S. "Cleopatra" in 1894 he was one of a landing
party, composed of seamen and marines, under Lieutenant Colmore, who
went to protect the inhabitants of Bluefields, Nicaragua. This
expedition saved the lives of the inhabitants, who expressed their
gratitude in a letter of thanks.

Having become a Captain on June 30th, 1908, Captain Tyrwhitt commanded
the Second Flotilla from August, 1912, to November, 1913, when he was
appointed Captain of the First Fleet Flotillas and was advanced to the
rank of Commodore (Second Class), in April, 1914.

At the outbreak of war, Commodore Tyrwhitt was in command of the Harwich
Force consisting of the First, Second, and Tenth Flotillas. He took part
in the actions in the Heligoland Bight and off the Dogger Bank and in
many minor actions in 1914-17.

For his services in the action in the Heligoland Bight he was awarded
the C.B. The "London Gazette" stated that his attack was delivered with
great skill and gallantry. Commodore Tyrwhitt also received the thanks
of the Admiralty for the manner in which he lead his forces.

[Illustration: COMMODORE SIR REGINALD Y. TYRWHITT]

In December, 1914, he was advanced to Commodore (First Class). In June,
1916, he received the D.S.O., and in April, 1917, he was appointed
A.D.C. to the King, and for services rendered during the War received
the K.C.B. on July 25th, 1917.

Commodore Tyrwhitt is a Commander of the Legion of Honour and Chevalier
of the Military Order of Savoy.

INTRODUCTION

PART II.


The first thing a landlubber does when he opens his mouth about the sea
or about sea power is to put his foot in it; and therefore one's sense
of decency in approaching this procession of illustrious admirals,
headed by Sir David Beatty, compels one to put oneself in a posture of
reverent trepidation and respectful humility. The man of words in time
of war ought to prostrate himself before the man of action. He ought to
order himself lowly and reverently before and very much below his
betters. In his case judgment or even criticism is an outrageous
impertinence. He knows little about war by land and even less about war
by sea. Any enlargement of his knowledge is only a microscopical
diminution of his ignorance. The sea is a mystery, unveiled only to
those who go down to (or in) the sea in ships.

Sailors tolerate our immeasurable ignorance, for they rejoice in the
sense of humour which the sea seems to enrich and expand. It is many
years since a mischievous midshipman cajoled me into climbing the mast
of H.M.S. "Majestic," then flying the flag of Sir Harry Rawson. Until I
went up in an aeroplane at St. Omer I never drank more deeply of the cup
of terror. That midshipman, for all I know, may now be one of these
grave admirals with smiles lurking at the corners of their eyes and
lips. It is a far cry from the naval manoeuvres of the "'nineties" to
the "real thing" of 1918, but the impulse to hark back to those mimic
battles is irresistible. My first and last misdemeanour was the striking
of a match on the paint of a casemate. The memory of it even now makes
me blush from nape to heel, and warns me that nearly everything a
landlubber may say about the Navy is as the striking of a match on the
wrong place at the wrong time on a Victorian man o' war.

And yet those far-off days in wardroom and gunroom, on navigating bridge
and quarter-deck, helped me to drink the pure milk of the Navy word. No
man who has watched a blinded battle fleet keeping station on a
pitch-black night, or whose head has grown giddy in the mazes of a
cruiser action, or who has seen a destroyer attack pushed home in the
dark, or who has seen the drifters coming in coated with ice, can fail
to feel in his bones the thrill of sea-power. To such a man there comes
at all moments the salt warning, "Put not your trust only in armies. For
England there is but one supreme war-faith, the creed of the sea."

There is no lack of lip-service to the sea-creed in these islands. The
sea-litany and the sea-liturgy and the sea-prayers and the sea-collects
and the sea-psalms and the sea-proverbs are tirelessly chanted and sung
and said by high and low. Line upon line, precept upon precept,
sea-bible and sea-gospel and sea-hymn--we know them all by heart. Our
Newbolts, our Kiplings, our Conrads, our Hurds, our Leylands--yes, and
our Mahans--they are all a great cloud of witnesses to the supreme
necessity of sea-power. And yet in one's lay bones one feels that our
practice falls far short of our preaching, and that we as a race are not
utterly single-minded in our worship of the one power who has never
betrayed us, the sea. The sea is a jealous god, and in these latter days
a sure instinct leads one back to the old faith taught by Nelson and his
forerunners, by the great captains and admirals whose bones are dust.

Peace is a rust that tarnishes a Navy, and, as one studies these
portraits and these all too brief and bare biographies, one wonders
whether "the Nelson touch" is hereditary, and whether these clear-eyed,
strong-lipped admirals are all chips of the old block. One wonders, I
say, and yet one does not doubt, for at every meal we eat the proof of
the pudding. These admirals and their men have kept the faith and held
the sea against High Seas Fleet and mine and submarine. Not for many a
long day will all the wonders they have wrought be known or even
suspected. Few there be who are allowed to peep into the inner shrine of
admiralty. The higher secrets of sea-power are guarded and will be
guarded long after Britain shall have won this war.

Herein is the true explanation of these modest memoirs which tell so
little with all their camouflage of dates and decorations. Compared with
a British admiral, Tacitus was a loquacious and copious blabber and
babbler. If you interrogate him, he smiles and displays a long row of
ribbons or a festoon of foreign orders. "The Silent Navy" is silent
because it is not safe to talk or to be talked about, and also because
it is not in love with the gauds of publicity. I confess I like the
austere reticence of these dull and dreary lifelets of our great
admirals. It warns us that we must walk by faith and not by sight when,
like Peter, we take to the stormy waters.

There is, of course, the doubting Thomas, who is "hot for certainties"
in the sea affair. He whispers in my ear that there is in the higher
ranks a dearth of genius as compared with the lower ranks, and he tries
to support his theory by asserting that all the brilliant junior
officers must pass through a narrow bottle-neck before they become
captains, and that the captains, after ten or twelve years of that awful
solitude which is the captain's pride and peril, are apt to suffer from
the ossifying brain which rejects new ideas, from the crusted
conservatism which resists reform, from deskwork and paperwork, and from
all the ravages of the red tapeworm.

My answer is that the sea is a giant that refreshes itself, and that
your Nelson is proof against his routine, master of his groove. The long
duel with the submarine is in itself evidence of the adaptability of our
seamen. Where we have failed is not on the sea but in the dim region
behind the sea, where the word of the sailor is no longer dominant and
where other forces and factors interlock and interplay. Many and
manifold are the uses of sea-power; many and manifold also are its
abuses. And it is one of the qualities of sea-power that it is
inarticulate, not given to polemics or dialectics or rhetoric or
oratory, a thing of profound instinct and intuition, a product of the
genius of race. Napoleon never understood sea-power as the German
Emperor and Admiral von Tirpitz have learned to understand it, after
much patient poring over the writings of Mahan. In all humility we ought
not to be surprised that some of our own great ones have been and
perhaps still are in the same state of pupilage as Napoleon. But war is
a schoolmaster whose lessons are learned in due time by the most
backward scholars.

There is a music-hall song sung in these stern days by some witless
buffoon, "If you don't want to fight, join the Navy." As if the locker
of Davy Jones were not fat with the valour of our seamen and our
fishermen! In the bitterness of his soul a Super-Dreadnought captain
said to me, "After the war I'll not be able to walk down Piccadilly
without being hissed." These are extravagances of hyperbole, but they
are a reflection of the folly that asks, "What is the Navy doing?" When
I hear that fatuous question I retort, "What on earth and what on the
sea is the Navy not doing?" It is keeping the ring for all the armies of
all the Allies, and it is waiting for the last great sea-fight of
Armageddon, the fight that is bound to come.

"They were dull, weary, eventless months, those months of watching and
waiting of the big ships. Purposeless they surely seemed to many, but
they saved England. Those far distant storm-beaten ships, upon which the
Grand Army never looked, stood between it and the dominion of the
world." A greater army than the Grand Army, led by chieftains hardly
less renowned than Napoleon, is battering, as I write, at the gates of
the Channel Ports. Whatever may befall, we know in our bones that these
admirals of ours and their seamen stand between the Emperor Wilhelm and
his imperial dream of world tyranny. Sir David Beatty sitting in his
deck-chair is a living symbol of sea-power, and the armchair pessimist
may well emulate his nonchalant vigilance, noting the wicked twinkle in
his humorous eye and the sardonic curl of his sailor-mouth.

The Kaiser has chosen to sup with the sea-devil, and he has need of a
very long spoon before he sees his supper, which happens to be our
freedom and the freedom of all free men.

ADMIRAL SIR DAVID BEATTY, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., D.S.O.


ADMIRAL SIR DAVID BEATTY, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., D.S.O., was born on January
17th, 1871, and entered the "Britannia" in January, 1884. He became a
Lieutenant in August, 1892. During the Egyptian War he served on the
Nile in cooperation with the Egyptian Army, under the late Lord
Kitchener. In the course of this campaign he rendered excellent service
in getting gunboats over the Cataract, and, as second in command of the
Flotilla, at the forcing of the Dervish batteries at Hafir under fire.

On Commander Colville being wounded, Lieutenant Beatty took command of
the Flotilla and fought the gunboats in front of the enemy batteries
with great persistence and success, eventually dismounting their guns.
For these services he was awarded the D.S.O. and mentioned in
despatches.

He was also mentioned in despatches by the Sirdar for service with the
gunboats employed during the Soudan operations on the Nile in 1898,
which included the capture of Berber and the battles of Atbara and
Khartoum. He subsequently accompanied Lord Kitchener in the advance to
Fashoda, and was present at his meeting with Major Marchand. After the
capture of Khartoum he was specially promoted to Commander.

When the Boxer outbreak occurred Admiral Beatty was Commander in the
"Barfleur," second flagship on the China Station, and served in the
Tientsin Concession throughout the siege. He showed exceptional tenacity
in attempting with 200 bluejackets to capture two Chinese guns which
were causing great trouble to the forces and inhabitants; after being
twice wounded he continued to lead his men to the attack. He afterwards
commanded the British Naval Brigade of the international force which
relieved Admiral Seymour's expedition from a critical situation in
Hsikon Arsenal. Later he commanded the Naval Brigade at the capture of
Tientsin City. For these services he was specially promoted to the rank
of Captain at the early age of 29, in 1900.

[Illustration: ADMIRAL SIR DAVID BEATTY]

From November, 1908, to January 1st, 1910, Captain Beatty was
Aide-de-Camp to the King.

On January 1st, 1910, although not 39 years old, he became Rear-Admiral,
and two years later was appointed Naval Secretary to the First Lord of
the Admiralty, a post which he held until February, 1913. During the
Naval Manoeuvres of 1912, Rear-Admiral Beatty commanded the Sixth
Cruiser Squadron, flying his flag in H.M.S. "Aboukir."

In the following year he was appointed to command the First Battle
Cruiser Squadron. In June, 1914, he was made a K.C.B., and on August 3rd
was promoted Acting Vice-Admiral and given command of the Cruiser Forces
of the Grand Fleet.

On August 28th, 1914, he was in command of the British Forces which
proceeded into the Heligoland Bight in support of a Flotilla of

VI

REAR-ADMIRAL FREDERICK CHARLES TUDOR TUDOR, C.B.


REAR-ADMIRAL FREDERICK CHARLES TUDOR TUDOR, C.B., is especially well
known for his thorough knowledge of the limitations and capabilities of
ordnance as applied to the strategical and tactical problems of modern
warfare. In this particular line indeed he is an expert of undisputed
authority where knowledge, besides being fortified by mental attainments
of an unusually brilliant kind, is based upon a profound study of the
science of gunnery, in which, it should be added, Rear-Admiral Tudor
specialized during the early part of his career.

Navigation was originally the particular branch of naval knowledge to
which the Admiralty directed him to devote himself, but early realising
the immense part which heavy artillery was to play in modern warfare,
Admiral Tudor, as a young man, eventually devoted his entire attention
to the study of guns and gunnery. At no time in the history of armaments
has such an important development of power, of rapidity of firing and of
reliability of guns of all calibre, been known, and this being so,
Officers like Rear-Admiral Tudor, who are experts in such matters, are
absolutely invaluable to the British Navy.

From the very beginning of his career Rear-Admiral Tudor was recognised
as an Officer possessing intelligence of a very high order.

From 1892 for two years he acted as Experimental Officer, and for a
further two years as a Senior Staff Officer of H.M.S. "Excellent,"
passing to the Department of the Director of Naval Ordnance at the
Admiralty in January, 1896, where he remained until May, 1898. In 1902
he became a Captain, and from September, 1906, to May, 1909, he was
Assistant Director of Naval Ordnance.

[Illustration: VICE-ADMIRAL SIR F. C. T. TUDOR]

As Captain of the "Excellent," to which ship he was appointed in August,
1910, Rear-Admiral Tudor did much to promote that proficiency in gunnery
which is so vitally essential to the success of all modern naval
operations. He held the post for nearly two years, and during that
period impressed everyone who came in contact with him with the firm
idea that he was the right man in the right place.

From April 12th, 1911, to January 14th, 1913, he was Aide-de-Camp to the
King, on which latter date he was promoted to Rear-Admiral.

On June 12th, 1912, Rear-Admiral Tudor was appointed Director of Naval
Ordnance, and on King George's birthday in 1913 he received the C.B.

He was Third Sea Lord on the Board of Admiralty from August 11th, 1914,
to May 31st, 1917, being mainly responsible for new construction during
this period of immense expansion of the Fleet under war conditions.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
