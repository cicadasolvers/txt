DANIEL DE FOE AND HIS GHOST STORIES.

I feel obliged by your intelligent correspondent "D.S." having
ascertained that De Foe was the author of the _Tour through Great
Britain_. Perhaps he may also be enabled to throw some light on a
subject of much curiosity connected with De Foe, that appears to me well
worth the inquiry.

Mrs. Bray, in her General Preface prefixed to the first volume of the
reprint, in series, of her _Novels and Romances_, when giving an account
of the circumstances on which she founded her very graphic and
interesting romance of _Trelawny of Trelawne_, says--

     "In Gilbert's _History of Cornwall_, I saw a brief but striking
     account, written by a Doctor Ruddell, a clergyman of Launceston,
     respecting a ghost which (in the year 1665) he has seen and laid to
     rest, that in the first instance had haunted a poor lad, the son of
     a Mr. Bligh, in his way to school, in a place called the 'Higher
     Broom Field.' This grave relation showed, I thought, the credulity
     of the times in which the author of it lived; and so I determined
     to have doctor, boy, and ghost in my story. But whereas, in the
     worthy divine's account of the transaction, the ghost appears to
     come on earth for no purpose whatever (unless it be to frighten the
     poor boy), I resolved to give the spirit something to do in such
     _post-mortem_ visitations, and that the object of them should be of
     import to the tale. Accordingly I made boy, doctor, and the woman
     (who is said after her death to have appeared to the lad) into
     characters, invented a story for them, and gave them adventures."

Mrs. Bray adds--

     "Soon after the publication of _Trelawny_, my much esteemed friend,
     the Rev. F.V.T. Arundell[1], informed me, that, whilst engaged in
     his antiquarian researches in Cornwall, he found among some old and
     original papers the manuscript account, in Dr. Ruddell's own
     hand-writing, of his encounter with the ghost in question. This he
     lent Gilbert, who inserted it in his _History of Cornwall_; and
     there I first saw it, as stated above. A few months ago, I
     purchased some of the reprinted volumes of the _Works of Daniel De
     Foe_. Among these was the _Life of Mr. Duncan Campbell_, a
     fortune-teller. To my great surprise, I found inserted in the
     Appendix (after verses to Mr. Duncan Campbell), without either name
     of the author, reference, or introduction, under the heading, 'A
     remarkable Passage of an Apparition, 1665,' no other than Dr.
     Ruddell's account of meeting the ghost which had haunted the boy,
     so much the same as that I had read in Gilbert, that it scarcely
     seemed to differ from it in a word. The name of Mr. Bligh, the
     father of the boy, was, however, omitted; and Dr. Ruddell could
     only be known as the author of the account by the lad's father
     calling the narrator Mr. Ruddell, in their discourse about the
     youth. The account is so strangely inserted in the Appendix to the
     volume, without comment or reference, that, had I not previously
     known the circumstances above names by Mr. Arundell, I should have
     fancied it a fiction of De Foe himself, like the story {242} of
     the ghost of Mrs. Veal, prefixed to _Drelincourt on Death_.

     "Aware that Mr. Arundell had no idea that Ruddell's ghost story was
     to be found in any work previous to Gilbert's, I lost no time in
     communicating to that gentleman what I could not but deem a very
     curious discovery. He assured me there could be no mistake as to
     the genuineness of the ghost document he had found, as he had
     compared the manuscript with Ruddell's hand-writing in other
     papers, and saw it was one and the same. Soon after, Mr. Arundell
     favoured me with some further information on the subject, which I
     here give, as it adds still more to the interest of the
     story:--'Looking into Gilbert's _History of Cornwall_, in the
     parish of South Petherwin, there is said to be in the old mansion
     of Botathan five portraits of the Bligh family; one of them is the
     likeness of the boy, whose intimacy with the ghost of Dorothy
     Durant has been spoken of in his first volume, where she is
     erroneously called Dingley. If this be a fact, it is very
     interesting; for it is strange that both Mr. Ruddell, the narrator
     (whose manuscript I lent to Gilbert), and De Foe, should have
     called her Dingley. I have no doubt it was a fictitious name, for I
     never heard of it Launceston or the neighbourhood; whereas Durant
     is the name of an ancient Cornish family: and I remember a tall,
     respectable man of that name in Launceston, who died at a very
     advanced age; very probably a connexion of the Ghost Lady. He must
     have been born about 1730. Durant was probably too respectable a
     name to be published, and hence the fictitious one.' Mr. Arundell
     likewise says, 'In Launceston Church is a monument to Charles Bligh
     and Judith his wife, who died, one in 1716, and the other in 1717.
     He is said to have been sixty years old, and was probably the
     brother of Samuel, the hero of Dorothy Dingley. Sarah, the wife of
     the Rev. John Ruddell, died in 1667. Mr. Ruddell was Vicar of
     Aternon in 1684. He was the minister of Launceston in 1665, when he
     saw the ghost who haunted the boy.'"

Such is Mrs. Bray's account of these very curious circumstances. The
ghost story inserted in Gilbert, as mentioned above, is altogether so
much in the style of De Foe, that a doubt remains whether, after all, he
may not have been the author of it. Can "D.S.," or any of your readers,
throw further light on the subject?

     Asia Minor_, and the well-known _Visit to the Seven Churches of

PET-NAMES.

"Mary" is informed that "Polly" is one of those "hypocorisms," or
pet-names, in which our language abounds. Most are mere abbreviations,
as Will, Nat, Pat, Bell, &c., taken usually from the beginning,
sometimes from the end of the name. The ending _y_ or _ie_ is often
added, as a more endearing form: as Annie, Willy, Amy, Charlie, &c. Many
have letter-changes, most of which imitate the pronunciation of infants.
_L_ is lisped for _r_. A central consonant is doubled. _O_ between _m_
and _l_ is more easily sounded than _a_. An infant forms _p_ with its
lips sooner than _m_; papa before mamma. The order of change is: Mary,
Maly, Mally, Molly, Polly. Let me illustrate this; _l_ for _r_ appears
in Sally, Dolly, Hal _P_ for _m_ in Patty, Peggy; vowel-change in Harry,
Jim, Meg, Kitty, &c; and in several of these the double consonant. To
pursue the subject: re-duplication is used; as in Nannie, Nell, Dandie;
and (by substitution) in Bob. Ded would be of ill omen; therefore we
have, for Edward, Ned or Ted, _n_ and _t_ being coheir to _d_; for Rick,
Dick, perhaps on account of the final _d_ in Richard. Letters are
dropped for softness: as Fanny for Franny, Bab for Barb, Wat for Walt.
Maud is Norman for Mald, from Mathild, as Bauduin for Baldwin. Argidius
becomes Giles, our nursery friend Gill, who accompanied Jack in his
disastrous expedition "up the hill." Elizabeth gives birth to Elspeth,
Eliza (Eloisa?), Lisa, Lizzie, Bet, Betty, Betsy, Bessie, Bess;
Alexander (_x_=_cs_) to Allick and Sandie. What are we to say of Jack
for John? It seems to be from Jacques, which is the French for our
James? How came the confusion? I do not remember to have met with the
name James in early English history; and it seems to have reached us
from Scotland. Perhaps, as Jean and Jaques were among the commonest
French names, John came into use as a baptismal name, and Jaques or Jack
entered by its side as a familiar term. But this is a mere guess; and I
solicit further information. John answers to the German Johann or
Jehann, the Sclavonic Ivan, the Italian Giovanni (all these languages
using a strengthening consonant to begin the second syllable): the
French Jean, the Spanish Juan, James to the German Jacob, the Italian
Giacomo, the French Jacques, the Spanish Jago. It is observable that of
these, James and Giacomo alone have the _m_. Is James derived from
Giacomo? How came the name into Scotland?

Of German pet-names some are formed by abbreviation; some also add _s_,
as Fritz for Frieds from Friedrich, Hanns for Hann from Johann. (To this
answers our _s_ or _c_ in the forms Betsy, Nancy, Elsie, &c.) Some take
_chen_ (our _kin_, as _mannikin_) as Franschen, Hannchen. Thus Catskin
in the nursery ballad which appears in Mr. Halliwell's Collection, is a
corruption of Kaetchen Kitty. Most of our softened words are due to the
smooth-tongued Normans. The harsh Saxon Schrobbesbyrigschire, or
Shropshire, was by them softened into le Comte de Salop, and both names
are still used.

LACEDAEMONIAN BLACK BROTH.

If your readers are not already as much disgusted with Spartan Black
Broth as Dionysius was {243} with the first mouthful, I beg leave to
submit a few supplementary words to the copious indications of your
correspondents "R.O." and "W."

Selden says:--

     "It was an excellent question of Lady Cotton, when Sir Robert
     Cotton was magnifying of a shoe, which was Moses's or Noah's, and
     wondering at the strange shape and fashion of it: 'But, Mr.
     Cotton,' says she, '_are you sure it is a shoe?_'"

Now, from the following passage in Manso's _Sparta_, it would seem that
a similar question might be put on the present occasion: _Are you sure
that it was broth?_ Speaking of the _pheiditia_, Manso says:--

     "Each person at table had as much barley-bread as he could eat;
     swine's-flesh, or some other meat, to eat with it, with which the
     famous black-sauce[2] (whose composition, without any loss to
     culinary art, is evidently a mystery for us) was given round, and
     to close the meal, olives, figs, and cheese."

In a note he continues:--

     "Some imagined that the receipt of its composition was to be found
     in Plutarch (_De Tuenda Sanitate_, t. vi. p. 487.), but apparently
     it was only imagination. That [Greek: zomos] signified not broth,
     as it has been usually translated, but _sauce_, is apparent from
     the connection in which Athenaeus used the word. To judge from
     Hesychius, it appears to have borne the name [Greek: bapha] among
     the Spartans. How little it pleased the Sicilian Dionysius is well
     known from Plutarch (_Inst. Lacon._ t. v. 880.) and from others."

Sir Walter Trevelyan's question is soon answered, for I presume the
celebrity of Spartan Black Broth is chiefly owing to the anecdote of
Dionysius related by Plutarch, in his very popular and amusing _Laconic
Apophthegms_, which Stobaeus and Cicero evidently followed; this, and
what is to be gathered from Athenaeus and Julius Pollux, with a few words
in Hesychius and the _Etymologicon Magnum_, is the whole amount of our
information. Writers since the revival of letters have mostly copied
each other, from Coelius Rhodiginus down to Gesner, who derives his
conjecture from Turnebus, whose notion is derived from Julius
Pollux,--and so we move in a circle. We sadly want a Greek Apicius, and
then we might resolve the knotty question. I fear we must give up the
notion of cuttle-fish stewed in their own ink, though some former
travellers have not spoken so favourable of this Greek dish. Apicius,
_De Arte Coquinaria_, among his fish-sauces has three Alexandrian
receipts, one of which will give some notion of the incongruous
materials admissible in the Greek kitchen of later times:--

     "JUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO.

     "Piper, cepam siccam, ligusticum, cuminum, orignum, apii semen,
     pruna damascena enucleata; passum, liquamen, defrutum, oleum, et
     coques."

This question Vexata it seems had not escaped the notice of German
antiquaries. In Boettiger's _Kleine Shriften_, vol. iii., Sillig has
printed for the first time a Dissertation, in answer to a question which
might have graced your pages: "Wherewith did the Ancients spoon" [their
food]? Which opens thus:--

     "Though about the composition and preparation of Spartan Black
     Sauce we may have only so many doubts, yet still it remains certain
     that it was a _jus_--boiled flesh prepared with pig's blood, salt,
     and vinegar, a _brodo_; and, when it was to a certain degree
     thickened by boiling, though not like a _Polenta_ or other
     dough-like mass (_maza offa_), eaten with the fingers. Here, then,
     arises a gastronomic question, of importance in archaeology; what
     table furniture or implements did the Spartans make use of to carry
     this sauce to their months? A spoon, or some substitute for a
     spoon, must have been at hand in order to be able to enjoy this
     Schwarzsauer."

It is certain at least that spoons and forks were unknown to the
Spartans, and some have conjectured that a shell, and even an egg-shell,
may have served the purpose. Those who are desirous of knowing more
about the Table-Supellectile of the ancients, may consult Casaubon's
_Notes on Athenaeus_, iv. 13. p. 241.; "Barufaldo de Armis
Convivialibus," in Sallengre's _Thesaurus_, iii. 741.: or Boettiger's
_Dissertation_ above referred to. How little ground the passage in
Plutarch, _De Sanitate Tuenda_, afforded for the composition will appear
from the passage, which I subjoin, having found some difficulty in
referring to it:

     [Greek: Oi Lakones uxos kai halas dontes to mageiro, ta loipa
     keleuouso en to iereio setein.]

This only expresses the simplicity of Spartan cookery in general.

To revert to the original question propounded, however, I think we must
come to the conclusion that _coffee_ formed no part of the [Greek: melas
zomos.]

A HINT TO INTENDING EDITORS.

Allow me to suggest, as an addition to the sphere of usefulness of the
"NOTES AND QUERIES," that persons preparing new editions of old writers
should give an early intimation of the work on which they are engaged to
the public, through your paper. Very many miscellaneous readers are in
the habit of making notes in the margins of their books, without any
intention of using them themselves for publication, and would be glad to
give the benefit of them to any body to whom they would be welcome; but
as matters are now arranged, one has no opportunity of hearing of an
intended new edition until it is advertised as being in the press, when
it is probably too late to send notes or suggestions; and one is also
deterred from communicating with the editor from doubts {244} whether
he will not think it an intrusion: doubts which any editor who _did_
wish for communications might dispel by making such an announcement as I
have suggested.

NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HAND-BOOK OF LONDON.

_St. Giles's Pound_.--The exact site of this Pound, which occupied a
space of thirty feet, was the broad space where St. Giles's High Street,
Tottenham Court Road, and Oxford Street meet. The vicinity of this spot
was proverbial for its profligacy; thus in an old song:--

    "At Newgate steps Jack Chance was found,
    And bred up near _St. Giles's Pound_."

_Dudley Court, St. Giles's_.--This spot was once the residence of Alice
Duchess of Dudley, in the reign of Charles the Second; and afterwards of
the celebrated Lord Wharton. The mansion and gardens were of
considerable extent.

_St. Giles's Hospital_.--The celebrated Dr. Andrew Boorde rented for
many years the Master's house. He is mentioned as its occupant in the
deed of transfer between Lord Lisle to Sir Wymonde Carewe, dated in the
last year of Henry the Eighth's reign.

_Gray's Inn Lane_.--Anciently called _Portpoole_. See the commission
granted to the Master of the Hospital of St. Giles's, &c. to levy tolls
upon all cattle, merchandize, &c., dated 1346, in Rymer's _Foedera_.

_Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn_.--Lord Herbert of Cherbury was one
of the first inhabitants of this street, residing at the south side,
near the east corner of Wild (or more properly _Weld_) Street, where he
died in 1648. The house is still standing, and is one of fifteen built
in the third year of James the First. _Powlet_ and _Conway_ houses, also
still standing, are among the said number. The celebrated Dr. Mead (D.
1754) resided in this street.

_Turnstile Lane, Holborn_.--Richard Pendrell, the preserver of Charles
the Second, resided here in 1668. It is supposed that Pendrell, after
the Restoration, followed the king to town, and settled in the parish of
St. Giles, as being near the court. Certain it is that one of Pendrell's
name occurs in 1702 as overseer, which leads to the conclusion that
Richard's descendants continued in the same locality for many years. A
great-granddaughter of this Richard was living in 1818 in the
neighbourhood of Covent Garden. Richard Pendrell died in 1674, and had a
monument erected to his memory on the south-east side of the old church
of St. Giles. The raising of the churchyard, subsequently, had so far
buried the monument as to render it necessary to form a new one to
preserve the memory of this celebrated man. The black marble slab of the
old tomb at present forms the base of the new one.

EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.


_Mrs. Cornelly's_ is stated, in vol. ii. p. 753., _to be_ "the corner of
Sutton Street," Soho Square, "_now D'Almaines's_." Mrs. Cornelly's _was_
at the corner of Sutton Street, but has long been pulled down: the
Catholic chapel _in_ Sutton Street was Mrs. Cornelly's concert, ball,
and masquerade-room; and the arched entrance below the chapel, and now a
wheelwright's, was the entrance for "chairs." D'Almaine's is two doors
north of Sutton Street, and was built by Earl (?) Tilney, the builder of
Wanstead House? The House in Soho Square has a very fine
banqueting-room, the ceiling said to have been painted by Angelica
Kauffmann. Tilney was fond of giving magnificent dinners, and here was
always to be found "the flesh of beeves, with Turkie and other small
Larks!"

_Cock Lane_.--The house in Cock Lane famous for its "Ghost" _is still_
standing, and the back room, where "scratching Fanny" lay surrounded by
princes and peers, is converted into a gas meter manufactory.

FOLK LORE.

_Easter Eggs_.--The custom of presenting eggs at Easter is too well
known to need description; but perhaps few are aware that, like many
other customs of the early Church, it had its origin in paganism.

Sir R.K. Porter (_Travels_, vol. i. p. 316.) mentions that at a period
of the year corresponding to Easter, "the Feast of nooroose, or of the
waters," is held, and seems to have had its origin prior to
Mahometanism. It lasts for _six_ days, and is supposed to be kept in
commemoration of the Creation and the Deluge--events constantly
synchronised and confounded in pagan cosmogonies. At this feast eggs are
presented to friends, in obvious allusion to the Mundane egg, for which
Ormuzd and Ahriman were to contend till the consummation of all things.

When the many identities which existed between Druidism and Magianism
are considered, we can hardly doubt that this Persian commemoration of
the Creation originated our Easter-eggs.

G.J.


_Buns_.--It has been suggested by Bryant, though, I believe, not noticed
by any writer on popular customs, that the Good Friday cakes, called
_Buns_, may have originated in the cakes used in idolatrous worship, and
impressed with the figure of an ox, whence they were called [Greek:
boun]. The cow or bull was likewise, as Coleridge (_Lit. Rem_. vol. ii.
p. 252.) has justly remarked, the {245} symbol of the _Cosmos_, the
prolific or generative powers of nature.

G.J.


_Gloucestershire Custom_.--It is a custom in Gloucestershire, and may be
so in other counties, to place loose _straw_ before the door of any man
who beats his wife. Is this a general custom?--and if so, what is its
origin and meaning?

B.


_Curious Custom_.--The custom spoken of by "PWCCA" (No. 11 p. 173.) was
also commonly practised in one or two places in Lancashire some ten or
twelve years back, but is now, I believe, obsolete. The horse was played
in a similar way, but the performer was then called "Old Balls." It is
no doubt a vestige of the old "hobby-horse,"--as the Norwich "Snap," who
kept his place in the procession of the mayor of that good city till the
days of municipal reform, was the last representative of his companion

QUERIES.

WHITE HART INN, SCOLE.

In _Songs and other Poems_, by Alex. Brome, Gent. Lond. 12mo. 1661,
there is (at p. 123.) a ballad upon a sign-post set up by one Mr. Pecke,
at Skoale in Norfolk. It appears from this ballad, that the sign in
question had figures of Bacchus, Diana, Justice, and Prudence, "a fellow
that's small, with a quadrant discerning the wind," Temperance,
Fortitude, Time, Charon and Cerberus. This sign is noticed in the
_Journal_ of Mr. E. Browne (Sir Thomas Browne's Works, ed. Wilkin, i.
53.). Under date of 4th March, 1663-64, he says:--"About three mile
further I came to Scoale, where is very handsome inne, and the noblest
sighne post in England, about and upon which are carved a great many
stories, as of Charon and Cerberus, of Actaeon and Diana, and many other;
the sighne it self is the white harte, which hangs downe carved in a
stately wreath." Blomefield, in his _History of Norfolk_ (8vo. edit. i.
130.), speaking of Osmundestone or Scole, has the following passage:--

     "Here are two very good inns for the entertainment of travellers;
     the _White Hart_ is much noted in these parts, being called, by way
     of distinction, _Scole Inn_; the house is a large brick building,
     adorned with imagery and carved work in several places, as big as
     the life. It was built in 1655, by _John Peck_, Esq., whose arms
     impaling his wife's, are over the porch door. The sign is very
     large, beautified all over with a great number of images of large
     stature carved in wood, and was the work of one _Fairchild_; the
     arms about it are those of the chief towns and gentlemen in the
     county, viz. _Norwich, Yarmouth, Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Yarmouth,
     Bacon of Garboldisham, Hobart, Conwaleis_, impaling _Bukton, Teye,
     Thurston, Castleton_, and many others; _Peck's_ arms are _arg_. on
     a chevron ingrailed, _gul_. three croslets pattee of the field; his
     wife's are _arg_., a fess between two crescents in chief, a lion
     rampant in base _gul_., which coat I think is borne by the name of
     _Jetheston_. Here was lately a very round large bed, big enough to
     hold fifteen or twenty couple, in imitation (I suppose) of the
     remarkable great bed at _Ware_. The house was in all things
     accommodated, at first, for large business; but the road not
     supporting it, it is in much decay at present; though there is a
     good bowling-green and a pretty large garden, with land sufficient
     for passengers' horses. The business of these two inns is much
     supported by the annual cock-matches that are here fought."

In Cruttwell's _Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain_ (Lond.
12mo. 1801), vol. v. 208., is the following:--

     "Osmondeston, or Schole. The inn here was once remarkable for a
     pompous sign, with ridiculous ornaments, and is said to have cost a
     thousand pounds; long since decayed."

I shall be glad to be referred to any other notices of this sign, and am
desirous of knowing if any drawing or engraving of it be extant.

PASSAGES FROM POPE.

In addition to the query of "P.C.S.S." (No. 13. p. 201.), in which I
take great interest, I would beg leave to ask what evidence there is
that Quarles had a _pension?_ He had, indeed, a small _place_ in the
household of James the First's queen, Anne; and if he had a _pension_ on
her death, it would have been from James, not from Charles.

I would also, in reference to Pope, beg leave to propound another query.

In the "Imitation of the 2nd Sat. Book I. of Horace," only to be found
in modern editions, but attributed, I fear, too justly to Pope, there is
an allusion to "poor E----s," who suffered by "_the fatal steel_," for
an intrigue with a royal mistress. E----s is no doubt _John Ellis_, and
the royal mistress the _Duchess of Cleveland_. (See Lord Dover's
Introduction to the "Ellis Correspondence," and "Anecdotes of the Ellis
Family," _Gent. Mag_. 1769. p. 328.) But I cannot discover any trace of
the circumstances alluded to by Pope. Yet Ellis was a considerable man
in his day;--he had been Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in
the reign of Charles II., and was Under-Secretary of State under William
III.; he is said to have afterwards sunk into the humbler character
{246} of a "London magistrate," and to have "died in 1788, at 93 or 95,
immensely rich." I should be glad of any clue to Pope's allusion.

_Essay on Man_, Epistle IV. 203.

Will your correspondent "P.C.S.S." (No. 13), evidently a critical reader
of Pope, and probably rich in the possession of various editions of his
works, kindly inform me whether any commentator on the poet has traced
the well-known lines that I have quoted to the "Corcillum est, quod
homines facit, caetera quisquilia omnia" of Petronius Arbiter, cap. 75.?
Pope had certainly both read and admired the _Satyricon_, for he
says:--

    "Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,
    The scholar's learning with the courtier's ease."

_Essay on Criticism_, sect. 3

I find no note on the lines either in the edition of Warton, 9 vols.
8vo., London, 1797, or in Cary's royal 8vo., London, 1839; but the
similarity strikes me as curious, and deserving further examination.

BELVOIR CASTLE.

In Nichol's _History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester_, vol.
ii., part i., containing the Framland Hundred, p. 45 of the folio ed.
1795, occurs the following quotation, in reference to the rebuilding of
Belvoir castle by Henry, second Earl of Rutland, in 1555:--

     "That part of the more ancient building, which was left by both
     unaltered, is included in the following concise description by an
     ingenious writer, who visited it in 1722:--

        'AEdes in culmine montis sitae, scilicet,
                                [Greek: aipeia kolonen

The description goes on for a few more lines; but it matters not to
continue them. I should be much obliged by any of your readers giving an

founded the foregoing observations, as it is a subject of much interest

MINOR QUERIES.

_MSS. formerly belonging to Dr. Hugh Todd_.--I shall feel most grateful
to any of your correspondents who can afford me any information, however
imperfect, respecting the MSS. of Dr. Hugh Todd, Vicar of Penrith, and
Prebendary of Carlisle, in the beginning of the last century. In the
_Cat. MSS. Angliae_, &c., 1697, is a catalogue of nineteen MSS, then in
his possession, five of which are especially the subject of the present
inquiry. One is a Chartulary of the Abbey of Fountains, in 4to; another
is an Act Book of the Consistory Court of York, in the fifteenth
century, in folio; the third is the Chapter Book of the Collegiate
Church of Ripon, from 1452 to 1506; the fourth contains Extracts and
Manuscripts from Records relating to the Church of Ripon; and the last
is apparently a Book of the Acts of the Benefactors to that foundation.
In a letter to Humphrey Lawley, dated in 1713, Dr. Todd says he was
engaged in a work relating to the province of York, and the greater part
of the MSS. in the catalogue above mentioned appear to have been
collected as the materials.

       And falling lost his crown,

         When countries round
         With fear profound,
     To help their sad condition,
         And lands to save,
         Base homage gave,
     Bold Kent made no submission."

_Curious Monumental Brass_.--I have a rubbing of a Brass, presenting

The Brass, from which the rubbing is taken (and which was formerly in
the Abbey church of St. Albans, but when I saw it was detached and lying
at the Rectory), is broken off a little below the waist; it represents
an abbot, or bishop, clad in an ornamented chasuble, tunic, stole, and
alb, with a maniple and pastoral staff. So far all is plain; but at the
back (i.e. on the surface hidden when the Brass lay upon the floor) is
engraved a dog with a collar and bells, apparently as carefully executed
as any other part. Can you tell me the meaning of this? I can find no
mention of the subject either in Boutell or any other authority. The
fragment is about 18 inches long, and the dog about 6, more or less.

_Bishop Blaize_.--I should be much obliged by any reference to

Sebaste, in Armenia, the proximity of which place to Colchis appears to
me suspicious. Wonderful and horrible tales are told of him; but I
suspect his patronage of wool-combers is founded on much more ancient
legends. His establishment at Agrigentum must have been previous to
Christianity. I have a vague remembrance of some mention of him in
Higgins's _Anacalypsis_, but I have not now access to that work. I wish
some learned person would do for other countries what Blunt has partly

bearing the initials of the Protector upon them; and, further, that a
large barn, which Oliver built there, was still standing, and went by
the name of Cromwell's Barn; and that the farmer then renting the farm
occupied by the Protector circa 1630-36, marked his sheep with the
identical marking-irons which Oliver used, and which had O.C. upon them.

    For if she will, she will you may depend on't,
    And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't."

I have heard these lines confidently attributed to Shakspeare, Byron,
&c. by persons unable to verify the quotation, when challenged so to do.
I can point out where the first two lines may be found with some
variation. In _The Adventures of Five Hours_, a comedy translated from
the Spanish of Calderon, by Samuel Tuke, and {248} printed in the 12th
volume of Dodsley's _Old Plays_ (edit. 1827), in the 5th act (p. 113.),
the lines run thus:--

    "He is a fool, who thinks by force or skill
     To turn the current of a woman's will."

I should be glad if any one could inform me by whom the latter lines
were added, and where they may be found in print.

REPLIES.

AELFRIC'S COLLOQUY, AND THE A.-S. WORD AEGYPE IN THE A.-S. PSALTER.

In reference to MR. THORPE'S note (No. 15. p. 232.), I beg leave, with
all possible respect and deference, to suggest that his joke is not
quite _ad rem_.--What would do for a _beefsteak_ does not help his
_mistake_; for it is quite evident that _sprote_ applies to
fish-_swimming_ and not to fish-_catching_; and I presume that "useful
and sagacious" auxiliary, Dr. Kitchener himself, would hardly have
ventured to deny that _fish_ may _swim quickly_?

Now let us try how MR. THORPE'S proposed _salice=wicker_, or _sallow_,
with or without the _basket_, will suit the context. The fisherman is
asked, "Quales pisces capias? = What fish do you take?" The answer is
Anguillos &c. &c. et qualescunque in amne natant salu = Eels &c. &c.,
and every sort whatever that in water swimmeth [wicker/sallow] basket!
Let it be remembered that the question here is not, "_How_ dost thou
take fish?" which had been put and _answered before_, but "_What_ fish
dost thou take?" and then let common sense decide; for the fisherman
having already mentioned that he cast _nets_ and _hooks_, and
[_spyrian_/spartas], i.e. _baskets_, now only replies as to the _fish_
he takes.

MR. THORPE calls the A.-S. dialogue a _Gloss_; is it not rather an
_interlineary version_? like those in use, in later times, of Corderius,
and used for the same purpose.

I have no doubt that upon more mature consideration MR. THORPE will see
that it could not be a substantive that was intended; and, as he admits
my conjecture to be _specious_, that he will, in the course of his very
useful labours, ultimately find it not only specious but correct.
Meanwhile, I submit to his consideration, that beside the analogy of the
Gothic _sprauto_, we have in Icelandic _spretta_, imperf. _spratt_,
"subito movere, repente salire, emicare;" and _sprettr_, "cursus
citatus," and I do think these analogies warrant my conclusion.

I embrace this opportunity of submitting another _conjecture_ respecting
a word in MR. THORPE'S edition of the _Anglo-Saxon Paraphrase of the
Psalms_. It occurs in Ps. cvi. ver. 10., "Quid exacerbaverunt eloquium
Domini," &c., which is rendered: "Forthon hidydan Drihtnes spraece aegwaes
_aegype_." In a note MR. THORPE says: "_aegype_, non intelligo," and gives
a reason for deeming the passage corrupt. To me it seems to express the
generally accepted sense of _exacerbaverunt_: and here a cognate
language will show us the way. Icelandic _geip_, futilis exaggeratio;
_atgeipa_, exaggerare, effutire: _aegype_, then, means to _mock_, to
_deride_, and is allied to _gabban_, to gibe, to jape. In the Psalter
published by Spelman it is rendered: hi _gremedon_ spraece godes. In
Notker it is _widersprachen_, and in the two old Teutonic interlinear
version of the Psalms, published by Graff, _verbitterten_ and
_gebittert_. Let us hear our own interesting old satirist, Piers
Plouhman [Whitaker's ed. p. 365.]:

     And God wol nat be gyled, quoth Gobelyn, ne be _japed_.

But I cease, lest your readers should exclaim, Res non verba. When I
have more leisure for _word-catching_, should you have space, I may
furnish a few more.

S.W. SINGER.

Feb. 11. 1850.


_AElfric's Colloquy_.--I have my doubts whether MR. SINGER'S ingenious
suggestions for explaining the mysterious word _sprote_ can be
sustained. The Latin sentence appears clearly to end with the word
_natant_, as is not only the case in the St. John's MS., mentioned in
MR. THORPE'S note, but in fact, also in the Cottonian MS. There is a
point after _natant_, and then follows the word _Saliu_ (not _salu_)
with a capital _S_. Any person who examines the handwriting of this MS.
will see that the word, whatever the transcriber may have understood by
it, was intended by him to stand alone. He must, however, have written
it without knowing what it meant; and then comes the difficulty of
explaining how it got into the MS. from which he copied. It has always
appeared to me probable that the name of some fish, having been first
interlined, was afterwards inserted at random in the text, and mis-spelt
by a transcriber who did not know its meaning. A word of common
occurrence he would have been less likely to mistake. Can _saliu_ be a
mistake for _salar_, and _sprote_ the Anglo-Saxon form of the
corresponding modern word _sprod_, i.e. the salmon of the second year?
The _salar_ is mentioned by Ausonius in describing the river Moselle and
its products (_Idyll_. 10, l. 128.). {249}

    "Teque inter species geminas neutrumque et utrumque,
     Qui necdum salmo, nec jam salar, ambiguusque
     Amborum medio fario intercepte sub aevo."

I throw out this conjecture to take its chance of refutation or
acceptance. Valeat quantum!

ANTONY ALSOP.

"R.H." (No. 14, p. 215.) will find all, I believe, that is known
respecting Antony Alsop, in that rich storehouse of materials for the
literary history of the last century, Nichols's _Anecdotes_, or in
Chalmers (_Biog. Dict._), who has merely transcribed from it. The volume
of _Latin Odes_ your correspondent mentions, was published by Sir
Francis Bernard, and printed by Bowyer. Some notice of Sir Francis
Bernard will also be found in Nichols.

The _Odes_ were long circulated in MS.; and I have a copy that once
belonged to Thomas Warton, which seems to have been written by G.
Crochly, of Christchurch College, in 1736. It contains, however, nothing
that is not to be found in the printed volume. The Dedication to the
Duke of Newcastle was written by Bernard, who had intended to have given
a preface and copious notes, as appears by the prospectus he published:
but, to our great regret, he was dissuaded from his purpose.

Alsop was a favourite with that worthy man and elegant scholar Dean
Aldrich, at whose instance he published his pleasing little volume,
_Fabularum AEsopicarum Delectus_, Oxon. 1698. In the preface Bentley is
thus designated--"Richardum quendam Bentleium Virum in volvendis Lexicus
satis diligentem:" and there is a severe attack upon him in one of the
fables, which was not forgotten by the great scholar, who affects to
speak of Tony Alsop the fabulist with great contempt.

I have never seen the volume of _Latin and English Poems_ published in
1738; but, notwithstanding the designation, "a gentleman of Trinity
College," it may be at least partly by Alsop, though he undoubtedly was
of Christchurch. There are English poems by him, published both in
Dodsley's and Pearch's collection, and several in the early volumes of
the _Gentleman's Magazine_. I have the authority of a competent judge
for saying, that the very witty, but not quite decent verses in that
miscellany, vol. v. p. 216--"Ad Hypodidasculum quendam plagosum, alterum
orbilium, ut uxorem duceret, Epistola hortativa." Subscribed "Kent,
Lady-day, 1835"--are Alsop's. He took the degree of M.A. in 1696, and of
B.D. in 1706, and, by favour of the Bishop of Winchester, got a prebend
in his cathedral, and the rectory of Brightwell, Berks. He was
accidentally drowned in a ditch leading to his garden gate, in 1726.
There is good reason to believe that a MS. life of him is to be found
among the Rawlinson MSS., which it may be worth while to consult.

It will be remembered that Christchurch was the head-quarters of the
phalanx of wits opposed to Bentley.

    "Nor wert thou, Isis, wanting to the day,
     [Tho' Christchurch long kept prudishly away,"]

is Pope's ironical banter; and he has not failed to mention Alsop and
Freind in Bentley's speech:--

    "Let Freind affect to speak as Terence spoke,
     And Alsop never but like Horace joke,"

where the note says, "Dr. Antony Alsop, a happy imitator of the Horatian
style."

Indeed, Alsop seems to have been duly esteemed and appreciated by his
contemporaries; and every tasteful scholar will concur in the opinion
that his truly elegant Sapphics deserve a place among the few volumes of
modern Latin verse, which he would place near Cowper's more extensively
known favourite, Vinny Bourne.

S.W.S.


Antony Alsop, respecting whom a query appears in No. 14. p. 215., was of
Christchurch, under the famous Dr. Aldrich, by whom the practice of
smoking was so much enjoyed and encouraged. The celebrated Sapphic ode,
addressed by Alsop to Sir John Dolben, professes to have been written
with a pipe in his mouth:--

    "Dum tubum, ut mos est meus, ore versans,
     Martiis pensans quid agam calendas,
     Pone stat Sappho monitisque miscet
                      Blanda severis."

Ant. Alsop took his degree of M.A. March 23. 1696, B.D. Dec. 1706. He
died June 10, 1726; and the following notice of his death appears in the
_Historical Register_ for that year:--

"Dy'd Mr. Antony Alsop, Prebendary of Winchester, and Rector of
Brightwell, in the county of Berks. He was killed by falling into a
ditch that led to his garden door, the path being narrow, and part of it
foundering under his feet."

I believe Alsop was not the author of a volume by a gentleman of Trinity
College, and that he never was a member of that society; but that doubt
is easily removed by reference to the entry of his matriculation at
Oxford.

"R.H." inquires, whether Antony Alsop was at Trinity College before he
became a student of Christchurch? I have considered it to be my duty to
examine the Admission Registers of Trinity College in my possession
since the foundation of the college; and I can only say, that I do not
find the name in any of them. That he was at Christchurch, and admitted
there as a student, is recorded by his biographers. It is also {250}
said, that he was elected at once from Westminster to Christchurch,
where he took the degree of M.A. March 23. 1696, and that of B.D. Dec.
12. 1706. He was soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich as worthy of his
patronage and encouragement. He was consequently appointed tutor and
censor, and in course of time left college, on his promotion to a
prebendal stall in Winchesser Cathedral by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, the
then Bishop, with the rectory of Brightwell, near Wallingford; at which
latter place he chiefly resided till the time of his death, which
happened by an accident, June 10. 1726. Sir Francis Bernard, Bart., who
had himself been a student of Christchurch, published the 4to. volume of
_Latin Odes_ mentioned by "R.H.," Lond. 1753; for which he had issued
_Proposals_, &c., so early as July, 1748. In addition to these _Odes_,
four English poems by Alsop are said to be in Dodsley's collection, one
in Pearch's, several in the early volumes of the _Gentleman's Magazine_,
and some in _The Student_. Dr. Bentley calls him, rather familiarly,
"Tony Alsop, editor of the _AEsopian Fables_;" a work published by him at
Oxford, in 1698, 8 vo., in the preface to which he took part against Dr.
Bentley, in the dispute with Mr. Boyle.

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.


_Origin of the Word "Snob"_.--I think that _Snob_ is not an archaism,
and that it cannot be found in any book printed fifty years ago. I am
aware that in the north of England shoe-makers are still sometimes
called _Snobs_; but the word is not in Brockett's _Glossary of North
Country Words_, which is against its being a genuine bit of northern
dialect.

I fancy that _Snobs_ and _Nobs_, as used in vulgar parlance, are of
classic derivation; and, most probably, originated at one of the
Universities, where they still flourish. If a _Nob_ be one who is
_nobilis_, a _Snob_ must be one who is _s[ine] nob[ilitate]_. Not that I
mean to say that the _s_ is literally a contraction of _sine_; but that,
as in the word slang, the _s_, which is there prefixed to _language_, at
once destroys the better word, and degrades its meaning; and as, in
Italian, an _s_ prefixed to a primitive word has a privative
effect--e.g. _calzare_, "to put on shoes and stockings;" _scalzare_, "to
put them off:" _fornito_, "furnished;" _sfornito_, "unfurnished," &c.;
as also the _dis_, in Latin (from which, possibly, the aforesaid _s_ is
derived), has the like reversing power, as shown in _continue_ and
_discontinue_--so _nob_, which is an abbreviation of _nobilis_, at once
receives the most ignoble signification on having an _s_ put before it.

The word _Scamp_, meaning literally a fugitive from the field, one _qui
ex campo exit_, affords another example of the power of the initial _s_
to reverse the signification of a word.

All this, Mr. Editor, is only conjecture, in reply to "ALPHA's" query
(No. 12 p. 185.); but perhaps you will receive it, if no better
etymology of the word be offered.

_Derivation(?) of "Snob" and "Cad."_--I am informed by my son, who goeth
to a Latin school, that _Snob_ (which is a word he often useth) cometh
of two Latin words; to wit, "_sine obolo_"--as who should say, "one that
hath not a cross to bless himself." He saith, that the man behind the
omnibus is called "_Cad_," "_a non cadendo_." Your humble servant,

_Sir Stephen Fox._--I have seen it stated in some biographical
dictionary, that Sir Stephen Fox was a younger brother of "John Fox,
Esq.," who was a devoted Royalist at the time of the great Rebellion,
and fought at the battle of Worcester, {251} and after the Restoration
was Clerk of the Acatry, in the household of Charles the Second.

Mr. Suckling, in his _History of Suffolk_, claims for a family some time
seated at Stradbrook, in that county, a consanguinity with the
descendants of Sir Stephen.

On an altar-tomb in Stadbrook churchyard are inscribed notices of many
members of this family, but without dates. One is rather extraordinary,
making the lives of a father and son together to amount to 194 years.
Amongst them is this:--

     "Here is hourly expected, Simon the next descendant, with his son
     Simon, who died young, tho' still preserved to be interr'd with his
     father at the earnest request of his pious mother the Lady Hart.
     And also Major John Fox, with his issue, who during the late
     rebellion loyally behav'd himself, undergoing with great courage
     not only the danger of the field, but many severe imprisonments."

The arms on this tomb differ from those of Lords Ilchester and Holland,
being simply three foxes' heads erased.

Should this note supply a clue for your correspondent "VULPES" to
identify Major John Fox with the brother of Sir Stephen, on knowing that
he has found the scent I shall be able to assist him in unearthing the
whole litter.

_French Maxim_.--The maxim inquired after by "R.V." (No. 14. p. 215.)

_Shipster_.--A _scip-steora_ among our Anglo-Saxon ancestors was a pilot
("_ship-steerer_"). The word has descended to our own times in the
surname of the family Shipster. As a common noun it was not obsolete in
the days of Wynkyn de Worde, who printed that curious production "_Cock
Lorelle's Bote_," one line of which runs thus:--

     "With gogle-eyed Tomson, _shepster_ of Lyn."

It is pretty certain, however, that this masculine occupation was not
the one followed by "Marie Fraunceys de Suthwerk!"

Pray accept this "Reply" for what it is worth. Perhaps I might have done
better by meeting Mr. John R. Fox's "Query" (No. 14. p. 216.) with
another. Should not the designation of Marie F. be _Spinster_ instead of
Shipster?

_Sparse_.--Permit me to refer your correspondent "C. FORBES" for a reply
to his query, p. 215. of your last Number, to the article "Americanism"
in the _Penny Cyclopaedia_, the author of which observes:--

     "_Sparse_ is, for any thing we know, a new word, and well applied;
     the Americans say a _sparse_ instead of a scattered population; and
     we think the term has a more precise meaning than scattered, and is
     the proper correlative of _dense_."

In the _Imperial Dictionary_ (avowedly based upon Webster's American
work, which I cannot at this moment refer to in its original form), the
word in question is given both as an adjective and as a verb, and the
derivatives "sparsed," "sparsedly," "sparsely," and "sparseness," are
also admitted. The reference given for the origin of "sparse" is to the
Latin "_sparsus_, scattered, from _spargo_;" and the definitions are, 1.
"Thinly scattered, set or planted here and there; as, a _sparse_
population:" and, 2., as a botanical term, "not opposite, not alternate,
nor in any regular order; applied to branches, leaves, peduncles, &c."

_Cosmopolis--Complutensian Polyglot_.--Though in considerable haste, I
must send replies to the fourth and eighth queries of my friend Mr.
Jebb, No. 14. p. 213.

_Cosmopolis_ was certainly Amsterdam. That the _Interpretationes
paradoxae quatuor Evangeliorum_, by Christophorus Christophori Sandius,
were there printed, appears from this writer's _Bibliotheca
Anti-Trinitarionum_, p. 169., Freistad, 1684. I may add that "Coloniae"
signifies "Amstelaedami" in the title-page of Sandius's _Nucleus Historiae
Ecclesiasticae_, 1676, and in the _Appendix Addendorum_, 1678, 4to.

With regard to the MSS. used in the formation of the text of the
_Complutensian Polyglot_, Mr. Jebb will find an account of their
discovery in a letter addressed by Dr. James Thompson to the editor of
_The Biblical Review_. See also _The Irish Ecclesiastical Journal_ for
April 1847.

_Complutensian Polyglot_.--The following extract from "The Prospectus of
a Critical Edition of the New Testament," by the learned Mr. S. Prideaux
Tregelles, affords a satisfactory reply to Mr. Jebb's query, No. 14. p.
212.:--

     "However there is now more certainty as to the MSS. belonging to
     the University of Alcala. Dr. James Thompson has published
     (_Biblical Review_, March, 1847), the result of inquiries made
     thirty years ago by Dr. Bowring, and more recently by himself.
     Hence it appears that all the MSS. which formerly were known as
     belonging to Cardinal Ximenes, and which were preserved in the
     library of Alcala, are now with the rest of that library, at
     Madrid....Dr. Jose Gutierrez, the present librarian at Madrid,
     communicated to Dr. J. Thomson a catalogue of the Complutensian
     MSS., and from this it appears that the principal MSS. used in the
     Polyglott are all safely preserved."

_Christmas Hymn._--Your correspondent "E.V." (No. 13. p. 201.) asks for
the author of the Christmas Hymn--

     "Hark! the Herald Angels sing."

I believe it to be the composition of the Rev. Charles Wesley, the
younger brother of the celebrated John Wesley: he was born in 1708, and
died in 1788. He was the author of many of the hymns in his brother's
collection, which are distinguished for their elegance and simplicity. I
am not able to find out, for certain, whether he had another name; if he
had, it was probably the occasion of the initials (J.C.W.) your
correspondent mentions.

_Sir Jeffery Wyattville._--Sir Jeffery Wyattville, respecting whom
"J.P." inquires (No. 14. p. 215.), was knighted at Windsor Castle, Dec.
9, 1828., on the king entering into possession after the restoration.

S.G.

[To which may be added, on the information of our valued correspondent
"C.," "that it was about 1824 that Mr. Wyatt, being appointed by George
IV. to conduct the improvements at Windsor Castle, had the absurd
ambition of distinguishing himself from the other architects of his name
by changing it to _Wyattville_. This produced the following epigram in,
I think, the _Morning Chronicle_:--

    "'Let GEORGE whose restlessness leaves nothing quiet,
      Change, if he will, the good old name of _Wyatt_;
      But let us hope that their united skill
      May not make _Windsor Castle--Wyattsville!_'"]


_"Peruse."_--In reply to the question of "H.W." (No. 14. p. 215.),
although from want of minute reference I have been unable to find, in
the original edition, the quotation from Frith's works, I beg leave to
suggest that the word "Peruse" is a misprint, and that the true reading
is "Pervise." To this day the first examination at Oxford, commonly
called the "Little-Go," is "Responsiones in _Parviso_." It must not,
however, be supposed that "Pervise," or "Parvise," is derived from the
Latin "Parvus;" the origin, according to Spelman and succeeding
etymologists, is the French "Le Parvis," a church porch.

In London the Parvis was frequented by serjeants at law: see Chaucer,
_Prol. Cant. Tales_. There is a difference of opinion where it was
situated: see Tyrwhitt's _Gloss_. The student in ecclesiastical history
may compare _Leo Allatius de Templis Graecorum_, p. 44.

T.J.


_Autograph Mottoes of Richard Duke of Gloucester and Harry Duke of
Buckingham_. (No. 9. p. 138.)--There can be no doubt that "Mr. NICOLS"
is somewhat wrong in his interpretation of the Duke of Buckingham's
Motto. It is evident that both mottoes are to be read continuously, and
that "souene" is the third person singular of a verb having "loyaulte"
for its nominative case. It appears to me that the true reading of the
word is "soutienne," and that the meaning of the motto is "My feelings
of loyalty often sustain me in my duty to the King when I am tempted to
join those who bear no good feeling towards him." So that we shall have
in English,

    Loyalty binds me}
    Richard Gloucester.}

    Often sustains me}

_Boduc._--Your correspondent "P." (No. 12, p. 185.) seems to consider
the "prevailing opinion," that _Boduc_ or _Boduoc_ on the British coin
must be intended for our magnanimous Queen Boadicea, to be merely a
"pleasing vision," over which he is "_sorry_ to cast a cloud." Yet his
own remark, that the name Budic (a mere difference in spelling) is often
found among families of the Welsh in Brittany, and that the name was
once common in England, serves only to confirm the common opinion that
_Boduoc_ on the coins was intended as the name of the British Queen.

Dio expressly writes her name in Greek Boudouica, which approaches
nearly to Budic. In Cornwall we still find Budock, the name of a parish
and of a saint. In Oxford there was a church formerly called from St.
Budoc, long since destroyed. Leland mentions a Mr. Budok, and his manor
place, and S. Budok Church. His opinion was, that "this Budocus was an
Irisch man, and cam into Cornewalle, and ther dwellid." Whether there
was a Regulus of Britain of this name, is not material. I am not
prepared to cast a cloud over it, if it should be found. Our motto
should be, "ex fumo dare lucem," &c.

_Annus Trabeationis_.--I am sure that you will allow me to correct an

attributed to Du Cange a sentence in the Benedictine addition to his
explanation of the term _Trabeatio_. (_Glossar_. tom. vi. col. 1158.
Venet. 1740.) This word certainly signifies the Incarnation of Christ,
an not his Crucifixion. Besides the occurrence of "trabea carnis
indutus," at the commencement of a sermon on S. Stephen by S. Fulgentius
Ruspensis, I have just now met with the expressions, "trabea carnis
velatus," and "carnis trabea amicti," in a copy of the _editio princeps_
of the Latin version of Damascen's books in defence of Image-worship, by
Godefridus Tilmannus, fol. 30 b. 39 a, 4to. Paris, 1555.

    But who, and what is the pursuer,
    A Jesuit cursing Popery:
    A railer preaching charity;
    A reptile, nameless and unknown,
    Sprung from the slime of Warburton,
    Whose mingled learning, pride, and blundering,
    Make wise men stare, and set fools wondering."

_Doctor Dobbs and his Horse Nobbs_.--I remember having read somewhere of
"Doctor Dobbs and his horse Nobbs," but where I cannot now recall. I
only remember one anecdote. The horse Nobbs was left, one cold night,
outside a cottage, whilst the Doctor was within officiating as
accoucheur (I believe); when he was ready to start, and came out, he
found the horse apparently dead. The Doctor was miles from home, and, as
the horse was dead, and the night dark, in place of walking home, he,
with his host, dragged the horse into the kitchen, and skinned him, by
way of passing the time profitably. But, lo! when the skinning was
finished, the horse gave signs of returning animation. What was to be
done? Doctor Dobbs, fertile in resources, got sheepskins and sewed them
on Nobbs, and completely clothed him therein; and--mirabile dictu!--the
skins became attached to the flesh, Nobbs recovered, and from
thenceforward carried a _woolly_ coat, duly shorn every summer, to the
profit of Doctor Dobbs, and to the wonder and admiration of the
neighbourhood.

I have also read somewhere that Coleridge told the story of "Doctor
Dobbs and his horse Nobbs" to Southey at Oxford.

J.M.B.


_Dr. Dobbs and his Horse Nobbs_.--Although of small moment, it is,
perhaps, worth recording, that a Doctor Daniel Dove, of Doncaster, and
his horse Nobbs, form the subjects of a paper in "The Nonpareil, or the
Quintessence of Wit and Humour," published in 1757, and which, there can
be little doubt, was the source whence Southey adopted, _without
alteration_, the names so well known to all readers of the _Doctor_.

_St. Evona's Choice._--To your citation of Ben Jonson's exceptional case
of the Justice Randall as "a lawyer an honest man," in justice add the
name of the learned and elegant author of _Eunomus_; for Mr. Wynne
himself tells the story of St. Evona's choice (Dialogue II. p. 62. 3rd
ed. Dublin, 1791), giving his authority in the following note:--

     "The story here dressed up is told in substance in a small book
     published in 1691, called a _Description of the Netherlands_," p.
     58.

In strict law, Sir, the profession may in courts of Momus be held bound
by the act of the respectable but unlucky St. Evona; but in equity, let
me respectfully claim release, for Evona was a _churchman_.

A TEMPLAR.

[We gladly insert our correspondent's "claim to release," but doubt
whether he can establish it; inasmuch as St. Ivo or Evona, canonized on
account of his great rectitude and profound knowledge both of civil and
canon law, was both lawyer and churchman, like the CLERICUS so recently
discussed in our columns; and clearly sought for and obtained his patron
saint in his legal character.]


_Muffins and Crumpets, &c._--Not being quite satisfied with the
etymology of "muffin," in p. 205., though brought by Urquhart from
Phoenicia and the Pillars of Hercules, I am desirous of seeking
additional illustration. Some fancy that "coffee" was known to Athenaeus,
and that he saw it _clearly_ in the "black broth" of the Lacedaemonian
youth. In the same agreeable manner we are referred to that instructive
and entertaining writer for the corresponding luxury of "muffins."
_Maphula_, we are told, was one of those kinds of bread named as such by
Athenaeus; that is to say, "a cake baked on a hearth or griddle." If we
need go so far, why not fetch our muffins from Memphis, which is _Moph_
in Hebrew? (See _Hosea_, ix. 6.) It is, perhaps, _mou-pain_, in old
French, _soft bread_, easily converted into _mouffin_. So "crumpet" may
be a corruption of _crumpate_ a paste made of fine flour, slightly
baked. The only difficulty would then be in the {254} first syllable,
concerning, which the ingenuity of your various correspondents, Mr.
Editor, may be exercised to some effect. Is it connected with the use of
the _crimping_ irons in producing these delicacies?

HYPOMAGIRUS.

_Dulcarnon_.--Dulcarnon is one of those words in Chaucer which Tyrwhitt
professes that he does not understand. It occurs in _Trolius and
Creseide_, book iii. 931.933. Creseide says:--

    "I am, til God me better minde sende,
    At _Dulcarnon_, right at my witt'is ende.
      Quod Pandarus ye nece, wol ye here,
    _Dulcarnon_ clepid is fleming[3] of wretches."

This passage of _Trolius and Creseide_ is quoted in the life of Sir
Thomas More, given in Wordsworth's _Ecclesiastical Biography_. More's
daughter said to him, when he was in prison, "Father, I can no further
goe; I am come, as Chaucer said of Cressid Dulcarnon, to my witt's end."

Has this passage been satisfactorily explained since Tyrwhitt's time?
The epithet "Dulcarnon" is mentioned in a note to the translation of
Richard de Bury's _Philobiblon_, London, 1832. I give the note in full.
It is in reference to the word "Ellefuga":--

     "This word was a pons asinorum to some good Grecians,--but that is
     probably its meaning[4]; at least making it the name of a problem
     gets over all difficulty. The allusion is to the flight of Helle,
     who turned giddy in taking a flying leap, mounted on a ram, and
     fell into the sea;--so weak a head fails in crossing the pons. The
     problem was invented by Pythagoras, 'and it hath been called by
     barbarous writers of the latter time Dulcarnon,'--_Billingsley_.
     This name may have been invented after our author's time. Query
     [Greek: dolkarenon]."

If we take the words "Dulcarnon" in this sense, it will help to explain
the passage in the _Troilus and Creseide_.

_Bishop Barnaby_.--The origin of the term "Bishop Barnaby," as applied
to the Lady-bird, is still unexplained.

I wish to observe, as having some possible connexion with the subject,
that the word "Barnaby" in the seventeenth century appears to have had a
particular political signification.

For instance, I send you a pamphlet (which you are welcome to, if you
will accept of it) called "_The Head of Nile, or the Turnings and
Windings of the Factious since Sixty, in a dialogue between Whigg and
Barnaby_," London, 1681. In this dialog, Whigg, as might be expected, is
the exponent of all manner of abominable opinions, whilst Barnaby is
represented as the supporter of orthodoxy.

Again, in the same year was published Durfey's comedy, "_Sir Barnaby
Whigg_," the union of the two names indicating that the knight's
opinions were entirely regulated by his interest.

Q.D.

P.S. The pamphlet above alluded to affords another instance of the use
of the word "Factotum," at page 41.: "before the Pope had a great house
there, and became Dominus Factotum, Dominus Deus noster Papu."


_Barnacles_.--In _Speculum Mundi, or a Glass representing the Face of
the World_, by John Swan, M.A., 4th edit., 1670, is the following
mention of the Barnacle goose (pp. 243, 244.):--

     "In the north parts of _Scotland_, and in the places adjacent,
     called _Orchades_, are certain trees found, whereon there groweth a
     certain kind of shell-fish, of a white colour, but somewhat tending
     to a russet; wherein are contained little living creatures. For in
     time of maturity the shells do open, and out of them by little and
     little grow those living creatures; which falling into the water
     when they drop out of their shells, do become fowls, such as we
     call _Barnacles_ or _Brant Geese_; but the other that fall upon the
     land, perish and come to nothing."

The author then quotes the passage from Gerard where mention is made of
the Barnacle.

_Ancient Alms-Dishes_.--I have one of these dishes; diameter 1 foot
4-3/4 inches, and its height 1-1/2 inch. The centre is plain, without
any device, and separated from the circle of inscription by a bold
embossed pattern.

The inscription is _Der infrid gehwart_, in raised (not engraved)
capital letters, 1 inch long, repeated three times in the circle. Mine
is a handsome dish of mixed metal; yielding, when struck, a fine sound
like that of a gong. It has devices of leaves, &c. engraved on the broad
margin, but no date.

I have seen another such dish, in the collection of the late William
Hooper, Esq., of Ross, part of which (and I think the whole of the under
side) had been enamelled, as part of the enamel still adhered to it. In
the centre was engraved the temptation in Eden; but it was without
legend or date.

P.H.F.


_Why the American Aborigines are called Indians_.--I have often
wondered how the aborigines of America came to be called Indians; and
for a considerable time I presumed it to be a popular appellation
arising from their dark colour. Lately, however, I fell in with a copy
of _Theatrum Orbis Terrarum_. Antwerp, 1583, by Abraham Ortelius,
geographer to the king; and, in the map entitled _Typus Orbis Terrarum_.
I find America called _America, sive India Nova_. How it came to get
{255} the name of _India Nova_ is of course another question, and one
which at present I cannot answer.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

The arrangements for the _Exhibition of Works of Ancient and Mediaeval
Art_ at the rooms of the Society of Arts in the Adelphi, are proceeding
most satisfactorily. Her MAJESTY and PRINCE ALBERT have manifested the
interest they feel in its success, by placing at the disposal of the
Committee for the purposes of the approaching Exhibition a selection
from the magnificent collection of such objects which is preserved at
Windsor.

Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, of 191. Piccadilly, will sell on Thursday
next, and five following days, the extensive and valuable Library of a
well known and eminent Collector; comprising some very early printed
books of extreme rarity, numerous French, Spanish, and Italian early
Romances, an extensive series of ancient Italian Books quoted by the
_Academia della Crusea,_ ancient and modern Books of Travels, and
Oriental Books and MSS.; amongst which latter are the original MSS. of
the celebrated M. Jules de Klaproth.

We have received the following Catalogues:--

     "A Catalogue of Scientific and Mathematical Books, comprising
     Architecture, Astrology, Magic, Chess, and other Games; Fine Arts,
     Heraldry, Naval and Military, Numismatics, Penmanship and Short
     Hand, Typography, and Miscellaneous Books now selling at the
     reduced prices affixed by William Brown, 130. and 131. Old Street,
     St. Luke's, London."

     "Catalogue (Part I. Feb. 1. 1850) of Choise, Useful and Curious
     Books in most departments of Literature, on Sale, at the very low
     prices affixed, by John Russell Smith, 4, Old Compton Street, Soho
     Square."

     "William Dobson Reeves' Catalogue of Books (Many Rare and Curious),
     now on Sale at 98. Chancery Lane."

     "Catalogue of very Cheap Books, chiefly Divinity, with a Selection
     of Miscellaneous Literature, on Sale, for Ready Money, by T.
     Arthur, No. 496. New Oxford street."

     "A Catalogue of Fathers of the Church, and Ecclesiastical Writers
     to the Fifteenth Century, arranged in Chronological Order, with
     Collections, Analyses and Selections, Illustrative and Introductory
     Works, and an Alphabetical Index of Authors; on Sale at the Low
     Prices affixed, for Ready Money, by C.J. Stewart, 11. King William
     Street, West Strand."

We had occasion in a former Number (No. 5. p. 78) to speak in terms of
high and deserved praise of Mr. Stewart's "Catalogue of Bibles and
Biblical Literature;" the present is no less deserving of commendation,
in as much as it gives not only the Fathers and Ecclesiastical Writers
in Chronological order, according to Centuries (to each of which, by the
way, Mr. Stewart affixes its distinctive character, Apostolic, Gnostic,
&c., as given by Cave); but also marking the precise period in which
they severally flourished, so as to show their succession in each
century. So that this Catalogue, with its Index, and its tempting
quotations from Cranmer and Bishop Hall, which we regret we have not
room to quote, will really be most useful to all Students of Theology
and Ecclesiastical History.

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

We are again compelled, by want of space, to omit many Articles that are
in type; among others, one by Mr. Hampson, on _King Alfred's Geography
of Europe_; _Extracts from Accounts of St. Antholin's_, The Rev. Dr.
Todd _On the Etymology of Armagh_; as well as many NOTES, QUERIES, and
REPLIES; and our acknowledgments of COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED. We are for
the same reason under the necessity of abridging our usual weekly NOTES
ON BOOKS, &c.

R.M. JONES, Chesea. To the queries of this correspondent (No. 14. p.
217.), who inquired for the best Treatise on the Microscope, and where
to purchase the most perfect instrument, we have received many replies,
all agreeing in one point--namely, that Mr. Queckett's is the best work
on the subject--but differing mostly as to who is the best maker. Mr.
Jones is recommended to join the Microscopical Society, 21. Regent
Street, where he will see some of the best-constructed and most valuable
microscopes ever made; and then can make his choice.

To correspondents inquiring as to the mode of procuring "_NOTES AND
QUERIES_," we have once more to explain, that every bookseller and
newsman will supply it regularly _if ordered_; and that gentlemen
residing in the country, who may find a difficulty in getting it through
any bookseller in their neighbourhood, may be supplied regularly with
the _stamped_ edition, by giving their orders direct to the publisher,
Mr. GEORGE BELL., 186. Fleet Street, accompanied by a Post Office order,

THE CHORAL RESPONSES AND LITANIES OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND
IRELAND. Collected from Authentic Sources. By the Rev. JOHN JEBB, A.M.,
Rector of Peterstow.

The present Work contains a full collection of the harmonized
compositions of ancient date, including nine sets of pieces and
responses and thirteen litanies, with a few of the more ancient Psalm
Chants. They are given in full score, and in their proper cliffs. In the
upper part, however, the treble is substituted for the "cantus" or
"medius" cliff: and the whole work is so arranged as to suit the library
of the musical student, and to be fit for use in the Choir.

MEMOIRS OF MUSICK. By the Hon. ROGER NORTH, Attorney General to James I.
Now first printed from the original MS., and edited with copious Notes,
by EDWARD F. RIMBAULT, LL.D., F.S.A., &c. &c. Quarto; with a Portrait;
handsomely printed in 4to.; half-bound in morocco, 15s.

This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney in the
course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed at the disposal
of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society, by George Townshend
Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral. But the Council, not
feeling authorised to commence a series of literary publications, yet
impressed with the value of the work, have suggested its independent
publication to their Secretary, Dr. Rimbault, under whose editorial care
it accordingly appears.

It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek Fables
respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of Musical
Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our present
fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's Opera, &c.

A limited number having been printed, few copies remain for sale; unsold
copies will shortly be raised in price to 1L. 11s. 6d.

The above COMMITTEE has been formed for the purpose of organizing an
EXHIBITION OF WORKS OF ANCIENT AND MEDIAEVAL ART. The SOCIETY OF ARTS
having considered that such an Exhibition is not only likely to be
interesting to the public, but also to be especially useful to
Manufacturers (with reference to the Exhibition of Works of Industry of
all Nations to be held in the year 1851), have placed a portion of their
Rooms at the disposal of the Committee, and have agreed to adopt the
Exhibition as part of that annually made by the Society, thereby taking
all the expenses connected with it upon themselves. The Committee,
regarding the Exhibition in the twofold character contemplated by the
Society of Arts, have resolved that the objects of ancient and mediaeval
art of which the Exhibition is to be composed, shall, as far as
possible, be selected with reference to their beauty and the practical
illustration which they are likely to afford of processes of
manufacture; and now beg to invite the possessors of Works deemed
suitable for such an exhibition to assist the Committee in their very
important office, by entering into communication with them, respecting
the nature of any objects which they may be willing to offer for
exhibition.

It is requested that all Works proposed for exhibition be punctually
sent to the Rooms of the SOCIETY OF ARTS, John Street, Adelphi, on or
before the 20th of February, it being imperative that the Exhibition
should open early in March.

Letters and Communications should be addressed to AUGUSTUS W. FRANKS,
Esq. Honorary Secretary of the Committee, Society of Arts, John Street,
Adelphi.

By order of the Committee,

AUGUSTUS W. FRANKS.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
