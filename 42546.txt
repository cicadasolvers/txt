  VOLUME III.

And now the climax comes not with tongue-lolling sheep-fleece wolves,
ears on top remorselessly pricked for slaughter of the bleating imitated
lamb, here a fang pointing to nethermost pit not of stomach but of
Acheron, tail waving in derision of wool-bearers whom the double-rowed
desiring mouth soon shall grip, food for mamma-wolf and baby-wolf,
papa-wolf looking on, licking chaps expectant of what shall remain; and
up goes the clamour of flocks over the country-side, and up goes howling
of shepherds shamefully tricked by AEsop-fable artifice or doggish
dereliction of primary duty; for a watch has been set through which the
wolf-enemy broke paws on the prowl; and the King feels this, and the
Government, a slab-faced jubber-mubber of contending punies,
party-voters to the front, conscience lagging how far behind no man can
tell, and the country forgotten, a lout dragging his chaw-bacon hobnails
like a flask-fed snail housed safely, he thinks, in unbreakable shell
soon to be broken, and no man's fault, while the slow country sinks to
the enemy, ships bursting, guns jammed, and a dull shadow of defeat on a
war-office drifting to the tide-way of unimagined back-stops on a lumpy
cricket-field of national interests. But this was a climax revealed to
the world. The Earl was deaf to it. Lady CHARLOTTE dumbed it
surprisingly. Change the spelling, put a for u and n for b in the
dumbed, and you have the way MORSFIELD mouthed it, and MATEY swimming
with BROWNY full in the Harwich tide; head under heels up down they go
in Old Ocean, a glutton of such embraces, lapping softly on a pair of
white ducks tar-stained that very morning and no mistake.

"I have you fast!" cried MATEY.

"Two and two's four," said BROWNY. She slipped. "_Are_ four," corrected
he, a tutor at all times, boys and girls taken in and done for, and no
change given at the turnstiles.

"Catch as catch can," was her next word. Plop went a wave full in the
rosy mouth. "Where's the catch of this?" stuttered the man.

"A pun, a pun!" bellowed the lady. "But not by four-in-hand from
London."

She had him there. He smiled a blue acquiescence. So they landed, and
the die was cast, ducks changed, and the goose-pair braving it in dry
clothes by the kitchen fire. There was nothing else to be done; for the
answer confessed to a dislike of immersions two at a time, and the hair
clammy with salt like cottage-bacon on a breakfast-table.

Lord ORMONT sat with the jewels seized from the debating, unbeaten
sister's grasp.

"She is at Marlow," he opined.

"Was," put in Lady CHARLOTTE.

The answer blew him for memory.

"MORSFIELD's dead," his lordship ventured; "jobbed by a foil with button
off."

"And a good job too."

Lady CHARLOTTE was ever on the crest-wave of the moment's humour. He
snicked a back-stroke to the limits, shaking the sparse hair of
repentance to the wind of her jest. But the unabashed one continued.

"I'll not call on her."

"You shall," said he.

"Shan't," was her lightning-parry.

"You shall," he persisted.

"Never. Her head is a water-flower that speaks at ease in the open sea.
How call on a woman with a head like that?"

The shock struck him fair and square.

"We wait," he said, and the conflict closed with advantage to the
petticoat.

A footman bore a letter. His step was of the footman order, calves
stuffed to a longed-for bulbousness, food for donkeys if any such should
chance: he presented it.

"I wait," he murmured.

"Whence and whither comes it?"

"Postmark may tell."

"Best open it," said the cavalry general, ever on the dash for open
country where squadrons may deploy right shoulders up, serre-files in
rear, and a hideous clatter of serjeant-majors spread over all. He
opened it. It was AMINTA's letter. She announced a French leave-taking.
The footman still stood. Lord ORMONT broke the silence.

"Go and be----" the words quivered into completion, supply the blank who
will.

But her punishment was certain. For it must be thus. Never a lady left
her wedded husband, but she must needs find herself weighted with charge
of his grand-nephew. Cuckoo-tutor sits in General's nest, General's wife
to bear him company, and lo! the General brings a grand-nephew to the
supplanter, convinced of nobility beyond petty conventions of
divorce-court rigmarole. So the world wags wilful to the offshoot,
lawn-mowers grating, grass flying, and perspiring gardener slow in his
shirt-sleeves primed with hope of beer that shall line his lean ribs at
supper-time, nine o'clock is it, or eight--parishes vary, and a wife at
home has rules. A year later he wrote--

start a Parliament.

_Step Four._--Having got a Parliament, the nation establishes school
boards, railways, stockbrokers, and penny ices.

_Step Five._--Having become fairly civilised, the nation takes up art
and commerce.

_Step Six._--Having realised considerable wealth, the nation purchases
any amount of ironclads, heavy ordnance, and ammunition.

_Step Seven._--Having the means within reach, the nation indulges in a
terrific war.

_Step Eight and Last._--Having lost everything, the nation returns with
a sigh of relief to old-fashioned barbarism.

  EASTWARD HO!

  "Oh East is East, and West is West," says strenuous RUDYARD KIPLING,
  And what has the West taught to the East,
    save the science of war, and tippling?
  To ram, and to torpedo, and to drain Drink's poisoned flagons?
  And Civilisation sees her work in--armour-plated Dragons!
  The saurians of primeval slime they fought with tooth and claw,
  And SHO-KI'S dragon, though possessed of wondrous powers of jaw,
  And MIOCHIN'S scaly monster, whereat SHO-KI'S pluck might melt,
  And the dragon speared by stout St. George in the bold cartoons
       of SKELT,--
  These were but simple monsters, like the giants slain by JACK,
  But your dragon cased in armour-plate with turrets on his back,
  And a charged torpedo twisted in his huge and horrid tail.
  Is a thing to stagger Science, and to make poor Peace turn pale!

  Yes, East is East, and West is West; but the West looks on the East,
  And sees the bold Jap summoning to War's wild raven-feast
  The saffron-faced Celestial; and the game they're going to play
  (With a touch of Eastern goriness) in the wicked Western way.
  For the yellow-man has borrowed from the white-man all that's bad,
  From shoddy and fire-water, to the costly Ironclad.
  He will not have our Bibles, but he welcomes our Big Guns,
  And he blends with the wild savagery of Vandals, Goths or Huns,
  The scientific slaughter of the Blood-and-Iron Teuton!--
  A sight that Civilisation would right willingly be mute on.
  But these armour-plated dragons that infest the Yellow Sea
  Are worse than the Norse "Dragons" whose black raven flag flew free
  O'er fiord and ocean-furrow in the valorous Viking days.
  Heathen Chinee and Pagan Jap have learned our Western ways
  Of multitudinous bloodshed; every slaughtering appliance,
  Devices of death-dealing skill, and deviltries of Science
  Strengthen the stealthy Mongol and the sanguinary Turk;
  And Civilisation stands, and stares, and cries,
    "Is this _my_ work?"

       *       *       *       *       *

  Mem. by a Muddled One.

  "Poems in Prose" seem all the go.
    _They_'re bad enough, but worse
  The dreary hotch-potch we all know
    Too sadly;--prose in verse!

       *       *       *       *       *

  OLD THREE-VOL.

  There rose two Book-Kings in the West,
    Two Kings both great and high;
  And they have sworn a solemn oath
    Good old Three-Vol. shall die.

  They took a pen and wrote him down,
    Piled sins upon his head;
  And they have sworn a solemn oath
    Good old Three-Vol. is dead.

  But when "the Season" comes once more,
    And folks for fiction call,
  Old Three-Vol. _may_ rise up again,
    And sore surprise them all!

       *       *       *       *       *

  REMNANTS.

  (_A Pindaric Fragment._)

    In the young season's prime
  Yon remnant felt its major portion reft,
    And waited for the surplus time
    Ingloriously left.

  For it no glories of the lawn,
  No whirling in the valse that greets the dawn,
  No record in the fleeting roll of fame
    That gives the wearer's name,
  And tells a waiting world what gown she wore;
    While that which went before
  No cheaply-sober destiny has found
    But graced fair Fashion's ground,
    Where Pleasure, gaily deck'd,
  Within the fancied circle of select,
  Watches the Polo cavalry at war,
  The victim pigeons tumbled in their gore,
  The rival Blues at Lord's, the racing steeds
    On Ascot's piney meads,
  Or where luxuriant Goodwood's massy trees
    Murmur to no common breeze,
  And see afar the glint of England's summer seas.

  Impute no fault, ye proud, nor grandeur mock,
    If frugal Elegance, discreet and fair,
    The aftermath of lavish Fashion reap,
    And, having waited long with nought to wear,
    Get the same goods, though late, and get them cheap.
    Next year the daintiest gowns by lawn and lock
    May haply be the fruit of surplus summer stock.

  PART VI.--ROUND PEGS IN SQUARE HOLES.

  SCENE IX.--_The Entrance Hall at Wyvern._

_Tredwell_ (_to_ Lady CANTIRE). This way, if you please, my lady. Her
ladyship is in the Hamber Boudwore.

_Lady Cantire._ Wait. (_She looks round._) What has become of that young
Mr. ANDROM----? (_Perceiving_ SPURRELL, _who has been modestly
endeavouring to efface himself._) Ah, _there_ he is! Now, come along,
and be presented to my sister-in-law. She'll be enchanted to know you!

_Spurrell._ But indeed, my lady I--I think I'd better wait till she
sends for me.

_Lady Cant._ Wait? Fiddlesticks! What! A famous young man like you!
Remember _Andromeda_, and don't make yourself so ridiculous!

_Spurr._ (_miserably_). Well, Lady CANTIRE, if her ladyship _says_
anything, I hope you'll bear me out that it wasn't----

_Lady Cant._ Bear you out? My good young man, you seem to need somebody
to bear you _in_! Come, you are under My wing. _I_ answer for your
welcome--so do as you're told.

_Spurr._ (_to himself, as he follows resignedly_). It's my belief
there'll be a jolly row when I _do_ go in; but it's not my fault!

_Tred._ (_opening the door of the Amber Boudoir_), Lady CANTIRE and Lady
MAISIE MULL. (_To_ SPURRELL.) What name, if you please, Sir?

_Spurr._ (_dolefully_). You can say "JAMES SPURRELL"--you needn't
_bellow_ it, you know!

_Tred._ (_ignoring this suggestion_). Mr. JAMES SPURRELL.

_Spurr._ (_to himself, on the threshold_). If I don't get the chuck for
this, I _shall_ be surprised, that's all!

                              [_He enters._

  [Illustration: "What name, if you please, Sir?"]

  SCENE X.--_In a Fly._

_Undershell_ (_to himself_). Alone with a lovely girl, who has no
suspicion, as yet, that I am the poet whose songs have thrilled her with
admiration! _Could_ any situation be more romantic? I think I must keep
up this little mystification as long as possible.

_Phillipson_ (_to herself_). I wonder who he is. _Somebody's_ Man, I
suppose. I do believe he's struck with me. Well, I've no objection. I
don't see why I shouldn't forget JIM now and then--he's quite forgotten
me! (_Aloud._) They might have sent a decent carriage for us instead of
this ramshackle old summerhouse. We shall be _hours_ getting to the
house at this rate!

_Und._ (_gallantly_). For my part, I care not how long we may be. I feel
so unspeakably content to be where I am.

_Phill._ (_disdainfully_). In this mouldy, lumbering old concern? You
must be rather easily contented, then!

_Und._ (_dreamily_). It travels only too swiftly. To me it is a
veritable enchanted car, drawn by a magic steed.

_Phill._ I don't know whether he's magic--but I'm sure he's lame. And I
shouldn't call stuffiness _enchantment_ myself.

_Und._ I'm not prepared to deny the stuffiness. But cannot you guess
what has transformed this vehicle for me--in spite of its undeniable
shortcomings--or must I speak more plainly still?

_Phill._ Well, considering the shortness of our acquaintance, I must say
you've spoken quite plainly enough as it is!

_Und._ I know I must seem unduly expansive, and wanting in reserve; and
yet that is not my true disposition. In general, I feel an almost
fastidious shrinking from strangers----

_Phill._ (_with a little laugh_). Really, I shouldn't have thought it!

_Und._ Because, in the present case, I do not--I cannot--feel as if we
_were_ strangers. Some mysterious instinct led me, almost from the
first, to associate you with a certain Miss MAISIE MULL.

_Phill._ Well, I wonder how you discovered _that_. Though you shouldn't
have said "Miss"--_Lady_ MAISIE MULL is the name.

_Und._ (_to himself_). Lady MAISIE MULL! I attach no meaning to
titles--and yet nothing but rank could confer such perfect ease and
distinction. (_Aloud._) I should have said _Lady_ MAISIE MULL,
undoubtedly--forgive my ignorance. But at least I have divined you. Does
nothing tell you who and what _I_ may be?

_Phill._ Oh, I think I can give a tolerable guess at what _you_ are.

_Und._ You recognise the stamp of the Muse upon me, then?

_Phill._ Well, I shouldn't have taken you for a _groom_ exactly.

_Und._ (_with some chagrin_). You are really too flattering!

_Phill._ Am I? Then it's your turn now. You might say you'd never have
taken me for a _lady's maid_!

_Und._ I might--if I had any desire to make an unnecessary and insulting
remark.

_Phill._ Insulting? Why, it's what I _am_! I'm maid to Lady MAISIE. I
thought your mysterious instinct told you all about it?

_Und._ (_to himself--after the first shock_). A lady's maid! Gracious
Heaven! What have I been saying--or rather, what _haven't_ I? (_Aloud._)
To--to be sure it did. Of course, I quite understand _that_. (_To
himself_). Oh, confound it all, I wish we were at Wyvern!

_Phill._ And, after all, you've never told me who _you_ are. Who _are_
you?

_Und._ (_to himself_). I must not humiliate this poor girl! (_Aloud._)
I? Oh--a very insignificant person, I assure you! (_To himself._) This
is an occasion in which deception is pardonable--even justifiable!

_Phill._ Oh, I knew _that_. But you let out just now you had to do with
a Mews. You aren't a rough-rider, are you?

_Und._ N--not _exactly_--not a _rough_-rider. (_To himself._) Never on a
horse in my life!--unless I count my _Pegasus_. (_Aloud._) But you are
right in supposing I am connected with a muse--in one sense.

_Phill._ I _said_ so, didn't I? Don't you think it was rather clever of
me to spot you, when you're not a bit horsey-looking?

_Und._ (_with elaborate irony_). Accept my compliments on a power of
penetration which is simply phenomenal!

_Phill._ (_giving him a little push_). Oh, go along--it's all talk with
you--I don't believe you mean a word you say!

_Und._ (_to himself_). She's becoming absolutely vulgar. (_Aloud._) I
don't--I _don't_; it's a manner I have; you mustn't attach any
importance to it--none whatever!

_Phill._ What! Not to all those high-flown compliments? Do you mean to
tell me you're only a gay deceiver, then?

_Und._ (_in horror_). Not a _deceiver_, no; and decidedly not _gay_. I
mean I _did_ mean the _compliments_, of course. (_To himself._) I
mustn't let her suspect anything, or she'll get talking about it; it
would be too horrible if this were to get round to Lady MAISIE or the
CULVERINS--so undignified; and it would ruin all my _prestige_! Ive only
to go on playing a part for a few minutes, and--maid or not--she's a
most engaging girl!

   [_He goes on playing the part, with the unexpected result of sending
       Miss_ PHILLIPSON _into fits of uncontrollable laughter._

  SCENE XI.--_The Back Entrance at Wyvern._
_The Fly has just set down_ PHILLIPSON _and_ UNDERSHELL.

_Tredwell_ (_receiving_ PHILLIPSON). Lady MAISIE'S maid, I presume? I'm
the butler here--Mr. TREDWELL. Your ladies arrived some time back. I'll
take you to the housekeeper, who'll show you their rooms, and where
yours is, and I hope you'll find everything comfortable. (_In an
undertone, indicating_ UNDERSHELL, _who is awaiting recognition in the
doorway._) Do you happen to know who it is _with_ you?

_Phillipson_ (_in a whisper_). I can't quite make him out he's so
flighty in his talk. But he _says_ he belongs to some Mews or other.

_Tred._ Oh, then _I_ know who he is. We expect him right enough. He's a
partner in a crack firm of Vets. We've sent for him special. I'd better
see to him, if you don't mind finding your own way to the Housekeeper's
Room, second door to the left, down that corridor. (PHILLIPSON
_departs_.) Good morning to you, Mr.--ah--Mr.----?

_Undershell_ (_coming forward_). Mr. UNDERSHELL. Lady CULVERIN expects
me, I believe.

Tred. Quite correct, Mr. UNDERSHELL, Sir. She do. Leastwise, I shouldn't
say myself she'd require to see you--well, not _before_ to-morrow
morning--but you won't mind _that_, I daresay.

_Und._ (_choking_). Not mind that! Take me to her at once!

_Tred._ Couldn't take it on myself, Sir, really. There's no particular
'urry. I'll let her ladyship know you're 'ere; and if she wants you,
she'll send for you; but, with a party staying in the 'ouse, and others
dining with us to-night, it ain't likely as she'll have time for you
till to-morrow.

_Und._ Oh then, whenever her ladyship should find leisure to recollect
my existence, will you have the goodness to inform her that I have taken
the liberty of returning to town by the next train?

_Tred._ Lor! Mr. UNDERSHELL, you aren't so pressed as all _that_, are
you? I know my lady wouldn't like you to go without seeing you
personally; no more wouldn't Sir RUPERT. And I understood you was coming
down for the Sunday!

_Und._ (_furious_). So did _I_--but not to be treated like this!

_Tred._ (_soothingly_). Why, _you_ know what ladies are. And you
couldn't see _Deerfoot_--not properly, to-night, either.

_Und._ I have seen enough of this place already. I intend to go back by
the next train, I tell you.

_Tred._ But there _ain't_ any next train up to-night--being a loop
line--not to mention that I've sent the fly away, and they can't spare
no one at the stables to drive you in. Come Sir, make the best of it.
I've had my horders to see that you're made comfortable, and Mrs.
POMFRET and me will expect the pleasure of your company at supper in the
'ousekeeper's room, 9.30 sharp. I'll send the Steward's Room Boy to show
you to your room.

                    [_He goes, leaving_ UNDERSHELL _speechless._

_Und._ (_almost foaming_). The insolence of these cursed aristocrats!
Lady CULVERIN will see me when she has time, forsooth! I am to be
entertained in the servants' hall! _This_ is how our upper classes
honour poetry! I won't stay a single hour under their infernal roof.
I'll walk. But where _to_? And how about my luggage?

                              [PHILLIPSON _returns._

_Phill._ Mr. TREDWELL says you want to go already! It _can't_ be true!
Without even waiting for supper?

_Und._ (_gloomily_). Why should I wait for supper in this house?

_Phill._ Well, _I_ shall be there; I don't know if _that_'s any
inducement.

                              [_She looks down._

_Und._ (_to himself_). She is a singularly bewitching creature; and I'm
starving. Why _shouldn't_ I stay--if only to shame these CULVERINS? It
will be an experience--a study in life. I can always go afterwards. I
_will_ stay. (_Aloud._) You little know the sacrifice you ask of me, but
enough; I give way. We shall meet--(_with a gulp_)--in the housekeeper's
room!

_Phill._ (_highly amused_). You _are_ a comical little man. You'll be
the death of me if you go on like that!

                              [_She flits away._

_Und._ (_alone_). I feel disposed to be the death of _somebody!_ Oh,
Lady MAISIE MULL, to what a bathos have you lured your poet by your
artless flattery--a banquet with your aunt's butler!

  OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

"There are, methinks," quoth the Baron, "two or three novels--one
certainly I can call to mind--wherein the interior domestic life of Jews
strict in the observance of their ancient and most touching religious
rites and ceremonies is more amply, as well as more minutely, described
than in Mr. FARJEON'S _Aaron the Jew_, which, be it my pleasing duty to
testify, is one of the best of this prolific author's works; a simple,
touching story, the interest being well kept up, as of course the
"interest" should be when dealing with the true history of one who
commenced as a pawnbroker." As to the rites above mentioned, no special
or intimate personal experience is shown to be possessed by the author,
who could very easily have obtained his materials from an interesting
work entitled, as I fancy, _The Jew at Home_, which has, the Baron
regrets to say, disappeared from its shelf in the Baron's library.
_Aaron_ is lively, is gay, is witty, a "_Jew d'esprit,_" and, like _Mr.
Peter Magnus_, he amuses a small circle of intimate friends; but his
story, and that of his sweet wife _Rachel_, as related by Mr. FARJEON,
will increase this friendly circle to a very considerable extent. The
Baron ventures to think that a good deal of the dialogue and of the
descriptive writing is unnecessary,--but Mr. FARJEON likes to give
everyone plenty for their money,--and, further, that the story would
have gained by the loss of what would have reduced the three volumes to
two. But altogether, the novel is "recommended" by the interested but
disinterested

  A mild but new sensation for the holidays at hand;
  Your planet's "terminator," it seems, is now ablaze--
  'Tis, say the _cognoscenti_, a signal that you raise!

  What is it that you're shewing terrestrial telescopes?
  Is't pills you're advertising, or booming patent soaps?
  How on earth can one discover what by this beacon's meant,
  Whether news of Royal Weddings or Railway Strikes is sent?

  Alas! We haven't mastered the transplanetic code;

  Exceptional measures I hate,

  The good old "Brown Bess" I prefer, I confess,
    To a new (Parliamentary) Gatling.
  To fight in the old-fashioned way,
    Good temperedly, fairly, politely,
  Is more to my mind; but these fellows, I find,
  Will not _let_ a leader be knightly.

  If BALFOUR would only fight fair;
    And impose that condition on BARTLEY;
  If JOE would not ravage and shriek like a savage;
    Did TOMMY talk less, and less tartly;
  Were GOSCHEN less eager for scalps,
    And kept a tight rein upon HANBURY;
  Why then 'twere all right; we'd soon get through our fight
    And hatred in love's flowing can bury.

  But no, they're like Soudanese blacks,
    All fury and wild ugly rushes.
  They shriek and they shock, and they hack and they hock,
    Till chivalry shudders and blushes.
  And so the machine-gun, I find,
    Is just the one thing _will_ arrest 'em.
  They've quite lost their head, but a fair _rain_ of lead
    Played on them will try 'em and test 'em!

  My heart is like a driver-club,
    That heaves the pellet hard and straight,
  That carries every let and rub.
    The whole performance really great;
  My heart is like a bulger-head,
    That whiffles on the wily tee,--
  Because my love distinctly said
    She'd halve the round of life with me.

  My heart is also like a cleek,
    Resembling most the mashie sort,
  That spanks the object, so to speak,
    Across the sandy bar to port;
  And hers is like a putting green,
    The haven where I boast to be,
  For she assures me she is keen
    To halve the round of life with me.

  Some wear their hearts upon their sleeve,
    And others lose 'em on the links;
  (This play of words is, by your leave,
    Rather original, one thinks;)
  Therefore my heart is like to some
    Lost ball that nestles on the lea,
  Because my love has kindly come
    To halve the round of life with me.

  Raise me a bunker, if you can,
    That beetles o'er a deadly ditch,
  Where any but the bogey-man
    Is practically bound to pitch;
  Plant me beneath a hedge of thorn,
    Or up a figurative tree,
  What matter, when my love has sworn
    To halve the round of life with me?

  The Primrose League wild war doth wage,
  And the much-boomed Book in cover and page
    Like the Age itself is--Yellow.
  Well, Yellow's the tint of Gold--and Brass!
  Of the Golden Calf--and the Golden Ass!
  Of the "livery" face and the faded leaf,
  But 'tis tedious, very, beyond belief.
  I own I am little inclined to smile
  On the colour of age, decay, and bile
    And mustard, and _Othello_;
  I'm tired, I own, of it's very look,
  And I feel compelled to cock a snook
  At the Yellow Primrose, the Yellow Book.
      Though an Age indeed
      That runs to seed
    Is like to run to Yellow!

  A LITTLE HOLIDAY.

_Sunday._--How exhausting is London life! Up late, night and morning.
Club. See summer number of illustrated paper. Pictures of pretty girls,
reclining in punts, hammocks, or deck-chairs, doing nothing, men helping
them. True holiday for jaded Londoner. Perhaps better without pretty
girls. Even more reposeful. Must get right away. Secluded place. No
pretty girls. That tiny inn JONES told me about. Miles from everywhere.

_Monday._--At Tiny Inn. Fine afternoon. Feel quite happy. With summer
clothes, summer numbers, flannels, straw hat, and other suitable things.
Seven miles from station. Beautifully clean. Perfectly quiet. Weather
changing. Raining. Landlord says, "Soon over." Eggs and bacon for
supper. To bed early.

_Tuesday._--Wake at five. Up at six to enjoy morning air. Eggs and bacon
for breakfast. Still raining. Landlord says, "Very remarkable, since in
this place it never rains." Somehow the clouds always pass over
neighbouring village, following the course of the river, the ridge of
the hills, or something. Have noticed in all country places that the
clouds always do this, except when _I_ am there. Impossible to lounge
under a tree in this rain. Stop indoors, smoke, and read summer numbers.
Eggs and bacon for lunch. Rain going on steadily. Put on flannels, go
out. Drenched. Eggs and bacon for dinner. Landlord says they hope to
give me some meat to-morrow. Butcher calls once a week apparently. Wet
evening. Somewhat tired of sitting on horsehair sofa with damaged
springs. Know all the summer numbers by heart. To bed at ten.

_Wednesday._--Wake at four. Toss about till six. Then up. Still raining.
Breakfast,--eggs and bacon. Landlord says if I cross two fields I shall
find the river and a punt. Thanks. Will wait till rain stops. He says it
is sure to stop soon. Ask him if one can get a London paper. Says they
sometimes have one at the stationer's, four miles off, but generally
only when ordered. Lends me a local paper of last week. Reduced to
summer numbers again. Begin to wish there were some pretty girls here,
after all. They might enliven things. After lunch,--of eggs and
bacon,--resolve to go out. Ask landlord where one can go. Don't like to
ask "if any girls about anywhere?" Accidentally landlord _does_ happen
to mention Farmer MUGGERIDGE'S daughters. I pretend indifference, but
inquire as to direction of MUGGERIDGE'S farm. Lose my way. Wander
helplessly. Steady downpour. Return, drenched. Butcher has not been.
Eggs and bacon for dinner. Smoke, and read advertisements--plenty of
them--in summer numbers. To bed at nine.

_Thursday._--Wake at three. Toss about till seven. Then breakfast--usual
dish. Rain, not quite so heavy. With fuller directions as to road, start
hopefully for MUGGERIDGE'S farm. Arrive there. Heavy rain again.
MUGGERIDGE loafing about. Country people always loaf about in rain. They
seem to enjoy it. Chat with him. He asks me in to have some cider.
Accept. Chance of seeing charming daughters. They enter! Now!... Oh!
awful!... Cider acid. Obliged to drink it. Hurry back. Lunch. Usual
dish. Still raining. Call in landlord, and ask eagerly about trains to
London. The next is to-morrow morning, at 8.20. Give way to despair.
Refuse eggs and bacon for dinner. Bed eight.

_Friday._--Leave in landlord's cart at seven, after usual breakfast.
Still raining steadily. Gave landlord all those summer numbers to amuse
future weather-bound visitors with imaginary pictures of rural
happiness. London once more! Hurrah! Dinner--_not_ eggs and bacon.
Theatre. Smoke at club. Avoid JONES. Tell SMITH I know the sweetest
place for country peace and seclusion. He writes down the address
eagerly. Those summer numbers will amuse him. To bed--any time!

window is no bad coign of vantage for an observant penman. "The World

very man to write it. Let Mr. PAYN think of it. _Mr. Punch's_ present

  SATURDAY POPS.

  NEW SERIES.

"RUSTICUS," who is clearly "RUSTICUS EXPECTANS," was moved to write to
the _Chronicle_ on July 31st, to say that, though not a rich man, he
lives in a pretty Surrey village within an eightpenny return railway
fare of the City; and has a fairly large and quiet garden, with field,
&c. "The trees are all at their finest," he proceeds, "the flowers
looking very gay and walking in the garden." Capital fun this, when
flowers actually walk about. But no! it's "walking in the garden to-day
the thought came to me," so it's a walking thought, comparable,
doubtless, to a running commentary. Anyhow. "RUSTICUS" is moved--by the
thought of a "tired working-man or band of City workers" who would find
in his garden pleasure on a quiet Saturday afternoon--to make an offer.
Here are his words:--

    "I am a bachelor, therefore I say, men, you are welcome to
    my very simple hospitality if it is of any use to you. I can
    do with a limited number every or any Saturday. Any creed or
    class is welcome. All I stipulate for is honest souls. Come
    and smoke and talk under the trees and spend a quiet time
    away from the town. I simply condition--no publicity or
    fuss, the giving and acceptance of the invitation quietly,
    honestly, brother to brother. Would you, Sir, forward any
    letters on to me?"

This is of course an example which will be followed, and _Mr. Punch_ has
already had the following letter (amongst others), which he now prints
with pleasure.

SIR,--Owing to the Death Duties, I am no longer a rich man, but I have a
little house in Piccadilly, not more than a twopenny 'bus ride from
Charing Cross. It has occurred to me that some hungry working-man might
like to drop in to a quiet little dinner some night. I am a Duke,
therefore I say, comrades in depression, you are welcome to my roof, if
it's of any use to you. I can dine a hundred or so of you any or every
night. All I stipulate for is that there shall be no speaking, for
speaking bores me horribly.

_He. (resting)._ Good floor, isn't it?

_She._ Quite. But tell me, have you been attending the Congress?

_He._ Of course; that is why I received an invitation to-night.

_She._ And you found the lectures and all that most interesting?

_He._ Yes, very; and then there were the Opera and the theatres in the
evening.

_She._ But do let us talk about the Congress. Did you not discuss
sanitation?

_He._ Discussed it very much indeed. So fortunate too that we had the
meeting before everybody had left town.

_She._ Yes. But did you not inquire into microbes and all that?

_He._ Certainly; had a lot of talk about them, and finished them all up
just in time not to interfere with Goodwood.

_She._ And I suppose you found out the way to keep everyone in perfect
health?

_He._ That was the idea, and yet we floored Lords and the Oval.

_She._ But oughtn't every town to be in a satisfactory condition?

_He._ Why, yes. But that depends upon the season of the year. Of course,
some places are deadly dull when nothing's going on from a social point
of view.

_She._ I mean from a health point of view--oughtn't everything nowadays
to be simply excellent?

_He._ Yes, of course. That's the modern theory.

_She._ And yet, according to the papers, London is full of fever and
insanity.

_He._ I daresay; the Press men generally get their figures right.

_She._ But if, theoretically, everything is right, why should most
things be practically wrong?

_He._ You must really ask me another.

_She._ But you are strong upon health, are you not?

_He._ Very--in the lecture-room. And now, if you are rested, we will
have another turn.

  ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

  EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Commons, Monday, July 30._--Having settled Budget Bill, and,
incidentally, brought CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER to Death's Door by
observations on Death Duties, TOMMY BOWLES has time to turn his
attention to another social question. Looks as if he were going to take
the Bicycle Fiend by the scruff of the neck. Herein he has opportunity
of deepening and enlarging his hold on affection and esteem of British
public. Bicycle Fiend has increased, is increasing, and, at least, ought
to be registered. He comes upon the hapless rider or pedestrian in quiet
country lanes, brushing him aside as if the earth were the Fiend's and
all the highways thereof. Bad enough in the country, where there is room
to get out of the way. In crowded streets of metropolis, Fiend pounces
round unsuspected corners upon elderly gentlemen, scattering streams of
peaceful passengers at peremptory sound of fearsome bell.

TOMMY B. got his eye on him. Not without suspicion that this new
departure has something to do with old, now closed, campaign against the
Budget. TOMMY warned the SQUIRE whilst in Committee that his Death
Duties would not reap the full harvest anticipated. Every little helps.
What with actual concussions and sudden frights, Bicycle Fiend leads in
course of financial year to considerable succession of property changing
on sudden death, with concurrent toll paid to Treasury. If the Bicycle
Fiend can only be placed on same footing as the common carrier, or the
harried hansom-cab driver, the death-rate would appreciably decrease,
and with it the flow of legacy and succession duties. TOMMY may or may
not look thus far ahead. No matter, if he only succeeds in restraining a
nuisance that is a disgrace to a civilised community.

The Member for SARK tells me he has a Short Way with the B. F., which
makes him to considerable extent indifferent to slower action of HOME
SECRETARY, who has evidently never had his shins barked by this agency.
SARK says when he takes his walks abroad he usually carries a stick or
umbrella. When, crossing a road, he hears the tinkle of the Fiend's
bell, insolently and imperatively ordering him out of the way on pain
of being run over, he, instead of flying for his life, as is the use of
the ordinary citizen, carelessly throws stick or umbrella lance-wise
across hollow of right or left arm, according as the Fiend approaches
from one direction or the other. Thus armed he leisurely pursues his
way. If the Fiend continues on the track, he will run with face or chest
on to the point of the umbrella. As that would be inconvenient to him,
he slows up or goes on another tack, and when he arrives home writes a
letter to the _Bicycling Blister_, indignantly denouncing a street
passenger who wouldn't get out of his way.

_Business done._--Vote on Account through Committee.

_Tuesday._--"PRINCE ARTHUR," said SARK, looking across at the Front
Opposition Bench whilst COURTNEY was speaking, "succeeds in hiding all
traces of storm behind a smiling countenance. JOSEPH, on the contrary,
more ingenuous, less acute in practice of worldly wiles, enables one to
realise, even at this long distance of time, what BALAK, the son of
ZIPPOR, King of Moab, looked like when he stood in the high places of
Baal, and listened to BALAAM'S remarks on the motion for the
time-closure to be applied to the Children of Israel, who had pitched
their tents in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho, and
declined to budge at the bidding of BALAK."

Appearance of Parliamentary BALAAM on scene dramatically effective.
Crowded House worked up to highest pitch of excitement by swift
encounter, in which JOHN MORLEY had followed PRINCE ARTHUR, and JOSEPH,
springing in from behind, had clouted the CHIEF SECRETARY on the head.
The SQUIRE had moved time-closure on Evicted Tenants Bill in speech the
studied tameness and provoking brevity of which had riled Opposition
much more than if he had belaboured them with Harcourtian phrase. SAGE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE said a few words, preparatory to packing up for
holiday; then COURTNEY rose from JOSEPH'S side to continue debate.
Members, taking it for granted that he, possibly with some reservations
in favour of Eviction Bill whose second reading he had supported, was
about to say ditto to JOSEPH on question of Closure, began to move
towards door. Arrested by COURTNEY'S solemn tone, and his expression of
regret, evidently unfeigned, at deplorable condition in which the House
found itself. "Woe to those through whom offences come!" cried COURTNEY
in voice which, as he said, was of one crying in the wilderness, and
seemed for its perfect effect to lack only hirsute garb, stave and
honeypot. "Through whom did the offence come? Surely," continued the
Prophet, bending shaggy eyebrows upon the bench where the Busy B's hive,
"the offence lies with those Members who, disregarding the true uses,
functions, duties, and high mission of the House, abuse their powers,
intent to destroy possibility of the right conduct of public business."

Not Ministers, then, with the SQUIRE at their head, responsible for the
deadlock, as PRINCE ARTHUR had painted the scene, and as JOSEPH had
touched it up with stronger colour. It was the Busy Bees. They and "a
junta of irresponsible landlords enforcing their will upon those who
ought to resist them."

O BALAAM! BALAAM! M.P. for Bodmin. Was it for this JOSEPH led thee into
the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah? For this did PRINCE ARTHUR
build seven altars, and offer up the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD on every one of
them? Long time since such a scene was wrought in the House. SAUNDERSON
pished and pshawed, and looked anxiously round for LOGAN. BARTLEY
blushed; HANBURY was hushed; and a tear trickled down the pale cheek of
TOMMY BOWLES--Cap'en no longer, disrated and denounced.

_Business done._--Time-Closure resolution carried.

_Thursday._--Such larks! Yesterday time-closure came into operation in
connection with Evicted Tenants Bill. Arranged that if debate on Clause
I not finished by eleven o'clock to-night, all Amendments remaining on
paper shall be submitted to vote without further debate. Obstruction
scotched; wriggles helplessly, like eel in muddy depths of river,
smitten by the spear.

"Shan't play," whimper PRINCE ARTHUR and JOSEPH, mingling their tears at
this fresh evidence of tyranny, this last illustration of man's
inhumanity to man.

Strike ordered in Unionist lines. Men throw down the pick; hand in the
shovel and the hoe; put on their coats; hang about corners of Lobby in
approved strike fashion. If HANBURY and the Blameless BARTLEY could only
be induced to stick short clay pipe in side of mouth (bowl downwards),
fasten a leather strap outside their trousers just below the knee, and
drink four-half out of pewters at bar in the Lobby, scene would be
complete.

Strike only partial. Fully one half the men refuse to go out; stand by
the masters, turning deaf ear to blandishments and threats of pickets
outside. Strange thing is that, working at half strength, output more
than doubled. Time-closure, with all hands at work, proposed to complete
Committee by eleven o'clock next Tuesday night. At ten minutes past six
this afternoon the whole thing through. Not hurried either. Thoroughly
debated, divided on, and Bill, in more than one instance, amended.

"Fact is," said the SQUIRE, beaming with chastened delight at turn
events taken, "we are over-manned just as London is over-cabbed. Must
see if something can't be done to reduce numbers by refusing licenses
for fresh elections when vacancies occur."

_Business done._--Evicted Tenants Bill through Committee. Building
Societies Bill far advanced.

Lords'. See how you get on there!"]

_Friday._--Back in the mud again. Strike operative only when Evicted
Tenants Bill under consideration. That standing over now for Report
Stage. Meanwhile take up again Equalisation of Rates Bill. Men on strike
stream in, tired of "playing." Wonderful their eagerness to get to work
again, their keen delight in sound of their own voices, so strangely
intermitted. BARTLEY, KIMBER, FISHER, JOKIM, and the WOOLWICH INFANT all
here again, with WEBSTER (of St. Pancras) wobbling all over the place,

CRYPTOGRAMMATIST WANTED.--After a plain matter-of-fact paragraph in the
_Daily Telegraph_, stating that "Lord GREVILLE leaves town to-day for
Harrogate" (to undergo the "tonic sul-phur" cure, of course, _i.e._, of
water-course), there appeared this mysterious announcement, "Lord ROWTON
_leaves London to-day for some weeks._" Now where is "some weeks"? Of
course as his Lordship has quitted town for "some weeks," he evidently
prefers "some weeks," wherever it is, to London. And that is all we know
at present. Strange disappearance. Weird.

honest "_Chevalier d'Industrie_."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
