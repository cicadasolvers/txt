CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA


PREAMBLE.

[Sidenote: Preamble.]

We, the people of the State of North Carolina, grateful to Almighty God,
the Sovereign Ruler of Nations, for the preservation of the American
Union, and the existence of our civil, political and religious
liberties, and acknowledging our dependence upon Him for the continuance
of those blessings to us and our posterity, do for the more certain
security thereof, and for the better government of this State, ordain
and establish this Constitution:


ARTICLE I.

DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.

That the great, general and essential principles of liberty and free
government may be recognized and established, and that the relations of
this State to the Union and Government of the United States, and those
of the people of this State to the rest of the American people, may be
defined and affirmed, we do declare:

[Sidenote: The equality and rights of men.]

SECTION 1. That we hold it to be self-evident that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits
of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness.

[Sidenote: Political power and government.]

SEC. 2. That all political power is vested in, and derived from, the
people; all government of right originates from the people, is founded
upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the
whole.

[Sidenote: Internal government of the State.]

SEC. 3. That the people of this State have the inherent, sole and
exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police
thereof, and of altering and abolishing their Constitution and form of
government whenever it may be necessary for their safety and happiness;
but every such right should be exercised in pursuance of law, and
consistently with the Constitution of the United States.

[Sidenote: That there is no right to secede.]

SEC. 4. That this State shall ever remain a member of the American
Union; that the people thereof are a part of the American Nation; that
there is no right on the part of the State to secede, and that all
attempts, from whatever source or upon whatever pretext, to dissolve
said Union, or to sever said Nation, ought to be resisted with the whole
power of the State.

[Sidenote: Of allegiance to the U. S. government.]

SEC. 5. That every citizen of this State owes paramount allegiance to
the Constitution and government of the United States, and that no law or
ordinance of the State in contravention or subversion thereof can have
any binding force.

[Sidenote: Public debt.]

[Sidenote: Bonds issued under ordinance of Convention of 1868 and under
acts of 1868, 1868-'69, 1869-'70, declared invalid.]

[Sidenote: Exception.]

SEC. 6. The State shall never assume or pay, or authorize the collection
of any debt or obligation, express or implied, incurred in aid of
insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for
the loss or emancipation of any slave; nor shall the General Assembly
assume or pay, or authorize the collection of any tax to pay, either
directly or indirectly, expressed or implied, any debt or bond incurred,
or issued, by authority of the Convention of the year one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-eight, nor any debt or bond incurred or issued by the
Legislature of the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, at
its special session of the year one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-eight, or at its regular sessions of the years one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-eight and one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine
and one thousand eight hundred and seventy, except the bonds issued to
fund the interest on the old debt of the State, unless the proposing to
pay the same shall have first been submitted to the people and by them
ratified by the vote of a majority of all the qualified voters of the
State, at a regular election held for that purpose.

[Sidenote: Exclusive emoluments, etc.]

SEC. 7. No man or set of men are entitled to exclusive or separate
emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of
public services.

[Sidenote: The legislative, executive and judicial powers distinct.]

SEC. 8. The legislative, executive and supreme judicial powers of the
government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other.

[Sidenote: Of the power of suspending laws.]

SEC. 9. All power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any
authority, without the consent of the representatives of the people, is
injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.

[Sidenote: Elections free.]

SEC. 10. All elections ought to be free.

[Sidenote: In criminal prosecutions.]

SEC. 11. In all criminal prosecutions, every man has the right to be
informed of the accusation against him and to confront the accusers and
witnesses with other testimony, and to have counsel for his defense, and
not to be compelled to give evidence against himself, or to pay costs,
jail fees, or necessary witness fees of the defense, unless found
guilty.

[Sidenote: Answers to criminal charges.]

SEC. 12. No person shall be put to answer any criminal charge, except as
hereinafter allowed, but by indictment, presentment or impeachment.

[Sidenote: Right of jury.]

SEC. 13. No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous
verdict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court. The Legislature
may, however, provide other means of trial for petty misdemeanors, with
the right of appeal.

[Sidenote: Excessive bail.]

SEC. 14. Excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted.

[Sidenote: General warrants.]

SEC. 15. General warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be
commanded to search suspected places, without evidence of the act
committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, whose offense is
not particularly described and supported by evidence, are dangerous to
liberty and ought not to be granted.

[Sidenote: Imprisonment for debt.]

SEC. 16. There shall be no imprisonment for debt in this State, except
in cases of fraud.

[Sidenote: No person to be taken, etc., but by law of the land.]

SEC. 17. No person ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his
freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed or exiled, or in any
manner deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the law of the
land.

[Sidenote: Persons restrained of liberty.]

SEC. 18. Every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to a remedy
to enquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same, if
unlawful; and such remedy ought not to be denied or delayed.

[Sidenote: Controversies at law respecting property.]

SEC. 19. In all controversies at law respecting property, the ancient
mode of trial by jury is one of the best securities of the rights of the
people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable.

[Sidenote: Freedom of the press.]

SEC. 20. The freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of
liberty, and therefore ought never to be restrained, but every
individual shall be held responsible for the abuse of the same.

[Sidenote: Habeas corpus.]

SEC. 21. The privileges of the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall not be
suspended.

[Sidenote: Property qualification.]

SEC. 22. As political rights and privileges are not dependent upon, or
modified by, property, therefore no property qualification ought to
affect the right to vote or hold office.

[Sidenote: Representation and taxation.]

SEC. 23. The people of the State ought not to be taxed, or made subject
to the payment of any impost or duty, without the consent of themselves,
or their representatives in General Assembly freely given.

[Sidenote: Militia and the right to bear arms.]

SEC. 24. A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed; and, as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to
liberty, they ought not to be kept up, and the military should be kept
under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. Nothing
herein contained shall justify the practice of carrying concealed
weapons, or prevent the Legislature from enacting penal statutes against
said practice.

[Sidenote: Right of the people to assemble together.]

SEC. 25. The people have a right to assemble together to consult for
their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to
the Legislature for redress of grievances. But secret political
societies are dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and should
not be tolerated.

[Sidenote: Religious liberty.]

SEC. 26. All men have a natural and inalienable right to worship
Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no
human authority should, in any case whatever, control or interfere with
the rights of conscience.

[Sidenote: Education.]

SEC. 27. The people have the right to the privilege of education, and it
is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right.

[Sidenote: Elections should be frequent.]

SEC. 28. For redress of grievances, and for amending and strengthening
the laws, elections should be often held.

[Sidenote: Recurrence to fundamental principles.]

SEC. 29. A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely
necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty.

[Sidenote: Hereditary emoluments, etc.]

SEC. 30. No hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors ought to be
granted or conferred in this State.

[Sidenote: Perpetuities, etc.]

SEC. 31. Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a
free State and ought not to be allowed.

[Sidenote: Ex post facto laws.]

SEC. 32. Retrospective laws, punishing acts committed before the
existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are
oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no _ex post
facto_ law ought to be made. No law taxing retrospectively sales,
purchases, or other acts previously done, ought to be passed.

[Sidenote: Slavery prohibited.]

SEC. 33. Slavery and Involuntary servitude, otherwise than for crime,
whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted, shall be and are
hereby forever prohibited within the State.

[Sidenote: State boundaries.]

SEC. 34. The limits and boundaries of the State shall be and remain as
they now are.

[Sidenote: Courts shall be open.]

SEC. 35. All courts shall be open; and every person for an injury done
him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due
course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial
or delay.

[Sidenote: Soldiers in time of peace.]

SEC. 36. No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house
without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war but in a manner
prescribed by the law.

[Sidenote: Other rights of the people.]

SEC. 37. This enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or
deny others retained by the people; and all powers not herein delegated
remain with the people.


ARTICLE II.

branches, both dependent on the people, to wit, a Senate and House of

at the respective times and periods when the districts of the Senate are
hereinbefore directed to be laid off.

[Sidenote: Ratio of representation.]

SEC. 6. In making the apportionment in the House of Representatives, the
ratio of representation shall be ascertained by dividing the amount of

part of the population of the State, by the number of Representatives,
less the number assigned to such counties; and in ascertaining the
number of the population of the State, aliens and Indians not taxed
shall not be included. To each county containing the said ratio and not
twice the said ratio, there shall be assigned one Representative; to
each county containing two but not three times the said ratio, there

[Sidenote: Private laws in relation to names of persons, etc.]

SEC. 11. The General Assembly shall not have power to pass any private
law to alter the name of any person, or to legitimate any person not

provide therein for the levying of tax for the payment of the principal
by the date such debt matures. The General Assembly shall have no power
to give or lend the credit of the State in aid of any person,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
