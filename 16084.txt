OUR LIST OF GOOD SAMARITANS.

This number of the MISSIONARY contains the annual list of our workers,
who go down the Jericho road to care for those who have been wronged,
the poor and ignorant, who need the Gospel. Our ministers and teachers
are not like the priest and the Levite, who looked upon the poor man and
then "passed by on the other side;" nor do they merely pity and utter
words of sympathy. They take right hold and help. They "pour in the oil
and the wine," and they build the _inns_--that is, the churches and
schoolhouses where they instruct and help the needy ones till they can
take care of themselves and help to take care of others--the most
genuine kind of assistance.

It must be remembered that this requires expenditure. The oil and the
wine, the inn and the constant attendance, call for money. Our
constituents, who furnish this, want the work done and well done, and
they are willing to pay for it. But sometimes they need to be reminded
of the cost. At our last Annual Meeting, the "two pence" which they had
during the year put into our hands, counted in American money, amounted
to $323,147.22; and they said: "Whatsoever thou spendest more, when I
come again I will repay thee." We are very careful to watch the receipts
and expenditures, and we find that for the three months since the Annual
Meeting, we have received from all sources $66,958.43; whereas, the
current expenditures for the three months require about $86,000. We give
this timely notice that they who commit to us this work may remit to us
what is needed.

Let it be understood that the generous gift of that noble friend of the
Negro race was not entrusted to us to do the work of the good Samaritans
of the Churches. We are not permitted to use it for this. The yearly
income of the Daniel Hand Fund is to do the work of Daniel Hand--no
more. For this, God will reward him and generations will bless him, but
he leaves the churches and individual Christians to carry on their own
work as before and to reap the blessings of it. We cannot give the
Daniel Hand Fund to the churches. We cannot expend it for the churches. It
relieves no one of duty and privilege. It is limited also, to its use.
The churches and the schools to which we are already committed call for
a great increase in self-denial and benevolence.

Pastors and members of the churches, the work is increasingly great. It
enlarges itself. Other denominations are increasing their efforts to
meet the pressing emergency. Let it not be said that our churches--the
first in the field and the most efficient--are falling behind in the
ranks. Let our banner be ever at the front. Let us do our work.

AN EXPLICIT WARNING.

One of our missionaries was recently at the North soliciting aid in
sustaining his work. His appeal was repeatedly met by the response: "The
Association is rich--it has just had a gift of more than a million of
dollars." When he explained that only the interest can be used, and this
for educational work only, the reply was: "This interest can be used in
payment of appropriations already made for schools, thus releasing just
so much for other purposes."

Now this is exactly what _cannot_ be done. The Daniel Hand Fund is for
_new_ work, and only in the industrial, primary and normal schools. It
is a priceless boon in this department, for we can now make enlargements
here which were greatly needed, but for which we had not the means; but
no part of this Fund can be applied to meet appropriations for other
portions of the work. If our constituents will not enable us to meet
those other demands, we can only report a debt; the Daniel Hand Fund
cannot help us. We are confident this needs only to be understood, for
we cannot believe that the 457,584 members of our churches have any wish
to shelter themselves behind Daniel Hand.

PRIVILEGES OF LIFE MEMBERSHIP.

The question is sometimes asked in letters we receive, What are the
privileges of a Life Member in the A.M.A.? We answer:

1. The privilege of voting at the Annual Meeting. Our amended
constitution says: "Members of evangelical churches may be constituted
members of this Association for life by the payment of $30 into its
treasury, with the written declaration at the time or times of payment
that the sum is to be applied to constitute a designated person a Life
Member, and such membership shall begin sixty days after the payment
shall have been completed."

2. A Life Member is entitled to THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY and to the
ANNUAL REPORT gratuitously, if desired.

3. The highest privilege is that of being a _live_ member, doing all
that he can to promote the interests of the Association and of the needy
peoples for whom it labors.

THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY.

We have two objects in printing this magazine. First, to have it read,
and, secondly, to have it paid for. The main purpose is the first, of
course, for we wish to have it read if it is not paid for, yet we
greatly prefer to have it both read and paid for. We believe that those
who pay for it are most likely to read it, and for this reason we fear
that this item will be seen only by those who do not need this reminder,
but we draw the bow at a venture and tell our readers that the price of
the magazine is 50 cents a year.

       *       *       *       *       *

We wish to inform the pastors and churches that we have just issued a
new _Annual Leaflet_, brief and packed with facts, and suitable for
distribution in the pews before collections are taken for the
Association. We shall be glad to furnish a supply gratuitously whenever
called for.

Our Annual Report, also, is ready for distribution. Those who wish it
will please send us a postal card requesting it.

THE ROMAN CATHOLICS AND THE FREEDMEN.

Soon after the war the Roman Catholics seemed to have made a strong
effort to win the Freedmen to their faith, and many Protestants felt a
good degree of apprehension that the splendors of the ceremonial and the
absence of race distinction might captivate the Negro. But the effort
was unsuccessful and appeared for a time to have been abandoned. It has
often been said, however, that the Church of Rome never surrenders an
undertaking; it may delay and wait for more auspicious times, but in the
end it perseveres. There are some indications of the renewal of the zeal
of the Papacy for the Negro. The article in another part of the
magazine, entitled "The Colored Catholic Congress," is an evidence.

One thing is certain. The Roman Catholic Church deserves praise for its
disregard of the color-line. The rich and the poor, the white and the
black, bow at the same altar, and one of the highest dignitaries of the
church is not ashamed to stand side by side with the black man on a
great public occasion. Protestants at the North and the South must not
allow the Romanists to surpass them in this Christ-like position.

       *       *       *       *       *

We ask our friends to read Mr. Dodge's article about the school at
Pleasant Hill, Tenn. One thousand dollars has already been pledged for
this building, on condition that the remainder of the $5,000 be secured.
We ask that this remainder be given by _individuals_, and not taken from
Church or Sunday-school contributions--all of which are needed for
current work.

NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND.

I have swapped horses--exchanged a Georgia mule for a New England
thoroughbred--and hereafter the "Notes in the Saddle" will be written
from this dignified seat. And what a change it is from the South to New
England!

Take a map and look it over. Put down in each State the illiteracy, and
make the comparison. In this good Commonwealth of Massachusetts only
seven-tenths of one per cent. of the native born white population are
illiterate, while in Georgia twenty-three per cent. of the native
whites, and in North Carolina thirty-two per cent. of the native whites,
are illiterate.

The South is pre-eminently the great missionary ground for our
Congregational Churches; for Congregationalism means the school-house as
truly as the church--and here in New England there is most enthusiastic
sympathy with, and support of, the American Missionary Association in
its great work in that section of our country committed to its care by
the churches.

They want the A.M.A. to take Congregationalism into the South, and
whether it organize churches mostly of whites or mostly of blacks, New
England demands that a Christian of any color be admitted into any
church because he is a Christian. The feeling is intense here and
growing more so.

Congregationalism could have planted its churches all over the South
before the war, but it would not strike hands with slavery; so, to-day
the children of the Pilgrims demand that the A.M.A., in its growing
work, shall stand true to the historic principles of the fathers, and
not compromise Christian truth for any seeming temporary advantage.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is great interest in the work among the American Highlanders which
the A.M.A. is pushing with such vigor. I spoke in a church near Boston
recently, and, after the service, a young man, his eyes bright, his face
flushed, hurried down the aisle and exclaimed, "I am a Kentuckian!" I
had been telling some plain and rather painful truths concerning the
people of Kentucky--the murders committed there; their lack of school
privileges, etc. I thought this friend might question some of my
statements, but I was delighted when he said: "I thank God that some one
is ready to call attention to the terrible needs of my own State. I
can't get people to believe me when I tell them of those needs. I was
brought up on the edge of the mountains and know them well, and I do not
believe there is any spot on earth more needy than that region of my own
State." He accentuated his words by a generous gift to the Mountain Work
of our Association.

       *       *       *       *       *

A good friend of the A.M.A. in Gorham, Me., put into my hands the letter
of Edward Payson, in which he accepted the call of the Second Parish
Church of Portland, requesting that it be sold and the proceeds go to
the A.M.A. work. It is a most interesting historical document, of value
to some one collecting historical literature. It was a generous gift,
for this kind woman valued it highly.

       *       *       *       *       *

The President, S.D. Smith, of the "Smith Organ Company," of Boston is
filling our schools with music, gladness and praise. He has sent three
organs to as many schools, within a few months, at no cost whatever to
the Association, giving these grand instruments and paying freight on
them to the field!

       *       *       *       *       *

One message that comes from the work in North Carolina is of so much
interest that it ought to have a place here. A teacher had been visiting
her former field of labor, and she writes of this visit as follows:

"One young man, who was but a small lad when I left there, came to shake
hands with me and said, 'Do you remember how you talked to me right out
there under that tree? I tried at first to get away from you, but you
would not let me go till I promised you I would give myself to the Lord.
I thought, "Now I must not lie to that woman," and I did what I promised
right there, and I have kept serving him ever since.'"

Such evidences of souls renewed is worth a life of even such
self-sacrifice as this brave woman lives. Like testimony could be gathered
of many of these A.M.A. missionaries.

DEATH OF PROF. A. HATCH.

We are called with sadness to chronicle the death of another of our
noble Christian workers at the South. Prof. Azel Hatch, the Principal of
our Normal School in Lexington, Ky., closed his earthly labors and
entered his heavenly rest on the 31st of December, 1888. His illness
began with a severe cold, but it was soon discovered that congestion of
the brain had set in, and the end rapidly came.

Prof. Hatch was born January 16, 1852, was educated at Oberlin College
and at the Union Theological Seminary in New York. He entered the
service of this Association in 1876, and has occupied honorable
positions in the schools at Montgomery, Ala., Tougaloo, Miss., and in
Lexington, Ky. In every post of duty, Mr. Hatch has shown himself to be
a faithful, conscientious and Christian worker, shrinking from no duty,
winning the confidence of the teachers and pupils, and showing adequate
results from his efficient labors. Mr. Hatch was reserved in manner, but
courteous and affable, and a man of spotless integrity and of entire
consecration to the work of the Master. It is a grief to record the
death of such faithful men, but it is a consolation to know that their
work was done and well done. The Christian life is not measured by its
length, but by the discharge of the duties allotted by the Heavenly
Father.

CONVENTION OF COLORED ROMAN CATHOLICS.

"A National Convention of Colored Roman Catholics, composed of delegates
from nearly all the colored Roman Catholic churches and societies in the
country, began its sessions on the morning of January 1st, in the St.
Augustine Colored Catholic Church in Washington. Every seat was occupied
when Father Tolton, of Quincy, Ill., the only colored Catholic priest in
the United States, began the celebration of solemn High Mass.
Immediately in front of and beneath the pulpit sat his Eminence,
Cardinal Gibbons, who delivered the sermon. He was clad in scarlet
robes. At the conclusion of the sermon, the Cardinal welcomed the
delegates in his own name, and in the name of the clergy and of the
congregation. He said:

"'This gathering will mark an era in the history of the colored people
of the United States, for never before have colored Catholics of the
country met in convention.' He suggested that the convention discuss the
education of the children--the religious education necessary to the life
of the Republic. _The universal level of the Catholic Church--its
equality--was eloquently dilated upon, and attention was directed to the
fact that a colored priest had celebrated mass in company with two white
clergymen._"

We quote the above from the _People's Advocate_, a paper published in
Washington, D.C., by colored editors and in the interests of the colored
people. In comments upon the above report, it adds:

"The presence of a Negro priest of pure lineage, born a slave, ordained
at Rome, Augustus Tolton--the property of Stephen Elliot, as the record
stands in the Vatican--the appearance of Cardinal Gibbons in his
official robes to sanction the meeting, his eloquent reference to the
universality of the Church of Rome that 'knows neither North, South,
East or West; that knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek, Barbarian nor
Scythian,' may mislead the unwary as to the real object of the movement.
Its real purpose is to propagate the Roman Catholic faith among the
colored people. So far as this meeting will secure from white
Protestants a greater interest in, and a more Christian recognition of,
the Negro as an equal participant in the Gospel plan, we regard it as
Providential. We are not ready to concede that the Roman Catholic Church
has been the friend of freedom, of education, of human rights and of
progress. We do not see that anything is gained by claiming for Roman
Catholicism to-day, or in the past, what is clearly not so. But the
Roman Catholic Church has placed itself squarely on the doctrine of the
Gospel as taught by Christ upon the question of universal brotherhood.
Prejudiced as many may be by long years of training against the tenets
of this church, all must acknowledge that this practice of the Romanists
as manifested in the presence of a black man on terms of perfect
equality, officiating at the altar of St. Augustine's Church, assisted
on his right and left by white priests, in the presence of his Eminence
Cardinal Gibbons, will be put in striking contrast with that of the
white American Protestant churches who are willing on every occasion to
sacrifice the Negro to secure the co-operation of the South on other
than Gospel terms."

       *       *       *       *       *

Rev. George W. Moore, of the Lincoln Memorial Congregational Church, at
Washington, to whom we are indebted for a full account of the sessions
of the Congress, comments upon it as follows:

"Mr. D.A. Rudd, of Cincinnati, editor of the _American Catholic
Tribune_, a colored Catholic paper, was chosen permanent Chairman. Upon
assuming the office he spoke favorably of the attitude of the Catholic
Church towards the Negro, saying especially: 'The Fatherhood of God and
the brotherhood of man is taught and practised by the Catholic Church in
no doubtful terms.' He advocated the starting of Catholic schools and
the aiding of those already started. The following facts were presented
by the Committee on Resolutions: There are twenty colored Roman Catholic
churches in the country, each of which has a school annexed. There are
sixty-five other colored Roman Catholic schools; eight colored Roman
Catholic orphan asylums; and three reformatories. Five thousand colored
children are taught in these schools, and three hundred children in the
asylums. Seven colored students are preparing to become priests. The
Pope from Rome cabled his greetings in response to a cable from the
Congress, saying: 'The Sovereign Pontiff gladly and proudly blesses you
with all his heart.' The influence, patronage and wealth of the Roman
Catholic Church are all at the service of this movement, and if
Protestants build up caste-churches in the South, the Romanists will
not."

my usual work--that of preaching to the colored people. I have preached
here about two weeks, the attendance being good, and the interest
deepening as the meetings went on, until now we have more than a score
who have professed to find Jesus precious to their souls.

The condition of the natives in this vicinity is very sad. Their
ignorance and pride coupled make it almost impossible to do anything for
them. The rough roads over the rocks and mountains make it a dangerous
undertaking for them to attend church in the evenings. Several of us
started for a meeting among them on a recent Saturday afternoon, with
rubbers, umbrellas and waterproofs, prepared for mud and rain. We
crossed a rickety old wooden bridge that had been nearly washed away by
the floods, and commenced to climb the mountain side by a road that was
nearly as steep as a steeple and which wended around to nearly every
point of the compass, ever going up, over ruts and rocks, roots and
trunks of trees, now jumping across a ravine, and next climbing a fence.
At last among the thickets and brush there were some signs of life, and
we came to an opening among the trees where we saw a miserable-looking
old shanty. The first thought was, can it be possible that human beings
live in a shed like this? We drew near and saw two women sitting with
their knees up to the open fire on the hearth. They looked much
surprised to see us. We told them that we were going to hold a meeting
at a house a little farther on; will they go? No, they don't care to go,
expectorating the tobacco juice from their mouths into the fire at the
same time. We replied, "You would better go; it may be you will never
have a chance to hear an Englishman again;" to which we got a reply,
"Hear a w-h-a-a-t?" Whether they knew what an Englishman was, or not, or
even if they ever heard there was such a country as England I cannot
say; but I understand there are thousands of these people who know
nothing of the outside world, and many who were never five miles away
from their own door-step in their life. With a patch of ground for corn,
another for tobacco, with wood for the fire, they are as contented as
the President; alas, too contented!

We entered the cabin to which we were going by a door-way in which we
must needs bend our heads very low to get inside. The first thing that
struck us was the gloom and darkness. In each corner of the room was a
bed, with a smaller one pushed underneath, and two sick people suffering
from slow fever. It is no wonder, for eleven people occupied this one
room, about twelve feet square. Need we wonder that misery and squalor
are seen all around? An old soap box from the grocery formed a corner
cupboard. Two old chairs which perhaps belonged to their
great-grandmother, all frame and no seat, an empty box, and a bucket of
water with a tin scoop, formed the whole furniture of the mountain cabin.
Poor souls! I was told that I had done wonders when one day, during an
address, I got them to smile! It was quite a treat to see a smile upon
their faces. Joy seems to be outside their domain altogether, and the
worst feature appears to be that they have no desire for anything
different. If they get the idea that you think them low down and want to
lift them up, they at once commence to stretch themselves up to their
full height and stand upon their dignity. They will not fail to tell you
plainly that you must not think they belong to the "know-nothing" class.
They "know what is right and what is wrong, without you coming here."
This is often said, even by those who live immoral lives. Pride of race
is often affected towards the colored people. A colored man
unfortunately had been drinking and was left at the depot. Some one
stumbled against him, saying, "I did not know it was a man; I thought it
was baggage." His companion spoke up and said, "It isn't a man; it's a
nigger." Often their children are bright, cheery-looking children,
well-behaved, unassuming and quiet. These poor mountain people might do
well to take a few lessons from many of their despised, dusky neighbors.

The whole work, in my little time among these people, has greatly
touched my heart and drawn out my sympathies towards them.

ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.


Trinity School, Athens, Ala.:

"During December there was a special religious interest in view of the
meetings held by Rev. Mr. Wharton, your missionary evangelist. The
meetings were well attended by our students and by the people. These
meetings were greatly blessed to the quickening and upbuilding of
Christians, and twelve persons professed conversion. All of our pupils
except one, above the primary department, are professing Christians. Our
student prayer meetings are exceedingly precious seasons to teachers and
pupils. We have just organized a Young People's Society of Christian
Endeavor which promises to be very helpful.

"On account of these meetings we could not make our usual preparations
for a Christmas concert and presents to the children. Accordingly, we
invited them all to our parlors to a reception on Wednesday the 26th,
and to our great surprise, there came a Christmas box on Tuesday, with
presents for every one, greatly to the joy of the little ones, yes, and
of the large ones also. After the distribution of the gifts, delightful
music bubbled from every throat, and the universal testimony was, 'This
is the best Christmas I ever spent.'"

Straight University, New Orleans, La.:

"We are having a glorious revival. Every night during the Week of Prayer
there have been glad hearts. I think there is scarcely a boarding
student who is not thoroughly aroused. Most are seeking the Saviour.
Eighteen have found peace. Many day students, and others who are not
students, have been much interested. One young man who has been a
scoffer at all good things, came to the meetings, and soon came under
the influence and asked us to pray for him. As I write in Stone Hall, I
hear on all sides the sound of prayer and singing."

The new church at Crossville, Tenn., was dedicated on Sunday, Dec. 30th.
The new building is very tasteful and convenient, in a beautiful and
central location. Six new members were received--all Northern people.
The house was full both morning and evening. Much interest was shown.
Rev. G.S. Pope preached in the morning and Rev. S.E. Lathrop in the
evening.

Sherwood Academy opened its new winter term with increasing numbers. The
school is gaining favor with all classes and is doing an excellent work.

"Habits and Manners," is the title of a neat little volume by Mrs. W.A.
Armstrong, of Hampton, Va. It is made up of the lectures delivered by
Mrs. Armstrong to the students of the Institution, and is a remarkably
clear statement of the rules that should govern the habits and manners
of ladies and gentlemen. These lectures, though originally addressed to
colored students, are equally applicable to white people, for here, at
least, color makes no difference. The book has many other items of
interest, as for example, rules for cooking, recipes, etc.

THE CHINESE.

       *       *       *       *       *


A GLIMPSE AT SHADY SIDE.

REV. W.C. POND, D.D.

Our friends will get a quite one-sided and mistaken view of our work
among the Chinese, as of any other missionary work, if they have nothing
but the sunny-side reports to read. It is a war that we are waging, and
war is serious business. The varied fortune of the battle involves
defeats, incidental and temporary, on the way to the final victory.
Sometimes it is hope deferred.

There are Chinese in whom we have come to be deeply interested, for whom
we have long prayed, who have for years been among the most constant and
most pleasing of our pupils, and for years have been convinced that an
idol is nothing, but that the God of the Bible is the only true God, and
the Christ of the Gospel the only true Saviour, who stop just there.
Over and over again we ask about them, only to find them still _just
there_. Not a step forward seems to have been taken, and meanwhile
time--weeks that grow to months, and months that grow even to years--
time that might be full of service, runs to waste. The heart gets sick
with this hope deferred.

Then there are cases of disappointment. Bright hopes have darkened
almost to the blackness of very despair. A brother whose conversion,
(_must_ I say _apparent_ conversion?) has seemed to be unusually clear;
whose walk as a Christian seemed, while he was with us, to be well-nigh
perfect; whose spirit was singularly humble, devout and Christly; who
was growing rapidly in knowledge of the word, and could already preach
the word with power, goes back to his home in China. Sore pressure is
brought to bear upon him, and he pays some sort of homage at an idol's
shrine. He feels forthwith condemned. He will not be a hypocrite, and
therefore will no longer profess to be a Christian. Now that he has
returned to California, he is ashamed, he says, to show himself among
the brethren. He stands aloof; keeps out of sight, and thus takes the
very path along which Judas hastened to his doom. In vain do we show him
the better way of faith; in vain speak to him of Peter, or of the
Father's welcome to the prodigal, and the delight we once had in him
adds soreness to the heartache of our disappointed hope.

These are not solitary cases. Yet we may thank God that they represent
not the general rule, but the exceptions. The general rule is that of
constancy and faithfulness, and these exceptions are such as occurred
even in the Apostolic ministries: how much more to be expected in ours!
Yet the pain they bring and the shadow they cast are none the less real
and deep.

Another element in shady side arises in a quite different quarter.
"Coming events cast their shadows before," and these shadows just now
obscure our sunny side. We resolve not to be worried about to-morrow,
and yet we must not enter doors that open except we first count the
cost. That coming event is a deficit that seems inevitable, unless we
shut our ears to what sound like the calls of God. Our plan heretofore
has been to listen to these calls and answer them if possible, believing
that he who gives the commission will not fail to supply the means. Nor
has this faith been put to shame. Yet, when the rules of arithmetic
confront one at every summing of his probable resources and subtracting
of his fixed expenditures, and the figures, like fleshless, bony
fingers, point him to deficits and unpaid bills impending, then, even
while faith maintains her hold, it cannot be denied that shadows cross
our path. Our friends who have helped us hitherto must expect some
urgent appeals before this fiscal year is ended. The utmost economy
shall be practised. Each dollar shall be made to do full service, if
care and watchfulness on our part can assure this, but the work must not
be hindered. Souls are at stake, priceless and immortal.

I have not yet reached the end of my catalogue of shadows, but I soon
tire of looking at the shady side. Shadow pre-supposes sunshine, and
sunshine there is, clear, abundant, having cheer in it for the present
and promise for the future--promise of harvests such as may make this
year to be as the last and even more abundant.

ANNIVERSARY OF CHINESE MISSIONS.

Superintendent Dr. Pond is a modest man, and we, therefore, take the
liberty of quoting from the _Congregationalist_ a little sketch by our
friend Dr. Holbrook, of the recent anniversary of the Chinese Mission as
presenting a broad ray of sunshine over the "Shady Side," as given in
Brother Pond's candid article above.

     The Chinese Mission of the A.M.A. on the Pacific coast, under
     the superintendence of Rev. W.C. Pond, D.D., is very efficient
     and successful. Its thirteenth anniversary was held on Sunday
     evening, December 9, in the First Congregational Church in San
     Francisco, Prof. I.E. Dwinell presiding. The exercises by the
     Chinese converts indicated remarkable proficiency in the English
     language and in music, both in solos and choruses. Jee Gam, the
     first convert, and now employed by the courts as an interpreter,
     read an address on "The Congregational Association of Christian
     Chinese," of such merit in thought and language, that some
     doubted its originality, which, however, was vouched for by Dr.
     Pond. The writer sketched its origin in 1871 and the progress of
     the Association since, and said it had been the means of the
     conversion of more than 700 Chinese, and that it designs to send
     missionaries to China. It is self-supporting, though the
     expenditures during the year have been $9,619.50, of which
     $2,066 were for rent. Dr. Pond advocated the appointment of
     itinerant preachers to labor with the Chinese in the moving
     camps on the railroads. Rev. Dr. Barrows made a very effective
     appeal for funds, and a collection was taken. Dr. Pond certainly
     deserves great credit for his labors in this department, in
     addition to the pastorate of Bethany Church in San Francisco, in
     which there are a large number of Chinese.

We would suggest to all ladles connected with the auxiliaries of State
Missionary Unions, that funds for the American Missionary Association be
sent to us through the treasurers of the Union. Care, however, should be
taken to designate the money as for the American Missionary Association,
since _undesignated funds will not reach us_.

THE MOUNTAIN GIRLS.

But why the _girls_? Because the girls are immortal as well as the boys.
Because the girls in their education have been neglected far more than
the boys. Because the _girls_ are to be the _mothers_ of the next
generation.

That they are immortal, and capable of becoming and doing much in this
life would seem to be doubted even by their parents. The neglect of the
girls in their physical, mental, moral, and religious education, is
enough to draw pity even from the most stupid Christian.

Hundreds are put into field work from spring till autumn. They follow
the mule and "bull tongue." They wield the heavy hoe, sprouting newly
cleared land. They look after cattle on the ranges and the mountain
swine, and if these are needed for meat, kill and dress them as a man
would do. Said a woman the other day, "I wish I had as many dollars as I
have alone killed and dressed hogs." With parents the _boy_ means a
"heap" more than the _girl_. A boy can shoot deer and coon, fox and
rabbit, can build cabins, can keep school, and "seems" be a doctor or go
to Congress. With this impression, if anybody is clothed and sent to
school, it is the _boy_, while as a rule, the girl is poorly clad and
stays at home to do the boy's work, to make "craps," and grow up in
ignorance. If in berry time they can get a few dimes to buy a calico
dress and a pair of shoes, contentment settles over their faces.
Aspirations for anything better they have not, for an avenue leading to
a more hopeful life they have never dreamed of. To look into the future
there is nothing sunny or bright. Illiterate, they marry young some poor
fellow, and with no money they begin life, build their cabin home in the
timber land, girdle a few acres of the stately trees of oak and
chestnut, and there raise a family to take the same dark and gloomy view
of life the parents have had.

Must this condition of things continue, among a people, too, who are all
native born Americans, who have fair native abilities to become a power
for good if trained in Christian schools?

_Is it not time a special_ effort be made for these _girls_? They are
growing older. They will soon be the mothers of a new generation. With
illiterate mothers what will that generation be? Just what the present
generation now is. What will it be if these girls now growing up are
brought into a school like ours at Pleasant Hill? Here, if there can be
sufficient room and ample teaching force, they will be taught and
trained in a practical knowledge of all the duties of life, especially
in those of the household. If we educate and save the _girls_ we are
using the very lever needed to lift these hopeless and neglected
thousands living at our very doors, out of their degraded life and bring
them into the light of the 19th century, and qualify them to take
positions among the best women of the land.

The work for which I plead is full of encouragement and hope. It is not
in Africa. It is within one or two days' ride of the largest and most
wealthy churches of our country, those who love the Kingdom of Christ
and have sent, and are still sending, their thousands of dollars to the
ends of the earth, while these bright American girls are, by some
strange oversight, neglected at our very doors.

The American Missionary Association has undertaken a noble work among
them, and something has been accomplished, yet this good work has but
just begun. The grey dawn has only cast a few signs of daylight over the
mountains. To carry this work forward successfully in behalf of the
neglected girls, there should be, in a great natural center of
operations like Pleasant Hill, a spacious boarding hall with an
industrial department and home, for those girls. It should not be
stinted in size, but large, well-arranged, and well-equipped in all its
departments from the primary upwards, where they can be taught
everything a girl ought to learn, not only in books and in a Christian
life, but taught to sew, knit, darn stockings, to make good bread, and
keep house with order and neatness, and do everything needed to be done
in a Christian home. If the _native girls_ can come from their cabin
homes into such an institution and be thus thoroughly trained, the axe
is then laid at the very root of the tree of a squalid life of
illiteracy, and a life of Christian culture and hope comes in its place,
where Christian mothers throw angelic brightness over their households,
and families of children are trained to act well their part in this
great and growing nation. The institution I suggest, and for which I
must plead, should not only be large enough to accommodate girls near at
hand, but from other neighboring States who stand in need of such a home
and training. It should be a Bethel for these immortal waifs, a house of
bread, so well provided for as to take the poorest who cannot pay a cent
of their own expenses. On this base it will be doing the greatest and
grandest work possible for the two millions and a half who are scattered
as lost sheep over the mountains of our own land.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
