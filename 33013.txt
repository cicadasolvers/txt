PREFACE.


Observations extending over a period of twenty-five years, made at
Fungus Forays and kindred meetings where Mycologists assemble together,
has led to the conviction that familiarity with the Fungi and literature
pertaining thereto, of one country only, leads to a false impression as
to the significance of the term 'species.'

It conveys the idea that species are much more sharply defined than
proves to be the case, when the entire Fungus Flora of Europe is
included.

In all large genera common to European countries, the continental
species can be sandwiched between British species. Even in large genera
there are as a rule not more than eight or ten primary differentiating
specific characters present, and it is the constant correlation of two
or three of those primary characters that constitute a species, as
understood at the present day.

If two British species are characterised respectively by the marks 1, 2,
and 3, 4, then we find that two continental species belonging to the
same genus will be indicated by the characters 1, 3, and 2, 4,
respectively.

Primary specific characters should include only those features that are
constant, and not materially modified by geographical or exceptional
local conditions as to environment, etc., and such alone should
constitute a specific diagnosis. Trivial or local characteristics should
follow the essential diagnosis as a rider.

With the introduction of characters due to local conditions, a
description ceases to be a specific diagnosis in the proper sense, and
is merely a description of a certain state of a species occurring under
a given set of conditions. Such, however, is too frequently the nature
of so-called specific characters given in local Floras.

A lengthy and laboured description suggests lack of power to grip
essentials on the part of the compiler, and does not as a rule
facilitate the recognition of the species intended.

The idea of this work is to give the essential characters of each
species as presented by pileus, gills, stem and spores respectively.
This, however, owing to the views of some authors as to the predominant
value of one feature to the exclusion of others, has not always been
possible. For this reason the species of Britzelmayr are not included,
as his descriptions, even when aided by what are presumably intended as
figures, could not in many instances be construed into an intelligible
diagnosis.

In Cooke and Quelet's _Clavis Synoptica Hymenomycetum Europaeorum_
(1878), 1943 species of Agarics are recorded as European, and of these
939 are given as British. The present work includes descriptions of 2750
European species, of which 1553 are British, a number considerably in
excess of that recorded for the species of any other European country.

The species indicated by brackets have not been recorded as British.

AGARICACEAE, Fries.


Hymenium covering the entire surface of radiating lamellae or gills.
Spores one-celled.

Primary divisions of the Agaricaceae depend on the colour of the spores
as seen in the mass, when deposited on an opaque substance; and not as
seen under the microscope by transmitted light.

     I. LEUCOSPORAE.

Spores white. In some cases with a tinge of yellow or pink. In some
species of _Russula_ the spores are clear ochre, but such species belong
obviously to _Russula_ notwithstanding.

     II. CHLOROSPORAE.

Spores clear green or bluish-green.

     III. RHODOSPORAE.

Spores salmon-colour or pink.

     IV. OCHROSPORAE.

Spores ochraceous or rust-colour.

     V. MELANOSPORAE.

Spores black, blackish-brown, or black with a purple tinge.




LEUCOSPORAE.


     I. HAPLOPHYLLAE.

     shrivelling (not corky, woody, or rigid).

     + _Ring, or volva, or both present, or gills free._

=Amanita=. Volva and ring present. Gills usually free, rarely adnexed or
adnate. (Volva sometimes not evident round base of stem, but loose
patches on pileus prove its presence.)

=Amanitopsis=. Volva present, ring absent; gills free.

=Lepiota=. Ring present, volva absent; gills free. (In some sp. the
ring is imperfect, and in a few the gills are slightly attached.)

=Mycena=. Pileus slender, campanulate, usually striate, margin straight
and adpressed to stem when young.

=Collybia=. Pileus rather fleshy, more or less plane, margin incurved
when young; stem cartilaginous outside.

=Marasmius=. Tough, drying up and reviving when moistened; gills often
connected by veins.

     +++ _Gills decurrent._

=Lactarius=. Gills and flesh exuding milk when broken. (In some sp. the
gills are adnate.)

=Hygrophorus=. Gills thick at the base, edge acute, rather waxy, often
branched; pileus often hygrophanous. (In some sp. the gills are adnate
or even free.)

=Clitocybe=. Gills thin, pliant, sometimes powdered with the spores;
stem fibrous outside.

=Omphalia=. Gills thin, pliant, stem cartilaginous outside.

=Pleurotus=. Growing on wood. Stem lateral or excentric when present.

=Cantharellus=. Gills narrow, edge thick, rather waxy, forking.

=Arrhenia=. Gills reduced to very slight wrinkles or veins.

=Nyctalis=. Gills thick, edge blunt. Parasitic on fungi, or among dead
leaves, &c.

     ** TENACES. Coriaceous, corky, or woody, persistent, rigid when
     dry.

=Lentinus=. Pileus coriaceous; gills decurrent, edge toothed or eroded.

=Panus=. Pileus coriaceous; gills decurrent, edge quite entire.

=Xerotus=. Pileus coriaceous; gills forking, edge thick.

=Lenzites=. Horizontal, sessile, woody or corky; gills radiating from
behind.

     II. SCHIZOPHYLLAE.

CORRECTIONS.

=Armillaria focalis=, Fr. (p. 14), should be placed in the genus
_Lepiota_, following _L. naucina_, Fr., p. 11.

=Cortinarius subsimilis=, Fr. (p. 183), should be placed under the
section "_Gills olive or smoky_," p. 183.

=Cortinarius Karstenii=, Sacc. and Syd. This name should replace _Cort.
olivascens_, Karsten, p. 191. There is an earlier _Cort. olivascens_,
Fries, p. 183.




BIBLIOGRAPHY.


_The following short list of comparatively recent works indicates where
more detailed descriptions and illustrations of European Agarics may be
consulted._

     GENERAL WORKS, CONTAINING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE AGARICS OF MORE THAN
     ONE COUNTRY.

Hymenomycetes Europaei, sive Epicriseos Systematis Mycologici; Elias
Fries. Ed. II. Upsala, 1876.

(Although not of recent date, this work cannot be omitted, inasmuch as
it embodies the experience of over fifty years of continuous observation
on the part of the author, and is the sheet-anchor of the present
generation of mycologists. Written in Latin.)

Sylloge Fungorum omnium hucusque cognitorum; P. A. Saccardo. Vol. V.
Padua, 1887.

(Contains descriptions of all European Agarics up to date of
publication. Later discoveries are contained in various supplements.
Written in Latin.)

Rysslands, Finlands och den Skandinaviska halfoens Hattsvampar; P. A.
Karsten. Helsingfors, 1879.

(Descriptions of Russian, Finnish and Scandinavian Agarics, in Swedish.

fungi, descriptions of the Agarics of Germany, Austria and Switzerland,
in German.)

Flore Mycologique de la France et des Pays limitrophes; Lucien Quelet.
Paris, 1888.

(This is undoubtedly the best and latest work containing detailed
descriptions of the Basidiomycetes of Central and Western Europe. The
systematic arrangement is new and somewhat perplexing, and the index is
a terror. Written in French.)

     GREAT BRITAIN.

Illustrations of British Fungi; M. C. Cooke. London, 1881-1891.

(This is by far the most important, and at the same time the most
comprehensive series of coloured figures of Agarics ever published in
any country, including 1199 plates.)

Handbook of British Fungi; M. C. Cooke. London, 1883.

(This work is a second edition of Cooke's 'Handbook of British Fungi,'
London, 1871, and contains descriptions of all the figures given in the
'Illustrations of British Fungi.')

British Fungus-Flora; Geo. Massee. 4 vols. London, 1892-1895.

(The first three volumes include all the British Agarics up to date of
publication. In addition to a diagnosis of each species, critical notes
by Fries, Berkeley, Cooke and other mycologists are appended.)

1907 coloured plates, 8vo. In French.)

Figures peintes de Champignons de la France; L. Lucand, 1884-1889.

(A series of beautifully executed figures, mostly Agarics, on 425 plates
4to size. The number of copies was in the first instance very limited,
and prepared only for subscribers. No descriptive text; names and
synonyms given on the plates.)

     GERMANY.

Die Pilze Schlesiens; J. Schroeter. Breslau, 1889.

(This work constitutes Vol. III. part I. of Cohn's Kryptogamen-Flora von
Schlesien, and contains full descriptions of all Agarics indigenous to
Silesia. In German.)

     SWEDEN.

Icones selectae Hymenomycetum nondum delineatorum; Elias Fries.
Stockholm, 1867.

(An indispensable work to the student of the Agaricaceae, containing
descriptions and coloured figures of numerous species on 200 4to.
plates. Written in Latin.)

Fungi Tridentini novi, vel nondum delineati, descripti, et iconibus
illustrati; J. Bresadola. Tridenti, 1881-.

(This work contains very full descriptions of new or critical species,
mostly Agarics, which are illustrated in colour on 217 plates, 8vo.
Written in Latin. This work appears in parts at irregular intervals, and
is still going on.)

     ITALY.

Flore Mycologique Illustree. Les Champignons des Alpes-Maritimes; J. B.
Barla. Nice, 1888-1892.

(An excellent work, 4to size, containing coloured illustrations of new,
rare, or critical Agarics on 64 plates. In French.)

     HOLLAND.

Revision des Champignons tant superieurs qu'inferieurs trouves jusqu'a
ce jour dans les Pays-Bas; C. A. J. A. Oudemans. Amsterdam, 1893.

(Vol. I. of this work contains descriptions and valuable original
comments of all the Hymenomycetes, Gasteromycetes, and Hypodermei met
with in Holland. Written in French.)

=IMPORTANT BOTANICAL WORKS.=


_JACKSON, B. DAYDON._

=A Glossary of Botanic Terms=, with their derivation and accent. By
BENJAMIN DAYDON JACKSON, Secretary of the Linnean Society of London.
Crown 8vo. 6_s._ net.

     _Athenaeum._--"Every Botanist will praise this work."

     _Gardeners' Chronicle._--"A much needed glossary. Should find a
     place in every garden library."

     _Journal of Botany._--"Mr Jackson has supplied what was wanting."

     _Nature._--"Exceedingly valuable."

     _Science Gossip._--"No botanist can afford to dispense with this
     work."


_PERCIVAL, JOHN._

=Agricultural Botany: Theoretical and Practical.= By JOHN PERCIVAL,
M.A., F.L.S., Professor of Botany at the South-Eastern Agricultural
College, Wye. Crown 8vo, with 265 Illustrations by the Author. 7_s._
6_d._ net.

_Second Edition. Ready now._

     Incorporated in the text are 265 illustrations, and over three
     hundred experiments, which specially enhance the value of the book
     for schools and colleges where botany, agriculture, and
     horticulture are taught.

     _Nature._--"We have no hesitation in recommending it as _the_
     elementary handbook for the agricultural student. The chapters on
     weeds and on diseases of farm-plants are distinctly better than
     those in any previous English works dealing with agricultural
     botany."

     _Journal of Education._--"A book which supplies what has for a long
     time been felt as a serious want in the literature of agricultural
     textbooks.... The book could hardly have been better."


_MASSEE, GEORGE._

=A Text-Book of Plant Diseases=, caused by Cryptogamic Parasites. By
GEORGE MASSEE, F.L.S., Mycologist and Principal Assistant, Royal
Herbarium, Kew. With 92 Illustrations, drawn from Nature by the Author.
Crown 8vo. 5_s._ net.

     _Literature._--"The book deserves to become the leading English
     textbook on the subject."

     _Farmers' Gazette._--"The manual which Messrs Duckworth have so
     attractively brought out for Mr Massee is one of the best of its
     kind that has yet appeared."

Transcriber's Notes.


The printer used raised dots for the decimal point; they were changed to
periods.

The dagger symbol was used in the keys; I changed them to the plus sign.

There are many inconsistencies in the way words are abbreviated, the
hyphenation, the Latin word endings and the capitalization of names, as
well as the spelling in general; except where noted below, I left them
as is.

Changed "subq." to "subg." on page 11: "sp. subg. 6-7."

Changed comma to period after "rufous" on page 23: "p. tinged rufous."

Changed "peristently" to "persistently" on page 24: "persistently
reddish flesh colour."

Added missing period after "g" on page 30: "g. deep ochraceous."

Sometimes the abbreviation "sp." is missing when the spores are
described, such as page 31; I left them as is. Similarly, the
abbreviation "P." is sometimes missing when the pileus is described as
on page 50. I also left this as is.

Added period after "var" on page 36: "var. violacea."

Changed "striata" to "striate" on page 42: "striate at paler margin."

Changed comma to period in entry for haematopoda on page 45:
"Caespitose."

Changed "mik" to "milk" on page 45: "giving out milk when broken."

Changed period to comma after "lax" on page 49: "lax, campan. then exp."

Changed "hariolarum" to "hariolorum" on page 51: "Differs from C.
hariolorum."

Although it appears that "P." should be after "Acrid.", I left it as is
on page 56 in the entry for M. urens.

Changed "palllid" to "pallid" on page 56: "pallid then rufescent."

The upper limit on the size of the pileus for M. plancus is missing on
page 57. I inserted an ellipsis as a placeholder.

Added a period after "P" on page 57: (varicosus) "P. 1.5-3 cm."

Changed "sub-umb." to "subumb." on page 58: "subumb. lilac-brown."

The spore size for M. fuscopurpureus on page 57 was left as "4-3" even
though that must be in error.

Changed semi-colon to comma on page 72: "with white points upwards, 3-5
cm."

The authority for M. xerotoides was left as "Tr.", although "Fr." might
have been intended.

Replaced "]" with ")" on page 79: "(= _Clitocybe Marzuolus_, Bres.)."

The authority for C. hirneola var. undulata was missing on page 80; I
inserted "----." as a placeholder.

Inserted period after "s" on page 83: "s. 7-10 cm."

Changed "floccossly" to "floccosely" on page 85: "floccosely villose."

Changed "yelllow" to "yellow" on page 100: "white then livid yellow."

There are two entries for Cantharellus tubaeformis var. lutescens on
page 107. Although these are almost identical, I kept them both.

Changed comma to period on page 108: "plano-infundib."

Changed "p." to "P." on page 112: "P. thin, subdimidiate."

Changed "Quelet" to "Quelet" on page 116: "Quelet says."

Removed extra period after "then" on page 126: "P. campan. then exp."

Changed "D.C." to "D. C." on page 140: "lamellirugis, D. C."

Changed "verdegris" to "verdigris" on page 149: "tinged verdigris at
base." Also on page 175: "verdigris green."

Removed replaced hyphen with space on page 149: "apex naked."

Change "squarrosula" to "squarrulosa" on page 149: "squarrulosa, Karst."

Inserted period after "var" on page 156: "var. major, B. and Br."

Removed extra period after "campanulato" on page 161: "P.
campanulato-exp."

Inserted period after "g" on page 168: "g. slightly sinuate."

Changed "Hypholama" to "Hypholoma" on page 175: "Habit of Hypholoma
fasciculare."

Changed "Sub-genera" to "Subgenera" on page 177: "Key to the Subgenera."

Changed "sub-bulbous" to "subbulbous" on page 177 for consistency:
"subbulbous base." Also on page 197: "subbulbous base."

Changed "fucescent" to "fuscescent" on page 188: "fuscescent with a grey
bloom."

Inserted comma after "free" on page 230: "g. free, white then black."

Removed extra period after "in" on page 236: "in p. being globose."

Inserted periods after "Jacobasch" and ")" on page 238 for consistency:
"Jacobasch. (= _Cop. intermedius_ Gill.)."

Changed "+" to "x" on page 240: (Pallassii) "sp. 12 x 4."

Added missing ")" to close paragraph on page 246: "British Fungi.')"

Changed "caeseriata" to "caesariata" on page 251: "caesariata (Ino.),
154."

Changed "16" to "86" on page 256: "flaccida (Cli.), 86."

Moved period inside parentheses on page 256: "ephemerus (Copr.), 237."

Inserted missing page number in Index: "macrocephalus (Copr.), 234."

Changed "Amv." to "Ann." on page 261: "laevis (Ann.), 120."

Left inconsistent capitalization of "Var." and "var."

For the ASCII version, the following substitutions were made: a with
grave accent to a; ae ligature to ae; c with cedilla to c; e with
diaresis to e; e with acute accent to e; e with grave accent to e; o
with diaresis to o or oe depending on the context; u with diaresis to
ue; section symbol to # (used in keys); micro symbol to mu or deleted
depending on context; multiplication symbol to x.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
