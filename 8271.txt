Book 44 Acts
001:001 The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus
        began both to do and to teach,
001:002 until the day in which he was received up, after he had given
        commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom
        he had chosen.
001:003 To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered,
        by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days,
        and speaking about God's Kingdom.
001:004 Being assembled together with them, he charged them, "Don't depart
        from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father,
        which you heard from me.
001:005 For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized
        in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
001:006 Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord,
        are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
001:007 He said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons
        which the Father has set within his own authority.
001:008 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
        You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria,
        and to the uttermost parts of the earth."
001:009 When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was
        taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
001:010 While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went,
        behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,
001:011 who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking
        into the sky?  This Jesus, who was received up from you into
        the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going
        into the sky."
001:012 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet,
        which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
001:013 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room,
        where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James,
        Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son
        of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
001:014 All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer
        and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the mother
        of Jesus, and with his brothers.
001:015 In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
        (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
001:016 "Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled,
        which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David
        concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.
001:017 For he was numbered with us, and received his portion
        in this ministry.
001:018 Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness,
        and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his
        intestines gushed out.
001:019 It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in
        their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is,
        'The field of blood.'
001:020 For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his habitation
        be made desolate.  Let no one dwell therein;'{Psalm 69:25} and,
        'Let another take his office.'{Psalm 109:8}
001:021 "Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time
        that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
001:022 beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was
        received up from us, of these one must become a witness
        with us of his resurrection."
001:023 They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was
        surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
001:024 They prayed, and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men,
        show which one of these two you have chosen
001:025 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas
        fell away, that he might go to his own place."
001:026 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias,
        and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
002:001 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one
        accord in one place.
002:002 Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a
        mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
002:003 Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them,
        and one sat on each of them.
002:004 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak
        with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
002:005 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
        from every nation under the sky.
002:006 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together,
        and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking
        in his own language.
002:007 They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another,
        "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?
002:008 How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
002:009 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia,
        Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
002:010 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene,
        visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
002:011 Cretans and Arabians:  we hear them speaking in our languages
        the mighty works of God!"
002:012 They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another,
        "What does this mean?"
002:013 Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."
002:014 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
        and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you
        who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen
        to my words.
002:015 For these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only
        the third hour of the day{about 9:00 AM}.
002:016 But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:
002:017 'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour
        out my Spirit on all flesh.  Your sons and your daughters
        will prophesy.  Your young men will see visions.
        Your old men will dream dreams.
002:018 Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,
        I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
002:019 I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the
        earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
002:020 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
        before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
002:021 It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord
        will be saved.'{Joel 2:28-32}
002:022 "Men of Israel, hear these words!  Jesus of Nazareth,
        a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders
        and signs which God did by him in the midst of you,
        even as you yourselves know,
002:023 him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men,
        crucified and killed;
002:024 whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death,
        because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
002:025 For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face,
        For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
002:026 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.
        Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
002:027 because you will not leave my soul in Hades{or, Hell}, neither will
        you allow your Holy One to see decay.
002:028 You made known to me the ways of life.  You will make me full
        of gladness with your presence.'{Psalm 16:8-11}
002:029 "Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David,
        that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
        to this day.
002:030 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn
        with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body,
        according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit
        on his throne,
002:031 he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,
        that neither was his soul left in Hades{or, Hell}, nor did
        his flesh see decay.
002:032 This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
002:033 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having
        received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,
        he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
002:034 For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,
        'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,
002:035 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'{Psalm 110:1}
002:036 "Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has
        made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
002:037 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart,
        and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers,
        what shall we do?"
002:038 Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you,
        in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins,
        and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
002:039 For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all
        who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will
        call to himself."
002:040 With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying,
        "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
002:041 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized.
        There were added that day about three thousand souls.
002:042 They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship,
        in the breaking of bread, and prayer.
002:043 Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done
        through the apostles.
002:044 All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
002:045 They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them
        to all, according as anyone had need.
002:046 Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple,
        and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness
        and singleness of heart,
002:047 praising God, and having favor with all the people.  The Lord
        added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.
003:001 Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer,
        the ninth hour{3:00 PM}.
003:002 A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried,
        whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is
        called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who
        entered into the temple.
003:003 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked
        to receive gifts for the needy.
003:004 Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."
003:005 He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
003:006 But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have,
        that I give you.  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
        get up and walk!"
003:007 He took him by the right hand, and raised him up.
        Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
003:008 Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk.  He entered with them
        into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.
003:009 All the people saw him walking and praising God.
003:010 They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging
        for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple.
        They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had
        happened to him.
003:011 As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John,
        all the people ran together to them in the porch that is
        called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
003:012 When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Israel,
        why do you marvel at this man?  Why do you fasten your eyes on us,
        as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?
003:013 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers,
        has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up,
        and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined
        to release him.
003:014 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a
        murderer to be granted to you,
003:015 and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead,
        to which we are witnesses.
003:016 By faith in his name has his name made this man strong,
        whom you see and know.  Yes, the faith which is through him has
        given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
003:017 "Now, brothers{The word for "brothers" here may be also correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}, I know
        that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
003:018 But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets,
        that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
003:019 "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,
        so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence
        of the Lord,
003:020 and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,
003:021 whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things,
        which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.
003:022 For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The Lord God will raise
        up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.
        You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.
003:023 It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet
        will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'{Deuteronomy
        18:15,18-19}
003:024 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after,
        as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
003:025 You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God
        made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will
        all the families of the earth be blessed.'{Genesis 22:18; 26:4}
003:026 God, having raised up his servant, Jesus, sent him to you first,
        to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."
004:001 As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain
        of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,
004:002 being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed
        in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
004:003 They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day,
        for it was now evening.
004:004 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number
        of the men came to be about five thousand.
004:005 It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes
        were gathered together in Jerusalem.
004:006 Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander,
        and as many as were relatives of the high priest.
004:007 When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired,
        "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
004:008 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them,
        "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
004:009 if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a
        crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,
004:010 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel,
        that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified,
        whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand
        here before you whole.
004:011 He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders,
        which has become the head of the corner.'{Psalm 118:22}
004:012 There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any
        other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we
        must be saved!"
004:013 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived
        that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled.
        They recognized that they had been with Jesus.
004:014 Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could
        say nothing against it.
004:015 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
        they conferred among themselves,
004:016 saying, "What shall we do to these men?  Because indeed a notable
        miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen
        by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.
004:017 But so that this spreads no further among the people,
        let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak
        to anyone in this name."
004:018 They called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor
        teach in the name of Jesus.
004:019 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right
        in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God,
        judge for yourselves,
004:020 for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."
004:021 When they had further threatened them, they let them go,
        finding no way to punish them, because of the people;
        for everyone glorified God for that which was done.
004:022 For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed
        was more than forty years old.
004:023 Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported
        all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
004:024 When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with
        one accord, and said, "O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven,
        the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
004:025 who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do
        the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
004:026 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers
        take council together, against the Lord, and against
        his Christ{Christ (Greek) and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean
        Anointed One.}.'{Psalm 2:1-2}
004:027 "For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom
        you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles
        and the people of Israel, were gathered together
004:028 to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.
004:029 Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants
        to speak your word with all boldness,
004:030 while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders
        may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."
004:031 When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
        gathered together.  They were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
        and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
004:032 The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul.
        Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which
        he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.
004:033 With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the
        resurrection of the Lord Jesus.  Great grace was on them all.
004:034 For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many
        as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought
        the proceeds of the things that were sold,
004:035 and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made
        to each, according as anyone had need.
004:036 Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is,
        being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man
        of Cyprus by race,
004:037 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it
        at the apostles' feet.
005:001 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife,
        sold a possession,
005:002 and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it,
        and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
005:003 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart
        to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price
        of the land?
005:004 While you kept it, didn't it remain your own?
        After it was sold, wasn't it in your power?
        How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart?
        You haven't lied to men, but to God."
005:005 Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died.
        Great fear came on all who heard these things.
005:006 The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him
        out and buried him.
005:007 About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what
        had happened, came in.
005:008 Peter answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."
        She said, "Yes, for so much."
005:009 But Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed
        together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?  Behold, the feet
        of those who have buried your husband are at the door,
        and they will carry you out."
005:010 She fell down immediately at his feet, and died.
        The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried
        her out and buried her by her husband.
005:011 Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who
        heard these things.
005:012 By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among
        the people.  They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
005:013 None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.
005:014 More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both
        men and women.
005:015 They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid
        them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by,
        at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.
005:016 Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem,
        bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by
        unclean spirits:  and they were all healed.
005:017 But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him
        (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were
        filled with jealousy,
005:018 and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.
005:019 But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night,
        and brought them out, and said,
005:020 "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
        of this life."
005:021 When they heard this, they entered into the temple
        about daybreak, and taught.  But the high priest came,
        and those who were with him, and called the council together,
        and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent
        to the prison to have them brought.
005:022 But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison.
        They returned and reported,
005:023 "We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing
        before the doors, but when we opened them, we found
        no one inside!"
005:024 Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief
        priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them
        and what might become of this.
005:025 One came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison
        are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."
005:026 Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them
        without violence, for they were afraid that the people
        might stone them.
005:027 When they had brought them, they set them before the council.
        The high priest questioned them,
005:028 saying, "Didn't we strictly charge you not to teach in this name?
        Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching,
        and intend to bring this man's blood on us."
005:029 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God
        rather than men.
005:030 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed,
        hanging him on a tree.
005:031 God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior,
        to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
005:032 We are His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit,
        whom God has given to those who obey him."
005:033 But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart,
        and determined to kill them.
005:034 But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel,
        a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded
        to put the apostles out for a little while.
005:035 He said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning
        these men, what you are about to do.
005:036 For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out
        to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred,
        joined themselves:  who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,
        were dispersed, and came to nothing.
005:037 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days
        of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him.
        He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him,
        were scattered abroad.
005:038 Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone.
        For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.
005:039 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it,
        and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"
005:040 They agreed with him.  Summoning the apostles, they beat
        them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus,
        and let them go.
005:041 They therefore departed from the presence of the council,
        rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor
        for Jesus' name.
005:042 Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped
        teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.
006:001 Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying,
        a complaint arose from the Hellenists{The Hellenists used
        Greek language and culture, even though they were also of
        Hebrew descent.} against the Hebrews, because their widows
        were neglected in the daily service.
006:002 The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said,
        "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God
        and serve tables.
006:003 Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report,
        full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint
        over this business.
006:004 But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry
        of the word."
006:005 These words pleased the whole multitude.
        They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the
        Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas,
        and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;
006:006 whom they set before the apostles.  When they had prayed,
        they laid their hands on them.
006:007 The word of God increased and the number of the disciples
        multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly.  A great company
        of the priests were obedient to the faith.
006:008 Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders
        and signs among the people.
006:009 But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines,"
        and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of
        Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.
006:010 They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit
        by which he spoke.
006:011 Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him
        speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
006:012 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes,
        and came against him and seized him, and brought him in
        to the council,
006:013 and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops
        speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
006:014 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will
        destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses
        delivered to us."
006:015 All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him,
        saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
007:001 The high priest said, "Are these things so?"
007:002 He said, "Brothers and fathers, listen.  The God of glory
        appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
        before he lived in Haran,
007:003 and said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives,
        and come into a land which I will show you.'{Genesis 12:1}
007:004 Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran.
        From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land,
        where you are now living.
007:005 He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
        his foot on.  He promised that he would give it to him
        for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still
        had no child.
007:006 God spoke in this way:  that his seed would live as aliens in a
        strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated
        for four hundred years.
007:007 'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,'
        said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me
        in this place.'{Genesis 15:13-14}
007:008 He gave him the covenant of circumcision.  So Abraham became
        the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day.
        Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father
        of the twelve patriarchs.
007:009 "The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him
        into Egypt.  God was with him,
007:010 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave
        him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
        He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
007:011 Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan,
        and great affliction.  Our fathers found no food.
007:012 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent
        out our fathers the first time.
007:013 On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers,
        and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.
007:014 Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all
        his relatives, seventy-five souls.
007:015 Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,
007:016 and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb
        that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children
        of Hamor of Shechem.
007:017 "But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn
        to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
007:018 until there arose a different king, who didn't know Joseph.
007:019 The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers,
        and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they
        wouldn't stay alive.
007:020 At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome.
        He was nourished three months in his father's house.
007:021 When he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up,
        and reared him as her own son.
007:022 Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.
        He was mighty in his words and works.
007:023 But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
        his brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where the context
        allows may be also correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."}, the children of Israel.
007:024 Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
        him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
007:025 He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand,
        was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.
007:026 "The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged
        them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers.
        Why do you wrong one another?'
007:027 But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying,
        'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
007:028 Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'{Exodus
        2:14}
007:029 Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land
        of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
007:030 "When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared
        to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire
        in a bush.
007:031 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight.  As he came close
        to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
007:032 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
        of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'{Exodus 3:6} Moses trembled,
        and dared not look.
007:033 The Lord said to him, 'Take your sandals off of your feet,
        for the place where you stand is holy ground.
007:034 I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt,
        and have heard their groaning.  I have come down to deliver them.
        Now come, I will send you into Egypt.'{Exodus 3:5,7-8,10}
007:035 "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler
        and a judge?'--God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer
        by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
007:036 This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt,
        in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
007:037 This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, 'The Lord
        our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers,
        like me.{TR adds "You shall listen to him."}'{Deuteronomy 18:15}
007:038 This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel
        that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers,
        who received living oracles to give to us,
007:039 to whom our fathers wouldn't be obedient, but rejected him,
        and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
007:040 saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will go before us,
        for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt,
        we don't know what has become of him.'{Exodus 32:1}
007:041 They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol,
        and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
007:042 But God turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky,
        as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer
        to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness,
        O house of Israel?
007:043 You took up the tent of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan,
        the figures which you made to worship.  I will carry you
        away{Amos 5:25-27} beyond Babylon.'
007:044 "Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness,
        even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it
        according to the pattern that he had seen;
007:045 which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua
        when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God
        drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,
007:046 who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find
        a habitation for the God of Jacob.
007:047 But Solomon built him a house.
007:048 However, the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,
        as the prophet says,
007:049 'heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet.
        What kind of house will you build me?' says the Lord;
        'or what is the place of my rest?
007:050 Didn't my hand make all these things?'{Isaiah 66:1-2}
007:051 "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
        you always resist the Holy Spirit!  As your fathers did,
        so you do.
007:052 Which of the prophets didn't your fathers persecute?
        They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One,
        of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
007:053 You received the law as it was ordained by angels,
        and didn't keep it!"
007:054 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
        and they gnashed at him with their teeth.
007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly
        into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
        on the right hand of God,
007:056 and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man
        standing at the right hand of God!"
007:057 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
        and rushed at him with one accord.
007:058 They threw him out of the city, and stoned him.
        The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young
        man named Saul.
007:059 They stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus,
        receive my spirit!"
007:060 He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, don't hold
        this sin against them!"  When he had said this, he fell asleep.
008:001 Saul was consenting to his death.  A great persecution arose
        against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day.
        They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea
        and Samaria, except for the apostles.
008:002 Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.
008:003 But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house,
        and dragged both men and women off to prison.
008:004 Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around
        preaching the word.
008:005 Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed
        to them the Christ.
008:006 The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that
        were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs
        which he did.
008:007 For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them.
        They came out, crying with a loud voice.  Many who had been
        paralyzed and lame were healed.
008:008 There was great joy in that city.
008:009 But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice
        sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria,
        making himself out to be some great one,
008:010 to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest,
        saying, "This man is that great power of God."
008:011 They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed
        them with his sorceries.
008:012 But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning
        the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
        both men and women.
008:013 Simon himself also believed.  Being baptized, he continued
        with Philip.  Seeing signs and great miracles occurring,
        he was amazed.
008:014 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
        had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,
008:015 who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they
        might receive the Holy Spirit;
008:016 for as yet he had fallen on none of them.  They had only been
        baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.
008:017 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received
        the Holy Spirit.
008:018 Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through
        the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
008:019 saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands
        on may receive the Holy Spirit."
008:020 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you,
        because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
008:021 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart
        isn't right before God.
008:022 Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps
        the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
008:023 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in
        the bondage of iniquity."
008:024 Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things
        which you have spoken happen to me."
008:025 They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word
        of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News
        to many villages of the Samaritans.
008:026 But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go
        toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
        This is a desert."
008:027 He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia,
        a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of
        the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come
        to Jerusalem to worship.
008:028 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading
        the prophet Isaiah.
008:029 The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself
        to this chariot."
008:030 Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet,
        and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
008:031 He said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?"
        He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.
008:032 Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,
        "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.  As a lamb before
        his shearer is silent, so he doesn't open his mouth.
008:033 In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away.
        Who will declare His generation?  For his life is taken
        from the earth."{Isaiah 53:7,8}
008:034 The eunuch answered Philip, "Who is the prophet talking about?
        About himself, or about someone else?"
008:035 Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture,
        preached to him Jesus.
008:036 As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the
        eunuch said, "Behold, here is water.  What is keeping me
        from being baptized?"
008:037 {TR adds "Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may.'
        He answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'"}
008:038 He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both
        went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch,
        and he baptized him.
008:039 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
        caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him any more,
        for he went on his way rejoicing.
008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus.  Passing through, he preached
        the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
009:001 But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against
        the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
009:002 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus,
        that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women,
        he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
009:003 As he traveled, it happened that he got close to Damascus,
        and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him.
009:004 He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him,
        "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
009:005 He said, "Who are you, Lord?"  The Lord said, "I am Jesus,
        whom you are persecuting.{TR adds "It's hard for you to kick
        against the goads."}
009:006 But{TR omits "But" } rise up, and enter into the city,
        and you will be told what you must do."
009:007 The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound,
        but seeing no one.
009:008 Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened,
        he saw no one.  They led him by the hand, and brought
        him into Damascus.
009:009 He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.
009:010 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias.
        The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!"  He said, "Behold,
        it's me, Lord."
009:011 The Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street
        which is called Straight, and inquire in the house
        of Judah{or, Judas} for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus.
        For behold, he is praying,
009:012 and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in,
        and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."
009:013 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man,
        how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.
009:014 Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call
        on your name."
009:015 But the Lord said to him, "Go your way, for he is my chosen
        vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings,
        and the children of Israel.
009:016 For I will show him how many things he must suffer for
        my name's sake."
009:017 Ananias departed, and entered into the house.  Laying his
        hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared
        to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you
        may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
009:018 Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes,
        and he received his sight.  He arose and was baptized.
009:019 He took food and was strengthened.  Saul stayed several days
        with the disciples who were at Damascus.
009:020 Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ,
        that he is the Son of God.
009:021 All who heard him were amazed, and said, "Isn't this he who
        in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name?
        And he had come here intending to bring them bound before
        the chief priests!"
009:022 But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews
        who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
009:023 When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together
        to kill him,
009:024 but their plot became known to Saul.  They watched the gates
        both day and night that they might kill him,
009:025 but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through
        the wall, lowering him in a basket.
009:026 When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to
        the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing
        that he was a disciple.
009:027 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles,
        and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way,
        and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had
        preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
009:028 He was with them entering into{TR and NU add "and
        going out"} Jerusalem,
009:029 preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.  He spoke and disputed
        against the Hellenists,{The Hellenists were Hebrews who used
        Greek language and culture.} but they were seeking to kill him.
009:030 When the brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where the context
        allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."} knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea,
        and sent him off to Tarsus.
009:031 So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria
        had peace, and were built up.  They were multiplied, walking in
        the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
009:032 It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts,
        he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
009:033 There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been
        bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.
009:034 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you.
        Get up and make your bed!"  Immediately he arose.
009:035 All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned
        to the Lord.
009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
        which when translated, means Dorcas.{"Dorcas" is Greek
        for "Gazelle."} This woman was full of good works and acts
        of mercy which she did.
009:037 It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died.
        When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
009:038 As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there,
        sent two men{Reading from NU, TR; MT omits "two men"} to him,
        imploring him not to delay in coming to them.
009:039 Peter got up and went with them.  When he had come, they brought
        him into the upper chamber.  All the widows stood by him weeping,
        and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made
        while she was with them.
009:040 Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed.
        Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!"
        She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
009:041 He gave her his hand, and raised her up.  Calling the saints
        and widows, he presented her alive.
009:042 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed
        in the Lord.
009:043 It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon,
        a tanner.
010:001 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name,
        a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,
010:002 a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house,
        who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people,
        and always prayed to God.
010:003 At about the ninth hour of the day{3:00 PM}, he clearly
        saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying
        to him, "Cornelius!"
010:004 He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said,
        "What is it, Lord?"  He said to him, "Your prayers and your
        gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.
010:005 Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter.
010:006 He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the
        seaside.{TR adds "This one will tell you what it is necessary
        for you to do."}"
010:007 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called
        two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those
        who waited on him continually.
010:008 Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
010:009 Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got
        close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray
        at about noon.
010:010 He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing,
        he fell into a trance.
010:011 He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him,
        like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,
010:012 in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth,
        wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.
010:013 A voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"
010:014 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything
        that is common or unclean."
010:015 A voice came to him again the second time, "What God has cleansed,
        you must not call unclean."
010:016 This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was
        received up into heaven.
010:017 Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision
        which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were
        sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house,
        stood before the gate,
010:018 and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter,
        was lodging there.
010:019 While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said
        to him, "Behold, three{Reading from TR and NU.
        MT omits "three"} men seek you.
010:020 But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing;
        for I have sent them."
010:021 Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek.
        Why have you come?"
010:022 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who
        fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews,
        was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house,
        and to listen to what you say."
010:023 So he called them in and lodged them.  On the next day Peter
        arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from
        Joppa accompanied him.
010:024 On the next day they entered into Caesarea.  Cornelius was
        waiting for them, having called together his relatives
        and his near friends.
010:025 When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him,
        fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.
010:026 But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up!  I myself am
        also a man."
010:027 As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.
010:028 He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful
        thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one
        of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call
        any man unholy or unclean.
010:029 Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for.
        I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"
010:030 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour,
        and at the ninth hour,{3:00 P. M.} I prayed in my house,
        and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
010:031 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts
        to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.
010:032 Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter.
        He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.
        When he comes, he will speak to you.'
010:033 Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come.
        Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God
        to hear all things that have been commanded you by God."
010:034 Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God
        doesn't show favoritism;
010:035 but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness
        is acceptable to him.
010:036 The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good
        news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
010:037 that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed
        throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism
        which John preached;
010:038 even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit
        and with power, who went about doing good and healing all
        who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
010:039 We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews,
        and in Jerusalem; whom they also{TR omits "also"} killed,
        hanging him on a tree.
010:040 God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,
010:041 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen
        before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose
        from the dead.
010:042 He charged us to preach to the people and to testify that this
        is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living
        and the dead.
010:043 All the prophets testify about him, that through his name
        everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."
010:044 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit
        fell on all those who heard the word.
010:045 They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many
        as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was
        also poured out on the nations.
010:046 For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.
        Then Peter answered,
010:047 "Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received
        the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"
010:048 He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
        Then they asked him to stay some days.
011:001 Now the apostles and the brothers{The word for "brothers"
        here and where context allows may also be correctly translated
        "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} who were in Judea
        heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
011:002 When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the
        circumcision contended with him,
011:003 saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"
011:004 But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,
011:005 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I
        saw a vision:  a certain container descending, like it
        was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners.
        It came as far as me.
011:006 When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the
        four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things,
        and birds of the sky.
011:007 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'
011:008 But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has
        ever entered into my mouth.'
011:009 But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven,
        'What God has cleansed, don't you call unclean.'
011:010 This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.
011:011 Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was,
        having been sent from Caesarea to me.
011:012 The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating.
        These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into
        the man's house.
011:013 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house,
        and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon,
        whose surname is Peter,
011:014 who will speak to you words by which you will be saved,
        you and all your house.'
011:015 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on
        us at the beginning.
011:016 I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed
        baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'
011:017 If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed
        in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"
011:018 When they heard these things, they held their peace,
        and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted
        to the Gentiles repentance to life!"
011:019 They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose
        about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch,
        speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.
011:020 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they
        had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists,{A Hellenist
        is someone who keeps Greek customs and culture.} preaching
        the Lord Jesus.
011:021 The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed
        and turned to the Lord.
011:022 The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly
        which was in Jerusalem.  They sent out Barnabas to go
        as far as Antioch,
011:023 who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad.
        He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should
        remain near to the Lord.
011:024 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith,
        and many people were added to the Lord.
011:025 Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.
011:026 When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.
        It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered
        together with the assembly, and taught many people.
        The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
011:027 Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
011:028 One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit
        that there should be a great famine all over the world,
        which also happened in the days of Claudius.
011:029 As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send
        relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;
011:030 which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands
        of Barnabas and Saul.
012:001 Now about that time, Herod the king stretched out his hands
        to oppress some of the assembly.
012:002 He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.
012:003 When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize
        Peter also.  This was during the days of unleavened bread.
012:004 When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered
        him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him,
        intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
012:005 Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer
        was made by the assembly to God for him.
012:006 The same night when Herod was about to bring him out,
        Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains.
        Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
012:007 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light
        shone in the cell.  He struck Peter on the side, and woke
        him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!"  His chains fell off
        from his hands.
012:008 The angel said to him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals."
        He did so.  He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."
012:009 And he went out and followed him.  He didn't know that what was
        being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.
012:010 When they were past the first and the second guard, they came
        to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened
        to them by itself.  They went out, and went down one street,
        and immediately the angel departed from him.
012:011 When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know
        that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me
        out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish
        people were expecting."
012:012 Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother
        of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered
        together and were praying.
012:013 When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda
        came to answer.
012:014 When she recognized Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate
        for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing
        in front of the gate.
012:015 They said to her, "You are crazy!"  But she insisted that it was so.
        They said, "It is his angel."
012:016 But Peter continued knocking.  When they had opened, they saw him,
        and were amazed.
012:017 But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent,
        declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
        He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers."
        Then he departed, and went to another place.
012:018 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among
        the soldiers about what had become of Peter.
012:019 When Herod had sought for him, and didn't find him, he examined
        the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death.
        He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.
012:020 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon.
        They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus,
        the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace,
        because their country depended on the king's country for food.
012:021 On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing,
        sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.
012:022 The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
012:023 Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn't
        give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
012:024 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
012:025 Barnabas and Saul returned to{TR reads "from" instead of
        "to"} Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service,
        also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
013:001 Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some
        prophets and teachers:  Barnabas, Simeon who was called
        Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod
        the tetrarch, and Saul.
013:002 As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said,
        "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I
        have called them."
013:003 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands
        on them, they sent them away.
013:004 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia.
        From there they sailed to Cyprus.
013:005 When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in
        the Jewish synagogues.  They had also John as their attendant.
013:006 When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found
        a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
        was Bar Jesus,
013:007 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding.
        This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear
        the word of God.
013:008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
        withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul
        from the faith.
013:009 But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit,
        fastened his eyes on him,
013:010 and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil,
        you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert
        the right ways of the Lord?
013:011 Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you
        will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!"
        Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him.  He went around
        seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
013:012 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed,
        being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
013:013 Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga
        in Pamphylia.  John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
013:014 But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia.
        They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.
013:015 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers
        of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you
        have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."
013:016 Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Israel,
        and you who fear God, listen.
013:017 The God of this people{TR, NU add "Israel"} chose our fathers,
        and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land
        of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.
013:018 For a period of about forty years he put up with them
        in the wilderness.
013:019 When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,
        he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four
        hundred fifty years.
013:020 After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
013:021 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son
        of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
013:022 When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king,
        to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse,
        a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'
013:023 From this man's seed, God has brought salvation{TR, NU read
        "a Savior, Jesus" instead of "salvation"} to Israel according
        to his promise,
013:024 before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of
        repentance to Israel.{TR, NU read "to all the people of Israel"
        instead of "to Israel"}
013:025 As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose
        that I am?  I am not he.  But behold, one comes after me
        the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
013:026 Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you
        who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.
013:027 For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
        didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read
        every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
013:028 Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate
        to have him killed.
013:029 When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him,
        they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
013:030 But God raised him from the dead,
013:031 and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him
        from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
013:032 We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,
013:033 that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that
        he raised up Jesus.  As it is also written in the second psalm,
        'You are my Son.  Today I have become your father.'{Psalm 2:7}
013:034 "Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more
        to return to corruption, he has spoken thus:  'I will give
        you the holy and sure blessings of David.'{Isaiah 55:3}
013:035 Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow
        your Holy One to see decay.'{Psalm 16:10}
013:036 For David, after he had in his own generation served the
        counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers,
        and saw decay.
013:037 But he whom God raised up saw no decay.
013:038 Be it known to you therefore, brothers{The word for "brothers"
        here and where the context allows may also be correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}, that through
        this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
013:039 and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things,
        from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken
        in the prophets:
013:041 'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work
        a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe,
        if one declares it to you.'"{Habakkuk 1:5}
013:042 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged
        that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
013:043 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout
        proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them,
        urged them to continue in the grace of God.
013:044 The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together
        to hear the word of God.
013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled
        with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken
        by Paul, and blasphemed.
013:046 Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was
        necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first.
        Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves
        unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
013:047 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you
        as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation
        to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"{Isaiah 49:6}
013:048 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word
        of God.  As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
013:049 The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.
013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women
        and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution
        against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.
013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them,
        and came to Iconium.
013:052 The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.
014:001 It happened in Iconium that they entered together into
        the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude
        both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
014:002 But the disbelieving{or, disobedient} Jews stirred up and
        embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.
014:003 Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly
        in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace,
        granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
014:004 But the multitude of the city was divided.  Part sided with
        the Jews, and part with the apostles.
014:005 When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers,
        made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,
014:006 they became aware of it, and fled to the cities
        of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.
014:007 There they preached the Good News.
014:008 At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple
        from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
014:009 He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him,
        and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,
014:010 said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!"
        He leaped up and walked.
014:011 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
        their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods
        have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
014:012 They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury,"
        because he was the chief speaker.
014:013 The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city,
        brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made
        a sacrifice along with the multitudes.
014:014 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore
        their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,
014:015 "Men, why are you doing these things?  We also are men
        of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you
        should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made
        the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;
014:016 who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk
        in their own ways.
014:017 Yet he didn't leave himself without witness, in that he did
        good and gave you{TR reads "us" instead of "you"} rains
        from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with
        food and gladness."
014:018 Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes
        from making a sacrifice to them.
014:019 But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having
        persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him
        out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
014:020 But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into
        the city.  On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
014:021 When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made
        many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
014:022 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue
        in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter
        into the Kingdom of God.
014:023 When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly,
        and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord,
        on whom they had believed.
014:024 They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
014:025 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
014:026 From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed
        to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
014:027 When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together,
        they reported all the things that God had done with them,
        and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.
014:028 They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.
015:001 Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers,
        "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses,
        you can't be saved."
015:002 Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord
        and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas,
        and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles
        and elders about this question.
015:003 They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both
        Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles.
        They caused great joy to all the brothers.{The word for "brothers"
        here and where the context allows may also be correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}
015:004 When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly
        and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things
        that God had done with them.
015:005 But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up,
        saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge
        them to keep the law of Moses."
015:006 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see
        about this matter.
015:007 When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said
        to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made
        a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear
        the word of the Good News, and believe.
015:008 God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them
        the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.
015:009 He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their
        hearts by faith.
015:010 Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke
        on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor
        we were able to bear?
015:011 But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the
        Lord Jesus,{TR adds "Christ"} just as they are."
015:012 All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas
        and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among
        the nations through them.
015:013 After they were silent, James answered, "Brothers, listen to me.
015:014 Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations,
        to take out of them a people for his name.
015:015 This agrees with the words of the prophets.  As it is written,
015:016 'After these things I will return.  I will again build the tent
        of David, which has fallen.  I will again build its ruins.
        I will set it up,
015:017 That the rest of men may seek after the Lord; All the Gentiles
        who are called by my name, Says the Lord, who does all
        these things.{Amos 9:11-12}
015:018 All his works are known to God from eternity.'
015:019 "Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among
        the Gentiles who turn to God,
015:020 but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution
        of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled,
        and from blood.
015:021 For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who
        preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
015:022 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the
        whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send
        them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas:  Judas called Barsabbas,
        and Silas, chief men among the brothers.{The word for "brothers"
        here and where the context allows may also be correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}
015:023 They wrote these things by their hand:  "The apostles, the elders,
        and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles
        in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:  greetings.
015:024 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled
        you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'You must be
        circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no commandment;
015:025 it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out
        men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
015:026 men who have risked their lives for the name of our
        Lord Jesus Christ.
015:027 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will
        also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
015:028 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay
        no greater burden on you than these necessary things:
015:029 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood,
        from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which
        if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you.  Farewell."
015:030 So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch.
        Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
015:031 When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
015:032 Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the
        brothers with many words, and strengthened them.
015:033 After they had spent some time there, they were sent back
        with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.
015:034 {Some manuscripts add:  But it seemed good to Silas to stay there.}
015:035 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching
        the word of the Lord, with many others also.
015:036 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's return now
        and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed
        the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."
015:037 Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark,
        with them also.
015:038 But Paul didn't think that it was a good idea to take
        with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia,
        and didn't go with them to do the work.
015:039 Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated
        from each other.  Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed
        away to Cyprus,
015:040 but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers
        to the grace of God.
015:041 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
016:001 He came to Derbe and Lystra:  and behold, a certain disciple
        was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed;
        but his father was a Greek.
016:002 The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good
        testimony about him.
016:003 Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and
        circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts;
        for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
016:004 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered
        the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by
        the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
016:005 So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased
        in number daily.
016:006 When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia,
        they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
016:007 When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia,
        but the Spirit didn't allow them.
016:008 Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
016:009 A vision appeared to Paul in the night.  There was a man
        of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over
        into Macedonia and help us."
016:010 When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out
        to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach
        the Good News to them.
016:011 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course
        to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
016:012 and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia,
        the foremost of the district, a Roman colony.  We were staying
        some days in this city.
016:013 On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside,
        where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down,
        and spoke to the women who had come together.
016:014 A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
        of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord
        opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.
016:015 When she and her household were baptized, she begged us,
        saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,
        come into my house, and stay."  So she persuaded us.
016:016 It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl
        having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters
        much gain by fortune telling.
016:017 Following Paul and us, she cried out, "These men are servants
        of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation!"
016:018 She was doing this for many days.  But Paul, becoming
        greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I charge
        you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!"
        It came out that very hour.
016:019 But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone,
        they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace
        before the rulers.
016:020 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said,
        "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,
016:021 and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept
        or to observe, being Romans."
016:022 The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates
        tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be
        beaten with rods.
016:023 When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them
        into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,
016:024 who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison,
        and secured their feet in the stocks.
016:025 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing
        hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
016:026 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations
        of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors
        were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.
016:027 The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison
        doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself,
        supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself,
        for we are all here!"
016:029 He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling
        before Paul and Silas,
016:030 and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
016:031 They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will
        be saved, you and your household."
016:032 They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were
        in his house.
016:033 He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes,
        and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.
016:034 He brought them up into his house, and set food before them,
        and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having
        believed in God.
016:035 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants,
        saying, "Let those men go."
016:036 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates
        have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
016:037 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly,
        without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison!
        Do they now release us secretly?  No, most certainly,
        but let them come themselves and bring us out!"
016:038 The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates,
        and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
016:039 and they came and begged them.  When they had brought them out,
        they asked them to depart from the city.
016:040 They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house.
        When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.
017:001 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
        they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
017:002 Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath
        days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
017:003 explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer
        and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus,
        whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
017:004 Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas,
        of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few
        of the chief women.
017:005 But the unpersuaded Jews took along{TR reads "And the Jews
        who were unpersuaded, becoming envious and taking along"
        instead of "But the unpersuaded Jews took along"} some
        wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd,
        set the city in an uproar.  Assaulting the house of Jason,
        they sought to bring them out to the people.
017:006 When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain
        brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where the context
        allows may be also correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."} before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who
        have turned the world upside down have come here also,
017:007 whom Jason has received.  These all act contrary to the decrees
        of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"
017:008 The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they
        heard these things.
017:009 When they had taken security from Jason and the rest,
        they let them go.
017:010 The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea.
        When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
017:011 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,
        in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind,
        examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
017:012 Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women,
        and not a few men.
017:013 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
        of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came
        there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
017:014 Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far
        as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.
017:015 But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens.
        Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should
        come to him very quickly, they departed.
017:016 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked
        within him as he saw the city full of idols.
017:017 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons,
        and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.
017:018 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also{TR omits
        "also"} were conversing with him.  Some said, "What does
        this babbler want to say?"  Others said, "He seems to be
        advocating foreign deities," because he preached Jesus
        and the resurrection.
017:019 They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus,
        saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is
        spoken by you?
017:020 For you bring certain strange things to our ears.
        We want to know therefore what these things mean."
017:021 Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent
        their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear
        some new thing.
017:022 Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said,
        "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious
        in all things.
017:023 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship,
        I found also an altar with this inscription:  'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'
        What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.
017:024 The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord
        of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,
017:025 neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything,
        seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.
017:026 He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all
        the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons,
        and the boundaries of their dwellings,
017:027 that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach
        out for him and find him, though he is not far from each
        one of us.
017:028 'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.'  As some
        of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'
017:029 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think
        that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone,
        engraved by art and design of man.
017:030 The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked.
        But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,
017:031 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge
        the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained;
        of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has
        raised him from the dead."
017:032 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked;
        but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."
017:033 Thus Paul went out from among them.
017:034 But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom
        also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
        and others with them.
018:001 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
018:002 He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race,
        who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla,
        because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome.
        He came to them,
018:003 and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them
        and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
018:004 He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded
        Jews and Greeks.
018:005 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was
        compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus
        was the Christ.
018:006 When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing
        and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads!  I am clean.
        From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"
018:007 He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man
        named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door
        to the synagogue.
018:008 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord
        with all his house.  Many of the Corinthians, when they heard,
        believed and were baptized.
018:009 The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Don't be afraid,
        but speak and don't be silent;
018:010 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you,
        for I have many people in this city."
018:011 He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word
        of God among them.
018:012 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord
        rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
018:013 saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary
        to the law."
018:014 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to
        the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime,
        you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;
018:015 but if they are questions about words and names and your own law,
        look to it yourselves.  For I don't want to be a judge
        of these matters."
018:016 He drove them from the judgment seat.
018:017 Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler
        of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat.
        Gallio didn't care about any of these things.
018:018 Paul, having stayed after this many more days,
        took his leave of the brothers,{The word for "brothers"
        here and where the context allows may also be correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} and sailed
        from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila.
        He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
018:019 He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself
        entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
018:020 When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;
018:021 but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means
        keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again
        to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.
018:022 When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly,
        and went down to Antioch.
018:023 Having spent some time there, he departed, and went
        through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order,
        establishing all the disciples.
018:024 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race,
        an eloquent man, came to Ephesus.  He was mighty in the Scriptures.
018:025 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
        fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things
        concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.
018:026 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.  But when Priscilla
        and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained
        to him the way of God more accurately.
018:027 When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers
        encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him.
        When he had come, he greatly helped those who had
        believed through grace;
018:028 for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by
        the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
019:001 It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul,
        having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus,
        and found certain disciples.
019:002 He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"
        They said to him, "No, we haven't even heard that there
        is a Holy Spirit."
019:003 He said, "Into what then were you baptized?"  They said,
        "Into John's baptism."
019:004 Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance,
        saying to the people that they should believe in the one
        who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."
019:005 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of
        the Lord Jesus.
019:006 When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them,
        and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.
019:007 They were about twelve men in all.
019:008 He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period
        of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things
        concerning the Kingdom of God.
019:009 But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of
        the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
        the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
019:010 This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia
        heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
019:011 God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,
019:012 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from
        his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.
019:013 But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves
        to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the
        Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
019:014 There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest,
        who did this.
019:015 The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know,
        but who are you?"
019:016 The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them,
        and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they
        fled out of that house naked and wounded.
019:017 This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus.
        Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
019:018 Many also of those who had believed came, confessing,
        and declaring their deeds.
019:019 Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their
        books together and burned them in the sight of all.
        They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty
        thousand pieces of silver.{The 50,000 pieces of silver
        here probably referred to 50,000 drachmas.  If so, the value
        of the burned books was equivalent to about 160 man-years
        of wages for agricultural laborers}
019:020 So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.
019:021 Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit,
        when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go
        to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must
        also see Rome."
019:022 Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him,
        Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
019:023 About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made
        silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business
        to the craftsmen,
019:025 whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation,
        and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.
019:026 You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout
        all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people,
        saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.
019:027 Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute,
        but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis
        will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed,
        whom all Asia and the world worships."
019:028 When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out,
        saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
019:029 The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one
        accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus,
        men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.
019:030 When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples
        didn't allow him.
019:031 Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him
        and begged him not to venture into the theater.
019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the
        assembly was in confusion.  Most of them didn't know why they
        had come together.
019:033 They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
        him forward.  Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would
        have made a defense to the people.
019:034 But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice
        for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis
        of the Ephesians!"
019:035 When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men
        of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city
        of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis,
        and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
019:036 Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought
        to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
019:037 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers
        of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
019:038 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him
        have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there
        are proconsuls.  Let them press charges against one another.
019:039 But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled
        in the regular assembly.
019:040 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this
        day's riot, there being no cause.  Concerning it, we wouldn't
        be able to give an account of this commotion."
019:041 When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
020:001 After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples,
        took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
020:002 When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them
        with many words, he came into Greece.
020:003 When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made
        against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria,
        he determined to return through Macedonia.
020:004 These accompanied him as far as Asia:  Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus
        and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy;
        and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
020:005 But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.
020:006 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread,
        and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
020:007 On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered
        together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart
        on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.
020:008 There were many lights in the upper chamber where we{TR reads "they"
        instead of "we"} were gathered together.
020:009 A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window,
        weighed down with deep sleep.  As Paul spoke still longer,
        being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story,
        and was taken up dead.
020:010 Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said,
        "Don't be troubled, for his life is in him."
020:011 When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten,
        and had talked with them a long while, even until break
        of day, he departed.
020:012 They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.
020:013 But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos,
        intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged,
        intending himself to go by land.
020:014 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.
020:015 Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios.
        The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium,
        and the day after we came to Miletus.
020:016 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not
        have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were
        possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
020:017 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders
        of the assembly.
020:018 When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know,
        from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you
        all the time,
020:019 serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears,
        and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;
020:020 how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that
        was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
020:021 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God,
        and faith toward our Lord Jesus.{TR adds "Christ"}
020:022 Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing
        what will happen to me there;
020:023 except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city,
        saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
020:024 But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself,
        so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I
        received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News
        of the grace of God.
020:025 "Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about
        preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
020:026 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from
        the blood of all men,
020:027 for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
020:028 Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock,
        in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd
        the assembly of the Lord and{TR, NU omit "the Lord and"} God
        which he purchased with his own blood.
020:029 For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter
        in among you, not sparing the flock.
020:030 Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things,
        to draw away the disciples after them.
020:031 Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years
        I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.
020:032 Now, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where the context
        allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."} I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace,
        which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance
        among all those who are sanctified.
020:033 I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
020:034 You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities,
        and those who were with me.
020:035 In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought
        to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
        that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
020:036 When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed
        with them all.
020:037 They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,
020:038 sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken,
        that they should see his face no more.  And they accompanied
        him to the ship.
021:001 When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail,
        we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes,
        and from there to Patara.
021:002 Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard,
        and set sail.
021:003 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand,
        we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship
        was to unload her cargo.
021:004 Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days.
        These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go
        up to Jerusalem.
021:005 When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed
        and went on our journey.  They all, with wives and children,
        brought us on our way until we were out of the city.
        Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.
021:006 After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship,
        and they returned home again.
021:007 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais.
        We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.
021:008 On the next day, we, who were Paul's companions, departed, and came
        to Caesarea.  We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist,
        who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
021:009 Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
021:010 As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus
        came down from Judea.
021:011 Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet
        and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit:  'So will
        the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt,
        and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
021:012 When we heard these things, both we and they of that place
        begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
021:013 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking
        my heart?  For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die
        at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
021:014 When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord's
        will be done."
021:015 After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
021:016 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us,
        bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom
        we would stay.
021:017 When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
021:018 The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all
        the elders were present.
021:019 When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things
        which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.
021:020 They, when they heard it, glorified God.  They said to him,
        "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among
        the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous
        for the law.
021:021 They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews
        who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not
        to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
021:022 What then?  The assembly must certainly meet, for they will
        hear that you have come.
021:023 Therefore do what we tell you.  We have four men who have
        taken a vow.
021:024 Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their
        expenses for them, that they may shave their heads.
        Then all will know that there is no truth in the things
        that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself
        also walk keeping the law.
021:025 But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our
        decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they
        should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood,
        from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."
021:026 Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself
        and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment
        of the days of purification, until the offering was offered
        for every one of them.
021:027 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia,
        when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude
        and laid hands on him,
021:028 crying out, "Men of Israel, help!  This is the man who teaches all
        men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place.
        Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has
        defiled this holy place!"
021:029 For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city,
        and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
021:030 All the city was moved, and the people ran together.
        They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple.
        Immediately the doors were shut.
021:031 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding
        officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
021:032 Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them.
        They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,
        stopped beating Paul.
021:033 Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him,
        commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired
        who he was and what he had done.
021:034 Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd.
        When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise,
        he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
021:035 When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried
        by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
021:036 for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out,
        "Away with him!"
021:037 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks,
        he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?"
        He said, "Do you know Greek?
021:038 Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up
        to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand
        men of the Assassins?"
021:039 But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen
        of no insignificant city.  I beg you, allow me to speak
        to the people."
021:040 When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs,
        beckoned with his hand to the people.  When there was a
        great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
022:001 "Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now
        make to you."
022:002 When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language,
        they were even more quiet.  He said,
022:003 "I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up
        in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according
        to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous
        for God, even as you all are this day.
022:004 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering
        into prisons both men and women.
022:005 As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify,
        from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled
        to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem
        in bonds to be punished.
022:006 It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close
        to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky
        a great light around me.
022:007 I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul,
        why are you persecuting me?'
022:008 I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?'  He said to me, 'I am Jesus
        of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'
022:009 "Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid,
        but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
022:010 I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?'  The Lord said to me, 'Arise,
        and go into Damascus.  There you will be told about all things
        which are appointed for you to do.'
022:011 When I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led
        by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
022:012 One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported
        of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,
022:013 came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul,
        receive your sight!'  In that very hour I looked up at him.
022:014 He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know
        his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice
        from his mouth.
022:015 For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you
        have seen and heard.
022:016 Now why do you wait?  Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins,
        calling on the name of the Lord.'
022:017 "It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I
        prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,
022:018 and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly,
        because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'
022:019 I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat
        in every synagogue those who believed in you.
022:020 When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also
        was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding
        the cloaks of those who killed him.'
022:021 "He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here
        to the Gentiles.'"
022:022 They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted
        up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow,
        for he isn't fit to live!"
022:023 As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust
        into the air,
022:024 the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks,
        ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know
        for what crime they shouted against him like that.
022:025 When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion
        who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is
        a Roman, and not found guilty?"
022:026 When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer
        and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man
        is a Roman!"
022:027 The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you
        a Roman?"  He said, "Yes."
022:028 The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship
        for a great price."  Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."
022:029 Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him,
        and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized
        that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.
022:030 But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was
        accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded
        the chief priests and all the council to come together,
        and brought Paul down and set him before them.
023:001 Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have
        lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
023:002 The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him
        to strike him on the mouth.
023:003 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!
        Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me
        to be struck contrary to the law?"
023:004 Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"
023:005 Paul said, "I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest.
        For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler
        of your people.'"{Exodus 22:28}
023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees
        and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council,
        "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.
        Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I
        am being judged!"
023:007 When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees
        and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel,
        nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.
023:009 A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part
        stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man.
        But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let's not
        fight against God!"
023:010 When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that
        Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers
        to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring
        him into the barracks.
023:011 The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said,
        "Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem,
        so you must testify also at Rome."
023:012 When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound
        themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat
        nor drink until they had killed Paul.
023:013 There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
023:014 They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said,
        "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing
        until we have killed Paul.
023:015 Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding
        officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow,
        as though you were going to judge his case more exactly.
        We are ready to kill him before he comes near."
023:016 But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait,
        and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.
023:017 Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this
        young man to the commanding officer, for he has something
        to tell him."
023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer,
        and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring
        this young man to you, who has something to tell you."
023:019 The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside,
        asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
023:020 He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul
        down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire
        somewhat more accurately concerning him.
023:021 Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie
        in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse
        neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him.
        Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
023:022 So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him,
        "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
023:023 He called to himself two of the centurions, and said,
        "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea,
        with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears,
        at the third hour of the night{about 9:00 PM}."
023:024 He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one,
        and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
023:025 He wrote a letter like this:
023:026 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix:  Greetings.
023:027 "This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed
        by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him,
        having learned that he was a Roman.
023:028 Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought
        him down to their council.
023:029 I found him to be accused about questions of their law,
        but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death
        or of bonds.
023:030 When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent
        him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring
        their accusations against him before you.  Farewell."
023:031 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought
        him by night to Antipatris.
023:032 But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him,
        and returned to the barracks.
023:033 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor,
        they also presented Paul to him.
023:034 When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from.
        When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,
023:035 "I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive."
        He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.
024:001 After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down
        with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus.
        They informed the governor against Paul.
024:002 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,
        "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent
        measures are coming to this nation,
024:003 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix,
        with all thankfulness.
024:004 But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us
        and hear a few words.
024:005 For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator
        of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world,
        and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
024:006 He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.{TR
        adds "We wanted to judge him according to our law,"}
024:007 {TR adds "but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with
        great violence took him out of our hands,"}
024:008 {TR adds "commanding his accusers to come to you."}By examining
        him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which
        we accuse him."
024:009 The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these
        things were so.
024:010 When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered,
        "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation
        for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
024:011 seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve
        days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.
024:012 In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring
        up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
024:013 Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
024:014 But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call
        a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all
        things which are according to the law, and which are written
        in the prophets;
024:015 having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for,
        that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of
        the just and unjust.
024:016 Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense
        toward God and men.
024:017 Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy
        to my nation, and offerings;
024:018 amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple,
        not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
024:019 They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation,
        if they had anything against me.
024:020 Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found
        in me when I stood before the council,
024:021 unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them,
        'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged
        before you today!'"
024:022 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way,
        deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer,
        comes down, I will decide your case."
024:023 He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody,
        and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his
        friends to serve him or to visit him.
024:024 But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife,
        who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning
        the faith in Christ Jesus.
024:025 As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the
        judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered,
        "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me,
        I will summon you."
024:026 Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul,
        that he might release him.  Therefore also he sent for him
        more often, and talked with him.
024:027 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by
        Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left
        Paul in bonds.
025:001 Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days
        went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
025:002 Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed
        him against Paul, and they begged him,
025:003 asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem;
        plotting to kill him on the way.
025:004 However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody
        at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.
025:005 "Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you
        go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man,
        let them accuse him."
025:006 When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down
        to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat,
        and commanded Paul to be brought.
025:007 When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem
        stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous
        charges which they could not prove,
025:008 while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law
        of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar,
        have I sinned at all."
025:009 But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul
        and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged
        by me there concerning these things?"
025:010 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat,
        where I ought to be tried.  I have done no wrong to the Jews,
        as you also know very well.
025:011 For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy
        of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things
        is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them.
        I appeal to Caesar!"
025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
        "You have appealed to Caesar.  To Caesar you shall go."
025:013 Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice
        arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.
025:014 As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before
        the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
025:015 about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders
        of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.
025:016 To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans
        to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met
        the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make
        his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
025:017 When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay,
        but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded
        the man to be brought.
025:018 Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought
        no charge of such things as I supposed;
025:019 but had certain questions against him about their own religion,
        and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed
        to be alive.
025:020 Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things,
        I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there
        be judged concerning these matters.
025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of
        the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send
        him to Caesar."
025:022 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself."
        "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."
025:023 So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with
        great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing
        with the commanding officers and principal men of the city,
        at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
025:024 Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present
        with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude
        of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here,
        crying that he ought not to live any longer.
025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
        and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined
        to send him.
025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord.
        Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially
        before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have
        something to write.
025:027 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner,
        not to also specify the charges against him."
026:001 Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself."
        Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.
026:002 "I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my
        defense before you this day concerning all the things that I
        am accused by the Jews,
026:003 especially because you are expert in all customs and
        questions which are among the Jews.  Therefore I beg you
        to hear me patiently.
026:004 "Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up,
        which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;
026:005 having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify,
        that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
026:006 Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made
        by God to our fathers,
026:007 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day,
        hope to attain.  Concerning this hope I am accused by
        the Jews, King Agrippa!
026:008 Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?
026:009 "I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things
        contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
026:010 This I also did in Jerusalem.  I both shut up many of the saints
        in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests,
        and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
026:011 Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make
        them blaspheme.  Being exceedingly enraged against them,
        I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
026:012 "Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority
        and commission from the chief priests,
026:013 at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky,
        brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who
        traveled with me.
026:014 When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me
        in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?
        It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
026:015 "I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'  "He said, 'I am Jesus,
        whom you are persecuting.
026:016 But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you
        for this purpose:  to appoint you a servant and a witness
        both of the things which you have seen, and of the things
        which I will reveal to you;
026:017 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles,
        to whom I send you,
026:018 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light
        and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive
        remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are
        sanctified by faith in me.'
026:019 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to
        the heavenly vision,
026:020 but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem,
        and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles,
        that they should repent and turn to God, doing works
        worthy of repentance.
026:021 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried
        to kill me.
026:022 Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand
        to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing
        but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
026:023 how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead,
        he would be first to proclaim light both to these people
        and to the Gentiles."
026:024 As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul,
        you are crazy!  Your great learning is driving you insane!"
026:025 But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly
        declare words of truth and reasonableness.
026:026 For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely.
        For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him,
        for this has not been done in a corner.
026:027 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets?  I know that you believe."
026:028 Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying
        to make me a Christian?"
026:029 Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much,
        not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become
        such as I am, except for these bonds."
026:030 The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those
        who sat with them.
026:031 When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying,
        "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
026:032 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free
        if he had not appealed to Caesar."
027:001 When it was determined that we should sail for Italy,
        they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion
        named Julius, of the Augustan band.
027:002 Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places
        on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian
        of Thessalonica, being with us.
027:003 The next day, we touched at Sidon.  Julius treated Paul kindly,
        and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.
027:004 Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,
        because the winds were contrary.
027:005 When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia
        and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
027:006 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy,
        and he put us on board.
027:007 When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with
        difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further,
        we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
027:008 With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place
        called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
027:009 When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous,
        because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,
027:010 and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be
        with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship,
        but also of our lives."
027:011 But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner
        of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
027:012 Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority
        advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could
        reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete,
        looking northeast and southeast.
027:013 When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained
        their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete,
        close to shore.
027:014 But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is
        called Euroclydon.{Or, "a northeaster."}
027:015 When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave
        way to it, and were driven along.
027:016 Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda,
        we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.
027:017 After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help
        reinforce the ship.  Fearing that they would run aground
        on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor,
        and so were driven along.
027:018 As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they
        began to throw things overboard.
027:019 On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with
        their own hands.
027:020 When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days,
        and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would
        be saved was now taken away.
027:021 When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle
        of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me,
        and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this
        injury and loss.
027:022 Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life
        among you, but only of the ship.
027:023 For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God
        whose I am and whom I serve,
027:024 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul.  You must stand before Caesar.
        Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
027:025 Therefore, sirs, cheer up!  For I believe God, that it will
        be just as it has been spoken to me.
027:026 But we must run aground on a certain island."
027:027 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back
        and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors
        surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
027:028 They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms.{20 fathoms
        = 120 feet = 36.6 meters} After a little while, they took
        soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.{15 fathoms = 90
        feet = 27.4 meters}
027:029 Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let
        go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.
027:030 As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had
        lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would
        lay out anchors from the bow,
027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these
        stay in the ship, you can't be saved."
027:032 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let
        it fall off.
027:033 While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take
        some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you
        wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
027:034 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety;
        for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
027:035 When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God
        in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.
027:036 Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
027:037 In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.
027:038 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship,
        throwing out the wheat into the sea.
027:039 When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they
        noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try
        to drive the ship onto it.
027:040 Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same
        time untying the rudder ropes.  Hoisting up the foresail
        to the wind, they made for the beach.
027:041 But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran
        the vessel aground.  The bow struck and remained immovable,
        but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
027:042 The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none
        of them would swim out and escape.
027:043 But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from
        their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should
        throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
027:044 and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other
        things from the ship.  So it happened that they all escaped
        safely to the land.
028:001 When we had escaped, then they{NU reads "we"} learned that
        the island was called Malta.
028:002 The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled
        a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain,
        and because of the cold.
028:003 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid
        them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat,
        and fastened on his hand.
028:004 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand,
        they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer,
        whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has
        not allowed to live."
028:005 However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.
028:006 But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen
        down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time
        and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds,
        and said that he was a god.
028:007 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging
        to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us,
        and courteously entertained us for three days.
028:008 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever
        and dysentery.  Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying
        his hands on him, healed him.
028:009 Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases
        in the island came, and were cured.
028:010 They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed,
        they put on board the things that we needed.
028:011 After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had
        wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."
028:012 Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.
028:013 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium.
        After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day
        we came to Puteoli,
028:014 where we found brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where
        context allows may also be correctly translated "brothers
        and sisters" or "siblings."} and were entreated to stay
        with them for seven days.  So we came to Rome.
028:015 From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet
        us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns.
        When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.
028:016 When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
        to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay
        by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
028:017 It happened that after three days Paul called together those who
        were the leaders of the Jews.  When they had come together,
        he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing
        against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was
        delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
028:018 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free,
        because there was no cause of death in me.
028:019 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained
        to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to
        accuse my nation.
028:020 For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you.
        For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
028:021 They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea
        concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report
        or speak any evil of you.
028:022 But we desire to hear from you what you think.  For, as concerning
        this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
028:023 When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him
        at his lodging.  He explained to them, testifying about
        the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus,
        both from the law of Moses and from the prophets,
        from morning until evening.
028:024 Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
028:025 When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after
        Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly
        through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,
028:026 saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear,
        but will in no way understand.  In seeing, you will see,
        but will in no way perceive.
028:027 For this people's heart has grown callous.  Their ears
        are dull of hearing.  Their eyes they have closed.
        Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears,
        understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I
        would heal them.'{Isaiah 6:9-10}
028:028 "Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God
        is sent to the nations.  They will also listen."
028:029 When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great
        dispute among themselves.
028:030 Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house,
        and received all who were coming to him,
028:031 preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning
        the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
