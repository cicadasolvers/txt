EXERCISES IN KNITTING.



Receipts for Twelve Chair Covers, in different Patterns.


As the number of stitches required to work each pattern will
be mentioned, these patterns can easily be applied for any other
purpose, and are most of them well adapted for doilies. Some
of the most open patterns are suitable for Shetland shawls; and
as the majority of the chair covers are now done in coloured
wool, the colours and number of shades will be described; though,
if wished in white, the linen thread, No. 1, is the proper material
to be used.




I.

German Pattern of Open Double Knitting, both Sides alike.


Large wooden pins are required for this pattern, which is done
in double or eight-threaded wool, in 5 colours that contrast
well--claret, gold colour, blue, white, scarlet; and 4 rows of
each, worked in the order they are here placed. Cast on 71
stitches.

First row:--Seam 1, make 1, slip 1: this row is only to begin
with, and is not repeated, the whole of the knitting being done
as the

Second row:--Seam 2 together, make 1, by passing the wool
round the pin, slip 1, and repeat. At the end of the row, if
correctly knitted, there will be 1 stitch, which seam. When the
colours have been repeated 6 times, the cover will be the proper size.

To finish it round, work fringe No. 2, work claret for the head,
and put in two lengths of each colour in the fringe.




II.

Nun's Pattern.


Pins No. 10, 8 stitches to a pattern: 14 shades of orange
4-threaded German wool, beginning with the darkest, and working
6 rows of each: 4 plain rows to begin and end the cover; and 4
plain stitches at the beginning and end of every row, for an edge.
These edge stitches are not mentioned with the pattern, but will
be included in the number cast on. Cast on 112 stitches.

First row:--Make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2, slip 1, knit 2
together, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 2, and repeat.

Second row:--Seamed.

Third row:--Make 1, knit 3, make 1, knit 1, slip 1, knit 2
together, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 1, and repeat.

continuing with the 2d lightest shade.

row is knit between every increased one.

times in every other row, till you have 16 stitches between every

whole making 30 rows.

When the hood is made up, satin ribbon is first run between
the holes, and then turned back, and stuffed with wool. It is
turned over to the second of the 8 plain rows. Satin ribbon is
run between the 3 rows of holes and the increased parts down the
crown, which is sewed up. The curtain, or frill, is sewed to the
back part, and is knit as follows:--Cast on 64 stitches, knit 18
plain rows, then take up the stitches at each side, and knit a plain
row; bring the wool forward, and knit 2 together for the row, 1
plain row, cast off, then draw the ribbon through the holes, and
sew on the frill. The crown is neatly lined with white Persian,
and strings of sarcenet added. A rosette of ribbon is an improvement.
Pink, white, or blue wool, is the best colour to knit this
hood in.

Baby's Shoe and Stocking.


Set on 80 stitches, and knit the top as the Swiss mittens.
When deep enough, diminish your stitches to 60. Knit 2 seamed
rows in colour, then 2 plain white, and 6 rows of bars, formed by
knitting 2 plain and 2 seamed stitches alternately for 3 rows, and
then 2 plain rounds, then reverse the ribbing, and so on, with 2
plain rounds between. Divide the back and front--on the 2 back
pins 32 stitches, 28 on the front; on the back pins knit 2 more
plain rows, on the front continue the bars 6 more rows, and at
the end knit 4 plain rows. This finishes the stocking part.

For the shoe, set on 32 stitches of coloured wool on a separate
pin: 1 plain row, and 1 row of holes for ribbon to go through,
1 plain row, and then join it to the back part of the stocking,
knit 2 seamed rows, 2 plain, 3 rows of bars, and 2 seamed rows.
Divide for the heel 12 stitches on the middle pin, and 10 on each
side, which you bind down. Continue 3 plain rows on the middle
part where there are 12 stitches, and 3 rows of bars; no plain rows
at the end; take up each side of the heel 10 stitches, and seam 3
rows. For the foot part, knit 2 plain rows, and 8 rows of bars,
before knitting the plain rows to these 8 rows of bars. Set on 28
stitches of coloured wool on a separate pin, and after knitting 2
seamed rows, join it to the front part of the stocking, then knit
2 plain rounds all round to join the whole, but in the back
part reduce 4 stitches to make it equal with the 28 in front.
Commence the pattern or bars on the back pin, and make the 1st
stitch a plain one, at the end of that pin, and on the front one
seam 3 stitches to form the side of the shoe, with 2 plain rows
as before, narrowing at the end and beginning of the pins. At the
beginning of the pins, narrow the 1st stitch, and at the end before
the 3 seamed stitches, and only narrow in the plain rows. When
you have narrowed to have 10 on the front and back pins, 20 in
all, knit 4 plain rows, and finish by turning it and binding down.
The front part of the shoe should have 4 rows of bars; join the
sides of the shoe and stocking, and knit 4 seamed rows; draw a
ribbon through the back part where you made the holes.




Shell Pattern for a Baby's Cap.


Pins No. 22, and the finest linen thread.

The front part is knit with 2 needles only. Cast on 208 stitches,
knit 5 rows plain for the beginning. After these 5, you must
diminish 1 stitch in every shell, so as to have only 192. Then 3
rows of the pattern, or shells, 2 rows of holes (for putting narrow
ribbon in) before doing the pattern again, which is done in this
manner: bring your thread forward, knit 2 stitches together, and
so on to the end of your needle. Knit 5 rows of plain between
these 2 rows of holes; when this is concluded, knit 4 rows of the
shells, and then 2 rows of the holes the same as before, with the
5 plain rows between, then again 2 rows of the pattern or shells.
You now take your two other needles, and increase 43 stitches for
the back of the head; 2 rows plain, 1 row for putting ribbon in,
and 3 rows plain, then knit 8 rows of the shells; the 7th row you
must have 7 holes in each shell, and the 8th but 6. After this,
seam the first and second stitches, knit the third plain, without
taking it off, and twist it so as to make 2 stitches of this last
one; then seam the fifth, slip the sixth without knitting, knit the
seventh plain, and pass the sixth over, knit the eighth plain, slip
the ninth, and the tenth knit plain, and pass the ninth over it.
The next row: seam the first stitch, slip the second, knit the
third, and pass the second over without taking it off, and knit it
twisted; twist the fourth, seam the fifth, and knit the 3 remaining
plain. After this row, knit 2 rows plain all round; after these,
make a row of holes (for putting ribbon in) by taking 2 stitches
together, and making one as before. First 3 rows plain all round,
another row of holes, and then 3 rows plain. Then do the pattern
8 shells round the cap, and so continue until you have but 5
stitches instead of 9 (not including the 2 twisted, and the seamed).

After this row, seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th,
raise a stitch by picking up a loop, slip the 5th, knit the 6th, and
pass the 5th over, knit the 7th plain, and take the 8th and 9th
together, raise one stitch before beginning to seam.

The next row:--Seam the 1st, slip the 2d, knit the 3d plain,
and pass the 2d half through, and knit it plain, seam the 4th,
knit the 5th plain, slip the 6th without knitting, knit the 7th,
and pass over the 6th to the left, and the 8th to the right, knit
the 9th plain.

Then do 2 rows of plain knitting all round, 2 rows of the holes
(for ribbon), knitting 2 rows plain to divide them, and 4
plain rows to finish with. Take off your stitches on a needle
with coarse thread, and tie it up.

The pattern stitch:--First row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the
2d and 3d, seam the 4th, knit the 5th plain, bring your thread
forward, and so continue for 9 stitches plain, counting the 5th for
1; by putting your thread forward, you will have 17 stitches.

Second row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the 2d and 3d, seam
the 4th, and knit the 17 plain when with 4 needles, and seam
them when with 2.

Third row:--Seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th,
slip the 5th, knit the 6th plain, and pass over the 5th; knit 15
stitches plain, including the 6th, and take 2 together at the
15th.

Fourth row:--The same as the 3d, with the exception of the
number, which is 13 this time, diminishing at the first and
thirteenth as before.

Fifth row:--The same as the fourth row, only 11 stitches instead
of 13.

Sixth row:--The same as the fifth, only 9 stitches instead of 11.

After the 6 rows, you begin at the first again, the 6 rows
comprising all the pattern.




For a Knitted Bodice.


Five ounces of four-thread fleecy, and No. 10 pins.

Cast on 60 stitches, and knit 3 plain rows.

Fourth row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch,
knit 2 together, and so on to the end of the row; knit 4 plain
rows, knit 70 rows in double knitting, knit the 4 first and last
stitches of every row plain, then let off all the stitches on to
a piece of thread, except 25 on the right-hand side. *Knit these
25 stitches backwards and forwards (remembering that the 4 plain
stitches are still to be knit on the right-hand side, but not on
the other) for 26 rows; then cast on 15 additional stitches; the 4
plain stitches are now to be knit on both sides for 74 rows. Knit
3 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch, knit
2 together, and so on, knit 3 plain rows, and cast off. This
completes the back and one front. You then let off 25 stitches
on the other side, and repeat from the point marked above with
an asterisk. Then take up the stitches all round the neck, and
knit 3 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch and knit 2 together alternately, knit
4 plain rows, and cast off. Then sew the two fronts to the back,
about one third of the length up, and run a ribbon through the
row of holes formed at the top and bottom. This is worn outside
the dress; and under a shawl or cloak is very comfortable. All
should be done in double knitting but the 4 edge stitches.

15 times. Then take very small needles, and knit a binder, in
simple ribs, in any of the shades, 15 rows deep.

The handle is made by knitting on 2 needles of the same size
as those used for the bag, with double wool, in the following
manner:--Cast on 14 stitches, slip 1, bring the wool forward,
slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped one over the knitted one to the
last 2, which are both knitted; without bringing the wool forward,
fold the two edges into the middle, and sew together with the
double wool. Silk tassels to match.




Pretty Pattern for Basket Serviettes.


Six stitches to a pattern. Cast on 76 stitches, knit 2 plain
at each edge.

First row:--Make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2 together, knit 1,
knit 2 together.

Second row:--Seamed.

Third row:--Make 1, knit 3, make 1, knit 3 together.

Fourth row:--Seamed.

Fifth row:--Knit 2 together, knit 1, knit 2 together, make 1,
knit 1, make 1.

Sixth row:--Seamed.

Seventh row:--Knit 3 together, make 1, knit 3, make 1.

Eighth row:--Seamed. Repeat from first row. The plain
rows between may be knit, instead of seamed, if wished.




Oriental Mat, or Hookah Carpet.


This may also be used as a carriage rug, or is very pretty as a
mat for the front of the piano.

It is composed of an open stripe of dark knitting, and a stripe
of white knitting, with a pattern worked in cross stitch on it,
and is quite new. Large wooden pins are required, and 12-threaded
fleecy, dark claret for the open stripe, and white, with 4 shades of
gold, green, lilac, and scarlet, form a good combination of colours
for the close stripe, and are extremely rich in their effect. For
the open stripe cast on 18 stitches.

First row:--Knit 2 stitches, bring the wool forward, pass the
first of the 2 knit stitches over, knit 2, bring the wool forward,
pass the first of the 2 knit stitches over, repeat.

Second row:--Seamed: repeat these 2 rows alternately till you
have done the length you wish your mat to be.

For the close stripe cast on 20 stitches, and knit the same length
as the open stripe. When finished, pin it on to a weighted cushion
to work the pattern on it, as that stretches the knitting, and shews
more plainly where you should put your needle in.

Then work the annexed pattern on it. First pattern in shades
of gold; second, shades of green; third, shades of scarlet; fourth,
shades of lilac. Repeat with the gold. Four stripes of the white,
and 3 of the dark, will make a nice-sized mat for a drawing-room.
If for a carriage rug, an additional stripe of each.

Very elegant Knitted Pelisse.


This may be made either smaller or larger by using finer or
coarser wool and pins.

It is usually done in 4-thread fleecy, with coloured centre, and
border to imitate ermine.

Cast on 270 stitches with white, bring the wool forward, slip a
stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, and repeat: every row is
alike. Knit 24 rows with the white, then slip off 24 stitches at
the beginning of the next row, and join the coloured wool, leave
24 stitches at the other end. These stitches are not required again
till the centre is done, and are then knitted in white to form the
border up the sides: this will leave 222, knit with these, with the
coloured wool for 12 rows.

Next row:--Knit 27, bring the wool forward, slip 1, and instead
of knitting only 2 together, knit 5 together: this decreases 1 rib.
Knit to within 30 stitches of the end, decrease 1 rib as before, knit
13 rows, and decrease 1 rib at the beginning and end of the next
row as before: each decreasing is done at the beginning of the row
after knitting 27 stitches, and when within 30 of the end; knit
11 rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end of the next row; knit 13
rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end; knit 13 rows.

Next row:--Knit 27 stitches, decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches,
decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches, decrease again; knit and repeat,
decreasing after every 6 stitches, till 14 ribs are decreased; knit
the 30 last stitches without decreasing; knit 24 rows without
decreasing.

Next row:--Knit 27 stitches on to another needle, and knit
them backwards and forwards for 42 rows: then cast off 3 stitches
at the end nearest the centre, knit 2 rows, cast off 3 more stitches,
knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 more stitches, till only 9 stitches are
left, then cast off the 9 stitches; this completes 1 front, except
the white, which will be mentioned below. The 27 last stitches are
knitted in the same manner for the other front; then the stitches
that remain for the back are knitted for 42 rows; then cast off 3
stitches at each end, knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 at each end, till
you have cast off 18 at each end, knit 2 plain rows, and cast off
the remainder of the stitches; then sew the shoulders very loosely,
or it will contract them. The 24 stitches of white that were let
off to another pin must be knit on each side the length of the
front, and neatly sewed to it.

For the sleeves:--Cast on 66 stitches, and knit 78 rows: this
is for the coloured part, and in sewing it together at the elbow, it
must be rather tightened; and for the cuff, which is done in white,
cast on 18 stitches and knit 66 rows, and sew it very nicely to the
coloured part.

For the collar:--Cast on 120 stitches with white, knit 8 rows.

Next row:--Knit to within 12 stitches of the end, turn back,
and knit to within 12 of the other end.

Next row:--Leave 6 more stitches at each end.

Next row:--Leave 24 stitches at each end, then 33, 39, 45, and
48 stitches, turning back between each as before, knit to the end
of the row with white, join the coloured wool, knit 8 rows.

Next row:--Leave 12 stitches at the end, turn back, and leave
the same number at the other end.

Next row:--Leave 18, then 24, 30, 36, and 42, at each end,
then 2 rows of coloured, knitting the whole number of stitches,
then cast off, and sew it to the neck.

A cord of tassels for the neck and waist, made of the white
and coloured wool, to be added, and little tufts of black wool
sewed into the white border at equal distances, completes this
elegant pelisse.

together, make a stitch, knit 4 plain stitches, make a stitch, knit
3 stitches together, make a stitch, knit 4 plain stitches, and so on

Second row:--Seamed.

Third row:--Knit the same as the first, and continue with
these 2 rows alternately for 10 rows, then slip off 28 stitches
on to another needle, then knit the remaining stitches backwards
and forwards for 16 rows, increasing 1 stitch at the beginning of
each of the last 8 rows, join the coloured wool and knit 2 plain
rows, then 2 rows of white.

Next row:--Make a stitch, seam 2 together, make a stitch,
seam 2 together, and so on; knit 1 plain row of white, then take

Then run a ribbon, of the same colour as the wool, through the
holes of the border round the back and front of the cap.

Cast on 80 stitches with the lightest shade, and knit 3 plain
rows: in the fourth row pass the wool round the pin, seam 2
stitches together, pass the wool round the pin, seam 2 together,
and so on to the end of the row; join the next lightest shade, and
knit 3 plain rows. In the fourth row, seam 2 stitches together,
pass the wool round the pin, seam 2 together, and so on to the end
of the row. Continue in this manner, knitting 3 plain rows, and
an open row of each shade, till the darkest; then again to the
lightest: this forms 1 stripe, 4 of which are required. The last
stripe should finish with the lightest shade, to correspond with
the beginning. The shading of each stripe must be reversed; thus,
first begin with the lightest shade and knit to the darkest, then
knit from the darkest to the lightest, and then again to the darkest,
and so on. This should be done in double German wool, in five
shades of sable or chinchilla colours, and satin put underneath the
knitting of the same colour.

stitches plain, pass the thread in front of each of the 2 next
stitches and knit them, which increases and makes the holes;
then knit 3 more plain, and decrease again as above; then seam a
stitch; and so on all round: after each round done in this way,
knit a plain round.

Beautiful Pattern for a Scarf.


Five ounces of Shetland wool, or 4 of silk, are required. This
may either be worked with a deep shaded border or all plain;
worked in the fine black Shetland wool or Ardoise silk, it has the

which are not mentioned in the pattern; they are knit and seamed
every alternate row. No. 11 pins for Shetland wool, and No. 12

A Pretty Pattern for a Baby's Shoe.


Cast on 30 stitches, knit 8 rows, increasing 1 at the beginning
of each, knit 12 rows, increasing 1 at the beginning of every other
row for the toe, knit 4 rows without increasing. You will now

rows, cast on 32 stitches, knit 4 rows, knit 12 rows, decreasing
1 at the beginning of every other at the same end that you before

let in to shape it better, for which take up 12 stitches along the
increased part of the toe, and knit 10 rows, decreasing 1 at the
beginning of every other one at the end nearest the casting on.

For the instep:--Take up the 32 stitches on each side, and 16
across the toe, knit 2 plain rows all round, and cast off; then

each side on to separate needles. With the 16 stitches across the
toe, knit 2 plain rows, taking up one of the 32 stitches at the end
of each row, and knitting it together with the last stitch.

with the last of each row; then take the stitches on each side on
to the same needle with the centre ones, and knit 5 plain rows.

Fan-Pattern Knitting for a Mitten.


Needles No. 19, and fine black netting silk. Set 30 stitches on
each of 3 needles; and, after knitting a top either in ribs or any
other pattern, begin the fan, by seaming the first stitch; the
second stitch plain, except that you take the outside part of the
stitch; seam the third; knit the fourth quite plain; bring the
thread in front of the next 6 stitches, and knit them, which makes
13 stitches. With the fourth you knit plain, then seam again, as
at first, and so on for 1 round.

Second round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as at the beginning,
and wherever you did in the first round; knit the other 13 stitches
quite plain.

Third round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as in the first round,
slip the fourth stitch, knit the next, and bring the slipped stitch
over them; knit the others plain, till you come to the 2 last before
the seamed stitch; then with your left-hand needle take off the
last knit stitch, and bring the one from behind over that, which
decreases 2 with the one you did after seaming, and so on for 1
round, and every other, till you have reduced the 13 stitches to 7;
then begin again the first round.

It is well to count the stitches frequently, that you may have
them even, allowing 3 for the ribs and 7 plain, whenever you begin
the fan, so that there will be 3 fans on each needle. When you
have 4 or 5 rounds of fans, begin the thumb by bringing the silk
forward, and knitting a stitch, which increases 1; then knit a plain
stitch, and increase the same as before. This do every other row,
till you have as many as you think enough--say 30 stitches; leave
the 30 stitches, and go on with the hand part, and finish that off
at the top; after, knit the thumb. Observe, in increasing, to bring
your silk directly over the stitch you increased to the right hand;
and to the left, knit over, and bring the silk in front of the stitch
after the increased.




Corkscrew Muffatees.

3 seamed and 3 knit between them. Three rounds of 3 stitches
plain and 3 seamed. Then 3 rounds, the first 2 and last stitches
seamed, and the middle 3 plain, and 3 seamed. Then seam the
first and last 2 stitches of the next 3 rounds, and begin the whole
pattern again, only knitting 3 rounds instead of 2, as at first,
of 3 seamed and 3 plain.

Receipt for a Stocking.


No. 10 Mee's Persian thread, and needles No. 22, are the proper
sizes. Cast on 56 stitches on the first needle, and 48 on each
of the other 2. Knit 1 row plain. Second row: knit 40 stitches
plain, seam a stitch, knit all round plain. Knit 12 rows in the
same way, all plain but the seam-stitch. Now the pattern begins:
seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 15 plain. This
will bring you to the centre seam-stitch. Seam this stitch, and
knit 15 plain. This brings you to the end of the first needle.
Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 23 plain. This
will end the second needle. Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a
stitch, knit 23 plain. This ends the third needle. Seam a stitch,
knit 6 plain stitches, bring the cotton forward, knit 1, bring the
cotton forward and knit 1. Continue to bring the cotton forward
and knit 1 till you have made 12 additional stitches. Knit 5 plain,
seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15. (This is the back
of the stocking, and must always be knit the same--15 plain, 1
seamed, and 15 plain.) Seam a stitch, knit 6 plain, bring the
cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue this till you have made 12
additional stitches, as before. Knit 5, seam a stitch, knit 6,
bring the cotton forward, and make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5,
seam a stitch, knit 6, make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5, seam a
stitch, knit 6, make 12 as before, and knit 5. This finishes the
row; and you have 60 additional stitches for the pattern. Seam
a stitch and knit 35 plain, seam a stitch and knit the back of
the stocking, seam a stitch and knit 35, seam and knit 35, seam
and knit 35, seam and knit 35. This ends the row. Knit 2 rows
more same as the last. You have now made stitches enough for
the pattern, and begin it. First row: seam a stitch, knit 2
together 6 times, bring the cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue
this till you have 11 holes made. Bring the cotton forward and
slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the
knitted one, slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch
over the knitted one. Continue to slip a stitch, knit a stitch,
and pull the slipped one over it 4 times more, which should bring
you to the seam-stitch. Knit the back of the stocking, and continue
this pattern round the other two needles, which will conclude the row.
The next 3 rows are knit plain, except the seam-stitches, which must
be attended to. This finishes the pattern; and you begin again at
the first row, and repeat the pattern 45 times. You then begin
the heel: knit the seam-stitch on the 1st needle plain, then knit
the pattern-row of the stripe; knit the back of the stocking and
knit the 1st stripe off of the next needle, (using the needle
you have knit the stripe and the back of the stocking with,)
remembering that this is the pattern-row; knit the seam-stitch at
the end of the stripe plain. You have now 2 stripes and the plain
back of the stocking on the heel needles, and 3 stripes on the
front of the stocking; with the front you have at present nothing
to do. The first or pattern row of the heel is knit; the remainder
of the heel is to be knit with double thread. Second row: slip a
stitch, seam 35 stitches, knit a plain stitch, seam 15, knit 1 plain,
seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Third row: slip a stitch, knit
35, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch,
knit 36. Fourth row: slip 1, seam 35, knit 1 plain, seam 15,
knit 1 plain, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Begin again with
the pattern-row, remembering that there is 1 plain stitch at the
beginning and end of each needle, which stitch must be slipped at
the beginning of every row. Repeat this pattern 9 times: at the
10th time slip a stitch, knit 7 double stitches, make 8 holes,
narrowing from the last hole, 7 times, in the same manner as
usual; this will reduce the pattern 6 stitches. For the 11th
time: slip 1, knit 7 double stitches, make 2 holes, narrowing
from the 2d hole in the usual manner; this will have reduced
the heel 14 stitches in each stripe, and finishes the pattern.
Knit 10 plain rows, knitting all the seam-stitches except the
middle one plain. The heel must now be closed; the narrowing must
begin in the row of plain knitting, not the seamed one. Knit 26
stitches, knit 2 together, knit 11 stitches, which brings you to
the seam; knit 11 stitches beyond the seam, slip a stitch, knit a
stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, turn back, slip
1 stitch, and seam 11 stitches, knit the seam-stitch plain, seam 11
stitches, seam 2 together, turn back, slip a stitch, knit to the
seam-stitch and 11 stitches beyond, slip a stitch, knit a stitch,
and pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one. Continue this
narrowing till you have knit up all the stitches at each side. Take
up the loops all along the side of the heel (they should be 29),
knit them with the single thread, knitting the 2 last on the needle
together. This begins the gore. Knit the 3 stripes on the front
needle, in the pattern, as usual, only remembering that you have
no seam-stitch between the gore and the pattern; take up the
loops all along the 2d side of the heel, and take half the heel
stitches on the same needle, then slip the 1st stitch, knit the 2d,
pull the slipped stitch over it, knit the remaining stitches on
the needle. There should now be 41 stitches on each of the side
needles. The middle of the heel ends the row, therefore the 1st
needle is the one which begins from that place. Knit 15 stitches
plain, make a stitch by taking up a loop of the last row, knit 3
stitches, make another as before, continue to knit 3 and make 1
till you have increased 11 stitches, which will bring you within
4 stitches of the end of the needle; knit them plain. Knit the
front needle in the 2d row of pattern, knitting 35 and seaming 1,
knitting 35, seaming 1, knitting 35, which ends the needle. Knit
3 stitches, make 1, knit 3 as before, till you have made 11, knit 15
plain, which ends the row. There should now be 51 stitches on
each of the side needles. You must knit to within 2 stitches of
the end of the 1st needle; knit them together. Knit the front
needle in 3d row of pattern. Third needle: slip a stitch, knit a
stitch, pull the slipped stitch over it, knit to the end of the
needle plain. The next row is not to be narrowed at either place.
Continue to narrow the side needles, as directed, every second
row, carrying on the pattern on the front needle, till you have
reduced the stitches on each side needle, the first to 35, and the
second to 36 stitches. There will now be 173 stitches all round.
Continue to knit the side needles plain, and the front in pattern,
till you have repeated the pattern from the beginning of the gore
32 times, join on the second thread, and narrow the pattern 14
stitches in each stripe in the manner directed for the heel. There
will now be 136 stitches on the needles. Knit 8 plain rows. Divide
the stitches exactly, leaving 68 on the front needle, and 34 on
each of the side needles. The first needle of the row is the same
as before. Knit to within 3 stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1,
pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Second
needle: knit 1 plain stitch, knit 2 together, knit to within 3
stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped stitch over
the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Third needle: knit 1 plain, knit 2
together, knit 1 to the end, knit 1 plain row all round. Continue
these alternate rows till you have reduced the stitches to 88, then
narrow every row, as directed, till there remain only 30 stitches
on the front needle, and 15 on each of the others. Cast off, and
fasten the thread.




For a Brioche.


Either 8-thread German or 3-thread fleecy should be used. Pins
No. 12. Cast on 90 stitches; keep the wool in front, slip a stitch
the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front, slip a
stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front,
slip a stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, and so on. The
whole of the knitting is done in this manner; then knit 2 rows of
dark for the edge, 2 rows of the colour for the centre, 2 more
dark: these 6 rows form an edge, which is done on each side of
each piece. Then commence the centre part of the stripe, and knit
2 rows to the end; in the third row, leave 6 stitches at the end, and
turn back, as if beginning a fresh row, and knit to the end; in the
next row, leave 12 stitches; then 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 stitches;
after leaving 42 stitches, you must only leave 3 more each time
instead of 6; and next leave 45, 48, 51, and so on, until you have
only 15 stitches left; then knit 2 rows of dark (the whole number
of stitches), 2 of the centre colour, 2 of dark; and take it off
like common knitting. This completes 1 piece, 16 of which are
required, and look pretty placed--scarlet, white, blue, gold,
scarlet, white, lilac, green: this forms half the brioche, and
the colours are repeated.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
