THE JUBILEE YEAR FUND.


In the last number of THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY we published the plea of
the Executive Committee of this Association for an offering to relieve
the Association in its financial necessities. We present below the
working point of that document in these words:

     It is proposed to raise during the next six months a special
     Jubilee Year Fund of $100,000, in shares of $50 each, with the
     hope and expectation that these shares will be taken by the
     friends of missions without lessening those regular
     contributions which must be depended upon to sustain the
     current work.

As the means of securing these gifts we subjoin the blank form of a
pledge, which, when signed by individuals or officers of churches, may
be sent to H. W. Hubbard, Treasurer, Bible House, New York. When the
amount pledged is paid our treasurer will send as a receipt a neatly
printed certificate. On another page will be found a list of pledges
already made.

We solicit especial attention to the closing paragraph of the sentence
quoted above, asking that these special gifts _shall not lessen the
regular contributions_, upon which the Association must depend to
sustain the current work.

We send forth this appeal under a deep sense of responsibility. We
know that business is still depressed and that many of the friends to
whom we make this plea have responded generously to the calls of
sister missionary societies. But we feel that it is a duty we owe to
God and to the needy peoples for whom we labor to attempt the relief
of this Association in its embarrassing and hindering liabilities. We
confidently believe that many of the churches and generous
individuals to whom we make this plea, feel as we do, a sense of duty
and responsibility in this important matter. Some to whom this may
come may be able to respond at once with a pledge of _one_ or _more_
shares. But to those who cannot, we urge that they lay by in store as
God may prosper them the means for as prompt a response as possible to
our call.

ARREST OF OUR TEACHERS IN ORANGE PARK, FLORIDA.


Rev. T. S. Perry, of Limerick, Me.; Mr. O. S. Dickinson, of West
Granville, Mass.; Principal B. D. Rowlee, of East Woodstock, Conn.;
Mrs. B. D. Rowlee; Miss Edith M. Robinson, of Battle Creek, Mich.;
Miss H. S. Loveland, of Newark Valley, N. Y.; and Miss Margaret Ball,
of Orange Park, Fla., with two patrons of the school (white) residing
in Orange Park, were all arrested by the Sheriff at Orange Park, Fla.,
on Friday the 10th of April, charged with the crime of teaching young
people of two races under the same roof. They were not taken to jail,
but were given until Monday--the intervening days of Saturday and
Sunday--to procure bail. This esteemed pastor of the Congregational
Church in Orange Park, the most worthy teachers and the patrons are
awaiting trial for this crime! and are only saved from jail by the
bail which has been procured for them. This is as far as the State of
Florida has descended in its shame at present.

This enactment, which we have been careful not to call a law, was
pronounced by the National Council to be "not only repugnant to
Christian principles, but also opposed to the civil rights guaranteed
by our Constitution," and the Association was called to persistently
resist it with all legal measures.

Senator Hoar of Massachusetts writes of it: "I am amazed that even in
Florida such things can be done. I think that this cannot stand a
moment before the Courts of the United States."

Arrests of Christian teachers because they instruct a few white
children under the same roof with colored children will not only call
the attention of the Nation to the gross darkness which dwells in the
minds of those who could make such an enactment, but it will bring
about a public opinion which will hasten the progress of the State
from its present low condition faster than almost any other agency.

Meanwhile Florida remains in shame.

The Hamilton Club has added the name of a colored man to the list of
its members. It is the first of the leading men's social organizations
in Chicago to abolish the color line. This special honor was conferred
upon Adelbert H. Roberts. The name passed the test of posting and the
directors were unanimous in his favor.--_Chicago Times-Herald._

HORSE NEEDED.--A faithful minister in our mountain field has great
need of a horse. He reaches half a dozen preaching-stations among
these Highlanders, often going on foot. Fifty dollars would purchase
him a good horse, and if any friend will respond to this appeal it
will increase the efficiency of an earnest missionary very greatly. If
a larger amount than this is received it will be expended in the work
among these mountain people.

JUBILEE FIELD DAYS IN THE INTERIOR.

SECRETARY CHARLES J. RYDER.


A reduction in the secretarial force of the American Missionary
Association, in order to cut down current expenses and decrease the
debt, has resulted in a serious loss in the effectiveness of the
collecting field. The office at Cleveland, together with a most
efficient and acceptable district secretary, was discontinued for
economy's sake. The expenses, however, had to be cut down in some way,
and so the burden was placed upon one of the secretaries in the New
York office. With multiform duties already upon the hands of each one
in the administration of the mission field, and almost constant Sunday
service among the contributing churches, it seemed almost impossible
to take up this new burden of work, which in some societies involves
the constant labor of a large number of secretaries. To accomplish an
undertaking which seemed almost impossible the pastors were conferred
with, and cordially and generously promised all the assistance within
their power for the American Missionary Association in its depleted
condition. Right royally did these good brethren redeem their pledge.

A series of Jubilee Field Days was planned and carried out with great
success and interest, largely through the co-operation of these
faithful brethren in the ministry of the churches in the interior.

Just a word concerning the plan adopted. A campaign of five weeks was
planned. Jubilee Field Day Rallies were to be held twice every weekday
except Saturday, and as many times on the Sabbath as possible. Ohio,
Michigan, and Indiana were the States to be reached.

The purpose of the campaign was to instruct and stimulate the churches
and congregations reached. It was also hoped that the collections
would pay all the expenses of this effort to scatter missionary
information and enthusiasm, and that the regular collections of the
churches would be largely increased.

The speakers consisted of the pastors of the several churches and
missionaries from the fields, and the writer of this article. Just a
word in reference to these friends who presented the work to the
churches. The value of the address of the pastor in each case was very
great. Standing on the vantage ground that an honored and beloved
pastor occupies in any church and community, his indorsement and
earnest and discriminating commendation carried greatest weight. I
desire thus publicly to recognize the service of those generous
brethren in the ministry to the American Missionary Association. That
service was large.

The colored work was represented by Rev. George V. Clark, pastor of
the Congregational Church at Memphis, Tenn. Born a slave, rescued by
an American Missionary Association missionary from the degrading
influences of a saloon into which he drifted as a lad when freedom
came and no other opening was before him, his testimony and earnest
appeal stirred the deepest convictions of his hearers. The quaint old
slave melodies, which Mr. Clark sometimes heard as a boy in slave
times, and often since by those who are freemen now, he rendered with
peculiar effect. The weird and quaint pathos of these songs coming
originally from the crushed and bleeding hearts of slaves, held the
large audiences in hushed and sympathetic attention. Is there anything
in the world like these slave songs sung by those who have known the
bitterness of slavery?

From far-away Dakota Miss Dora K. Dodge brought the message to these
several gatherings, of the discouragement and want, the hopefulness
and progress, of the Christian work among the Indians. Her mission,
seventy-five miles out on the prairie, with only Christian
Indians--John Bluecloud and his wife--for associates, is of unique
interest and importance. No one could have told the story of this
wonderful movement among the red people of the prairie with more
simple and earnest eloquence than did Miss Dodge.

Rev. W. G. Olinger, a native mountaineer, presented the work "Among
the American Highlanders." Born in the humble cabin of the
mountaineer, stirred from his earliest boyhood with the great desire
for education and improvement, he struggled up through great
discouragements, until to-day he can stand on any platform with
interest to those who hear and with honor to himself. His manly
presence is the illustration of the wonderful possibilities of these
mountaineers; and his story is their agonizing cry for the light and
opportunities which only an intelligent gospel and educational
privileges such as the American Missionary Association is bringing,
can satisfy.

The secretary, who had charge of the campaign, presented "The Claims
of the American Missionary Association on this Jubilee Year."

The immediate results of this series of Jubilee Field Days were most
encouraging. Nearly twenty thousand people gathered in the various
audiences. Lincoln Memorial Day, celebrated at Oberlin, was most
delightfully spent. Every service during the day, including
Sunday-school, Mission Circle, Endeavor Society, as well as church
services, was an American Missionary Association rally.

On the Sabbath large churches and towns were reached. During the week
important centers were selected, and many surrounding churches sent
pastors and delegates to the Jubilee Field Day services.

From a financial standpoint the result was also encouraging. More than
three times as much was gathered as the campaign cost, and pastors and
church members everywhere testified that the meetings were resultful
in spiritual uplift and blessing, as well as in stimulating interest
and greatly increased gifts.

The general feeling seemed to be that this was American Missionary
Association year, and that during this Jubilee season the specials
should float into this treasury and the regular contributions should
be greatly increased. While _en route_ the joyful message came to us
that the Board and the Home Missionary Society were both out of debt.
When announced from various pulpits by American Missionary Association
speakers, this glorious fact met with cordial applause. All the more
did it seem incumbent upon the churches to take hold of the American
Missionary Association, still burdened with its debt, and lift it out
of the slough of financial despond. This, however, is only the
reflection of the feeling among the churches throughout the land. The
determination to lift the debt of the American Missionary Association,
and to make it possible to continue at least its depleted work, is
universal. Special collections, regular contributions, and hundreds of
individuals taking the fifty-dollar shares in the Jubilee fund, will
accomplish this most desirable result.

The South.

THE OPENING CHURCH MISSIONS.

BY SECRETARY F. P. WOODBURY.


The Eureka Church-Arbor, shown below, sheltered the opening service of
the new plantation missions in Southern Georgia. The people came under
the shadows of the piney woods from every quarter. The first mission
church was organized under this rude booth. There the meetings
continued until the cold and rainy months of winter. Now, by the help
of a grant from the Church Building Society, a small church building
will speedily become the home of a beneficent church and school work.

[Illustration: THE EUREKA CHURCH-ARBOR.]

This church of the forest took its start from the earnest convictions
of its pastor, Rev. J. B. Fletcher. After long study of the New
Testament, with the help of few other books than his tattered Greek
lexicon, he resigned his ecclesiastical connection because he had
found, as he thought, the free church polity on Bible principles. His
discovery was substantially the Congregational system. He called his
first church "Eureka." It now has nine other churches associated in
the same work. A mission preacher, a devoted man residing near, a man
who is highly respected by all the people, has immediate charge of
the Eureka work and holds the Sunday-school and other services.

[Illustration: A PASTOR'S HOME.]

The abodes of many of the plantation preachers are as simple and
humble as those of their people. We give an illustration of one of
these homes. Usually there is a division into two or perhaps three
rooms. Sometimes a small lean-to is built at the side or end, for use
as kitchen. The chimney, erected on the outside, is often constructed
of clay bound with sticks. It starts in a broad fireplace of stone,
which warms the whole building. Some of these cabins have small glass
windows; others of them have only openings for windows, with wooden
shutters. In such dwellings there reside vast numbers of the
plantation preachers, and some of our own mission preachers, at the
early stages of mission work in the back country.

[Illustration: MARIETTA CHURCH AND PARSONAGE.]

The picture given herewith of the church, parsonage, and school, in
Marietta, Georgia, illustrates very many of the American Missionary
Association church missions in the South. A neat church, a plain but
comfortable house, with its adjoining school-room, are the type of the
improving influences in both religious and educational service, which
we seek to carry among these shadowed and suffering millions.

In both the Carolinas, as well as in Georgia, there is an awakening in
the hearts of the colored people, both in the towns and in the
country, for a better church life. This is inciting movements from the
centralized forms of church government, with their arbitrary methods
and hard taxation, into independency. Often the poverty of the people
prevents their attaining anything beyond present and scanty shelter
for their new free churches. The accompanying photograph is an
illustration of such a chapel among the plantations of South Carolina.

[Illustration: A SOUTH CAROLINA CHURCH.]

In very many parts of the plantation South, the very idea of a church
free from outside control and allied to education and morality, is
utterly unknown. Neither education nor morality form any constituent
element of the common church life. Their introduction is looked upon
with suspicion by the masses, and is met by hostility in every
possible form of persecution by many of the old-time preachers and
their personal adherents.

[Illustration: SCHOOL IN ANDERSONVILLE, GA].

Nothing more contributes to the introduction of better forms of
church life than do those mission schools which awaken the desire for
something better in religion than the senseless and corrupt "old-time"
ways. Such a school as that in Andersonville, Ga., is the initiative
of a church mission. School education is of little advantage unless it
is linked with moral training; and there is no moral training
comparable with that of a pure and true Christian church. Our mission
school teachers call for and need the re-enforcement of gospel
preaching on the Lord's day, and the faithful work of a pastor during
the week. A great deal of hard work in the school would be frittered
away and lost without the distinctive church work which must
supplement, and confirm it. To send the pupils back into the Egyptian
darkness of most plantation and country churches is, for vast numbers,
to throw away all that has been done for them. That they feel this is
shown by the frequent and earnest appeals which come from them to have
virtuous and educated ministers sent for the starting of better
churches among their homes.

[Illustration: SCHOOL AT KING'S MOUNTAIN]

While this is the narrow and local influence of our smaller schools,
it is also the broader and deeper influence of our larger schools,
like that at All Healing, N. C. (King's Mountain P. O.) Here the
religious life is intensified. A number of devoted teachers supplement
each other's work. A unique Congregational church has been formed, its
pastor being the principal of the school, who adds this work to all
his other services. The influence of the constant religious work done
in this church-school and school-church is felt a hundred miles
around. Young men and young women go out with higher ideals, and they
awaken a demand in their home neighborhoods for both religion and
education of a higher character. It is not too much to say that such
work as that of Miss Cathcart and her fellow teachers at King's
Mountain tends toward a general advance of the communities from which
her pupils come.

[Illustration: HAGAN COUNC'L.]

In Georgia, after the Eureka church movement was noised about, Mr.
Fletcher received and now receives calls from every side, chiefly from
the plantation people. At Piney Grove, a preaching station was begun
in an old dwelling house, and a little church of twelve members is the
result. At Shady Grove, ten miles away, a small church building is
going up for the brotherhood there. The ground was given and the work
of building is carried on by a respectable colored farmer of the
neighborhood, who with many of his neighbors welcomes a church
fellowship which stands for education and pure religion. At Alford, in
the adjoining county, there is now a membership of thirty-two, for
whose use a comfortable church building is furnished by the white
people. This, with Nellwood as an out-station, will probably soon
receive an excellent pastor, trained in our Congregational ways and
principles. A beginning has been made at Portal, twelve miles beyond.
In the next county westward, the church work began at Swainsboro with
twenty-nine members, at Kemp with seventeen members, near Garfield
with thirteen members, and at Pilgrim with twenty-three members.

Word comes to us that Mr. Fletcher, who is covering three counties in
his work, has lost his faithful horse. This quite disables him from
service. His fields lie at distances which make walking impossible,
being from ten to fifty miles apart. The same day with this loss a
member of the family, a young man, was brought home suffering from a
broken leg. Are there not means which can reach us in the form of a
special gift for the emergency of this faithful pioneer worker?
Anything received beyond the immediate stress of need, will be placed
to the support of his work.

The Hagan Council, called for the orderly recognition of these poor
struggling pioneer churches, met in an old half-ruined school-house,
as shown in the picture given herewith. It was a humble place, and
they were humble bodies of poor people who thus asked recognition from
the Congregational churches of the land. But it is not for us to
despise the poor. Has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in
faith, and heirs of the kingdom? That little group in front of that
poor old school-house may become historic as the precursor of a great
movement of blessing to millions among the poorest of the poor in our
nation.

GRACIOUS REVIVAL IN SELMA, ALA.

BY REV. A. T. BURNELL.


You will be interested to hear of the gracious revival we have had the
past three weeks under the lead of the English Evangelist, Rev. James
Wharton. Over 400 have professed Christ, and of these 140 were
enrolled in Burrell School. To the very end of the meetings,
"mourners" came forward, once in the church as many as fifty; but this
was exceeded in immediate results at two schools where as many as
fifty accepted Christ, after the briefest address. Following the
Oberlin plan, I offered prayer with each class one day; the next, I
suspended my recitations for a continuous prayer-meeting, permitting
pupils to elect this instead of a class or study-period (certain
grades, certain hours). At another time, instead of chapel the
grade-teachers retained the Christians while the rest were addressed
in the chapel,--the majority falling to their knees for prayer to rise
in peace. Of course we have had regular prayer-meetings, with
volunteer room gatherings at noon and like groups in the yards at
intermission. When, on account of the late meetings each night, it
seemed best to close at noon, most of the school gathered for a
meeting in the chapel; and, with several after meetings, large numbers
spent that half-holiday in the building, praying for and laboring with
classmates. A member of Grade Eleven, for whom special effort had
been made, came out at this time.

Some of the converts have made detailed confession of sins (stealing,
_e.g._); some who have been neglectful of school privileges have
returned to get the religious impetus; and at least two that had been
dismissed for meanness have experienced a change of heart. We shall
look for permanent results, and work to that end with hope; yet this
people are so emotional and so stolid! so ready to move along a
certain line in a body, but indifferent to duty when it leads along an
uninteresting path of individual effort. Indeed, the home life of many
is unfavorable to genuine Christianity; some being persecuted, even,
because they have not seen a vision, till they are made to believe
they "have got nothing."

Mr. Wharton preaches the pure and simple gospel plainly and vividly;
is attractive in person and of commanding presence. At his departure
there were many expressions of regard and grateful remembrance, and he
will always have a warm place in the affections of Selma people, who
have been impressed in so short a time by the life and words of this
man of God.

COTTON VALLEY, ALA.

BY A TEACHER.


I have been asked to tell something of the work and school in Cotton
Valley. Hence I send a little description of it as it appears to a new
teacher, just having entered the missionary field.

There are many features about the work here that make it a most
interesting one. First, it is situated in a dense black belt, where
the people are anxious to improve, and are appreciative of all that is
done for them. Next, Cotton Valley is quiet and retired, being forty
miles from Montgomery, nine from Union Springs, and thirteen from
Tuskegee; so that, while we are enabled to teach without interruptions
that break into school life in cities, we are yet not so far removed
as to be incommoded when business necessitates our going to a city.

Doubtless Miss Lilla V. Davis, the pioneer, founder, and principal of
our school is well known to most of the friends and helpers of the
American Missionary Association, but, for the sake of those who are
not so well informed, and because hers is a story worthy of being told
anew, I will say a word of her whom all Cotton Valley delights to
honor. She, ten years ago, left her home in Boston, Mass., and coming
down here under the most adverse circumstances, and in the midst of
the lowest humanity, established this school. Her teaching in those
days was not so much from books, but she went into the homes of the
people and made them feel that she was one of them. She talked and
read to them, taught them the rules of decency and virtue, and that
cleanliness is next to godliness. Thus, step by step has she been
leading them on until now, instead of a valley of ignorance, it is "as
a city set on a hill, whose light cannot be hid," for instead of a
one-room-log-cabin we have a nice, comfortable school building,
planned and furnished in modern style. I mean by this, that what we
have is up-to-date and not that we have all we need, for our largest
room, the one we call and use as our chapel, needs settees,
blackboards, maps, and lights; and last but not least, we need a
piano, as at present our only musical instrument is a baby organ,
which is now so nearly worn out that many of the reeds instead of
responding to the touch of the solicitous performer sit in silence,
considering themselves too aged to jump up and down, and take part in
such active service.

Our school this year is larger than ever, and our students, I think,
would compare well with those of more favored schools in cities. The
present enrollment is nearly two hundred, and when the weather is
good, and all are in, we find the work rather heavy, as there are only
three teachers, and we all believe in thorough work.

We have a large and interesting Sunday School to which the parents as
well as the children come; also a Christian Endeavor Society, and a
Circle of King's Daughters.

Perhaps it would be interesting to say, that the relation of the white
people of the settlement to the school is most friendly. They respect
Miss Davis to the highest degree, and are willing and glad to show any
favors to her or her teachers.

Thus far, I have shown you only the favorable side of the picture, but
I would beg my readers to remember that it has also a painful side.
Those we are teaching are the children of ancestors who have lived for
centuries in darkness and ignorance, with only eleven years of light;
and there is still a great work to be done here. We find it necessary
to instruct them, not only in books, but along the lines of all the
virtues which go to make a man a man, and a woman a woman.

IMPARTIAL TESTIMONY.

BY REV. VINCENT MOSES, NEWBURY, MASS.


My wife and I recently spent about four weeks in New Orleans, La.
While we were there, Straight University was constantly under our
observation; and, without suggestion from any one, it comes to mind
that testimony to the efficiency of American Missionary Association
work in Straight would be welcome to you.

We not only attended more than once the general morning devotional
exercises in the "Daniel Hand Preparatory School" and the "Central
Building," but were also present during a recitation to nearly every
teacher in the Preparatory, Grammar, Normal, College Preparatory,
College and Theological Departments. The departments of music,
woodworking, sewing and printing, and also the Boarding Department
came under our observation.

The impression made upon us throughout was most favorable. The claims
of the catalogue are fully sustained in every particular. We have been
familiar with work in all these grades in the schools of several
Northern States; but we have never seen more thorough work, never a
school on the whole more satisfactory in deportment and scholarship.
We cannot compare this with other American Missionary Association
institutions. This is the only one we have visited. So we are glad to
let this represent them all, and confess to a surprise in finding that
we had never known better schools.

WHAT OUR GRADUATES ARE DOING.

FROM GRADUATES OF STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY, NEW ORLEANS.


I.

     "I am principal of the public schools of Vicksburg, Miss. I
     have been teaching fourteen years, having had charge of my
     present work nine years. I have under my present charge eight
     hundred pupils, all the school can accommodate. Several hundred
     have been turned away."

II.

     "Am editor of the _Southwestern Christian Advocate_, and
     practicing physician and minister. Have taught school in
     Alabama and Louisiana."

III.

     "My present occupation is clerk in the War Department,
     Washington, D. C. I have taught three years in New Orleans. I
     graduated as doctor of medicine, April 13, from the medical
     department of Howard University."

IV.

     "I am principal of the Harper Industrial Institute, Baton
     Rouge, La. Have taught almost continuously since graduating in
     1879. For the American Missionary Association I entertain a
     feeling of the greatest possible gratitude. What little I am I
     owe to the training of dear old Straight."

V.

     "I have been until last spring principal of the colored schools
     of Manhattan, Kansas, since 1885."

VI.

     "The very name of the dear old institution is sweet to me, and
     while those who guarded the old mother in the memorable past
     have somewhat vanished, the purposes for which she was
     instituted are being vigorously pushed and great good
     accomplished. Many of her sons and daughters can be found
     throughout this Southland engaged in the various pursuits of
     life, doing a grand work for Christ and humanity. All honor to
     the American Missionary Association for this excellent school,
     and incessant praises to Him who guides and directs her
     efforts."

VII.

     "I am instructor of ancient languages in Wiley University,
     Tex.; have been since 1887. I am a member of the Louisiana
     Conference."

The following extract is of special importance as showing the breadth
and completeness of the system of instruction of Straight University
and the economy upon which it is based:

     "I am always glad to do whatever lies in my power that will in
     any way be beneficial to Straight University, my _alma mater_.
     I am, as you know, a normal graduate of 1891. Though I had
     never before taken the first thought of learning anything about
     wood-working, I thought I would go into the shop the first day
     anyway; and I shall always be heartily thankful that I did so.
     From that day to the end of my course, without interruption to
     my studies, I worked in the carpenter shop, and acquired such a
     knowledge of carpentry that I am now able to support myself by
     following that trade. Still more, from the knowledge I gained
     of making pieces of furniture, such as center-tables,
     washstands, etc., I think I could be useful in the cabinet
     trade."

IX.

The following gives some idea of what the department in theology is
doing:

     "Having a desire to do something for Christ and humanity, I
     began the study of theology and other studies at Straight, that
     I might be thoroughly equipped, 'a workman that needeth not to
     be ashamed.' I was compelled to give up for two years, and it
     seemed to me that there was no use of my trying further, when
     just then through the dark cloud the sun shone again, and I
     hope now, if life lasts, to keep on till I finish the course.
     All that I am, or ever expect to be, is due to Straight
     University. May God bless her and the many friends who have
     made it possible for us to attend."

ALL HEALING, NORTH CAROLINA.


During the summer about forty of our pupils taught in the public
schools; some had eighty or ninety scholars. In this way our school
really influences many whom we cannot reach. It is so good to see the
interest our young teachers take in their work and how, when they find
a bright boy or girl, they always try the first thing to induce that
one to come to school. Then, too, we see a growing desire among the
scholars to come into school early in the fall, and we rejoice in a
family of fifty-seven six weeks earlier than we had the same last
year.

The richest blessing of the year has begun to fall upon us, the
presence of the Holy Spirit leading souls to Christ. During this month
five have felt that God had forgiven their sins. Is not that enough to
compensate us for anything we may give up to engage in the work?

PLEASANT HILL, TENNESSEE.


A boy we could not receive, although we would have been glad to have
done so, said he had worked all summer for his share of a crop which
was about 100 bushels of corn. He would have about twenty bushels of
the corn left after he had bought himself a few clothes, which he must
have if he came to school, and he thought he ought to help his mother
a little. It was his only chance to get what he so much desired. He
realized that twenty bushels of corn, worth only about $5.00, was very
little for him to do for himself. He would try to prove himself worthy
of any help we could give him.

Still another boy writes: "It is not much I can do for myself, for I
have not been able to find anything to do to get any money, although I
have tried hard. But a friend has just given me a chance to assist him
in his school for a couple of months. I don't know how much he will
pay me, but you shall have _every cent_ I _do_ get. I do want to come
into school, I need the education so much; I want to make a true man."

The Indians.


There has been an interesting revival at Ponca Church, Nebraska, under
the direction of Rev. James Garvie, our Indian pastor.

The friends who attended the annual meeting of the Association at
Lowell will remember Mr. Garvie very pleasantly, as he was one of the
speakers on that occasion. He is as successful in the great work which
comes to him, as the pastor of one of our churches on the prairie, as
he was in telling the story of the work among his people to Eastern
congregations.

Even the building of a barn at the prairie mission may be turned to
the spiritual advantage of the Indian people, as is proved by the
experience of Miss Mary P. Lord at Flying By's Village, N. D. The
following extract, from a recent letter of hers, tells the story most
interestingly. Frank and Daisy are her horses, who are really
four-footed missionaries. Miss Lord writes: "On Sunday the ponies took
me twelve miles to conduct service at Oak Creek Sub-Agency, where my
people were gathered for the Monday morning issue of rations. Service
over at noon, a drink of water and a feed of grain, and then two hours
and a half later we were twenty miles away to attend afternoon service
at Little-Eagle's village, where I played the organ for the English
singing of the boarding-school children there. Yesterday they brought
me to Fort Yates, thirty miles."

HUT AND HEAVEN.

BY REV. C. L. HALL, FT. BERTHOLD, N. D.


Three years ago in our visit to the Indian homes, we found
Netkuschiripas (Little Eagle) on his bed unable to get out of the
house. Mary, his wife, washed for white people, hoed corn, and
tenderly cared for him. He told me he believed in Jesus and would join
us as soon as he could come out. It did not seem that he ever would
get better then, but his faith put new life into his body, and two
years and a half ago he was baptized in church, and got about to do a
little work now and then. This fall his working days came to an end.
He could only lie on his bed or sit in the sun at the door. Mary had
to haul the firewood and nurse him, as well as work out. For a while
they stayed at a neighbor's house, but an old Indian woman insisted
that he should wear his beads and other heathen adornments. He refused
to do so, saying that now he was a different person. As this annoyance
was kept up he and Mary left and stayed by themselves in a dug-out on
the south side of a bank on the edge of a willow bottom. His bed was a
few boards with a straw mattress and a few quilts. The room was
lighted by a single sash--the rude shelter of two of God's children.
When he felt himself sinking, he said: I do not know what God's will
for me is, but whatever it is I am ready. I have no fears. The day
before he died he said: I have one heart. I trust only in Jesus; I
have said this to you often. We laid him away just after the morning
meeting last Sunday. This is not extraordinary; we are glad so many
are like John and Mary. Twice the gates have opened this winter for
us, and now part of our church gather above and part here. Five more
are to confess their faith at the next communion. Pray for these
little ones.

The Chinese.

THE LOS ANGELES MISSION.

BY. REV. WM. C. POND, D.D.


An interesting letter from Mrs. Rice, wife of Rev. O. V. Rice, who has
charge of our mission at this prosperous and ambitious metropolis of
Southern California, prompts me to give my space this month to a
review of our work there. It had already begun when, twenty-two years
ago, I became superintendent. I tried to visit it in the spring of
1874, but a severe storm on our usually placid Pacific delayed our
steamer so long that I could spend only a few hours there. This was
sufficient, however, to show me that we had a good teacher and some
very promising pupils, but an indifference to contend with on the part
of American Christians which was both surprising and painful.

A few months after this I heard that Rev. Ira M. Condit, a missionary
recently returned from China, able to talk the Chinese language
fluently, and a very estimable brother, had gone to Los Angeles to
establish a Presbyterian mission. I did not hear of it by letter from
him nor from any one connected with the Presbyterian work in this
State. Denominational comity just then had not reached in the minds of
our Presbyterian brethren sufficient dignity to call even for a bow in
recognition. But I waived this matter, and believing that, with his
manifest advantages, he could do better work than we, and that there
was not room enough in the field, as it then was, for two missions, I
turned over to him our whole school--pupils, teacher, and whatever
conveniences or good-will we had gathered--and retired from the
locality. It was about two months only when I heard of six or eight
conversions in the Presbyterian Chinese mission of Los Angeles, but
they were the very ones of whom our teacher had spoken hopefully to me
on my visit to the city.

An interval of several years occurred. The great boom came, and Los
Angeles sprang to the front among the inland cities of the State and
boasted that before long San Francisco would be one of its suburbs.
The Chinese population increased to about 6,000. Among these were many
of our own brethren and several who were members of my own church.
They pleaded for a Congregational mission, and showed that because the
two Presbyterian missions were at one end of the Chinese quarter, and
there was nothing of the sort at the other end, nearly a mile distant,
there was a large field for us where we would come into no
competition, and where all that we might do would be a distinct
addition to the work done for Christ among their countrymen. We
yielded to their persuasions and found their prediction amply
verified. Our school became at once the largest and our work the most
active and fruitful in the city. In the four months ending with
August 31, 1888, 133 pupils were enrolled, and the average membership
month by month was 69. Street-preaching, hand-to-hand evangelistic
work, and the skillful, faithful labor of our teacher, Mrs. Sheldon,
and our enthusiastic helper, Loo Quong, were used of God for the
conversion of many souls.

But as in other specially delightful places for homes, persons
multiplied who desired to enter into this missionary work. Instead of
three, there came to be six or eight missions there. Competition
ensued. Our school, though comparing well with any, was reduced in
size and influence, and as we began to be straitened for funds and
there were many points where no one was caring for Chinese souls, our
aid was withdrawn and I supposed the work would cease. Not so. Our
Chinese brethren clung to each other and to their own mission work.
They rented quarters neither spacious nor comfortable, but cheap, and
contrived, with the aid of one true-hearted Christian woman, to keep
up their school, maintain their Association, add four members to it as
converts to the Christian life, and present seven of their number to
the First Congregational Church for baptism. We felt that a mission
with such "grit and grace" deserved to live. _Long may it live!_

Three persons converted at this mission have been brought into our
work as missionary helpers. Many have testified for Christ in their
own land.

At present it is in excellent working order and our Christian Chinese
are enthusiastic, generous, and at peace among themselves. Let me copy
a few sentences from a letter from one of them who was temporarily at
work at Pasadena. "I am very sorry for I left our school. Pray God for
me that I may be back to it again. You will be kind and teach our
people; that is such good work for you. God will want thus such person
[_i.e._, God wants persons who do as you do.--W. C. P.] You very much
interest our people. May God reward it to you! Before I went to the
mission school I never thought to be a Christian; now I did do it. I
am very thankful God has direct me out from the superstition to find
pathway about the truth, God and Heavenly Father. Now I am feel such
good comfort in my mind, but I do not satisfy [I am not satisfied] to
know the salvation alone, but needed you pray for my countrymen that
they all find life in Jesus Christ."

And now for an extract, briefer than I desired to make, from Mrs.
Rice's letter: "Last night we gave a farewell reception to our
brother, Yon Mon, who is about to leave for China. The brethren seized
this opportunity to present to a lady from Norristown, Pa., who has
kindly helped our work, a very nice letter of thanks with their names
signed to it. A gentleman who came to the city with her, and who is
about to open a fine store here, attended her to the mission house,
out of courtesy but very reluctantly, for he was bitterly opposed to
Chinese and to any and all efforts made for them. The brethren took
him for a friend and when introduced shook hands. He said it 'was as
much as his life was worth' to extend his hand in response to theirs.
But the same sense of courtesy constrained him to come with his friend
a second evening, and at its close he asked if he might be permitted
to say a word 'just to the boys.' Whereupon he expressed his pleasure
at all he had seen since coming into the school, and advised the boys
to keep right on doing right. They would meet bitter enemies among the
Americans, but not to mind them but go right forward. Then he
announced that if by February 5 we would have thirty regular pupils,
he would make the school 'a handsome present.' I wish some of the
other opponents of our work could in like manner be _compelled_ to see
our schools. Seeing would be believing, would it not?"

The latest contribution of our Los Angeles Mission to our general work
is Jue See, who has come to take Yip Bow's place (Yip Bow also having
come from the same mission) as helper in Oakland and at the West
School in this city, while Yip Bow goes to Sacramento. I am greatly
pleased with him. He will, when trained for the work (and we train for
work mainly _by working_), make one of the best of our Chinese
helpers.

I add just one word of good news. Our teachers are _all_ paid in full
for last year's work. Their faith has not been put to shame. Two of
our Chinese helpers still lack something, and two other creditors will
probably have to make large donations in order to square their
accounts, but I _know_ that _one_ of them will not complain, and the
other will be doing only what she promised, and while I fear it may be
a hardship, it is no greater hardship than almost every landlord or
landlady, in these days of pressure, has been forced to undergo. So I
feel like singing the Doxology!

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
