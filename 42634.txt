EPITAPHS ON MEN.


An old American epitaph:

    Under this sod, and under these trees,
    Lieth the body of Samuel Pease;
    He is not in this hole, but only his pod,
    He shelled out his soul and went up to God.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another version:

    Under this sod, beneath these trees,
    Lyeth the pod of Solomon Pease.
    Pease is not here, but only his pod,
    He shelled out his soul, which went straight to his God.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Johnny Haskell
    A lying, thieving, cheating rascal;
    He always lied, and now he lies,
    He has no soul and cannot rise.

       *       *       *       *       *

An Irishman wrote the following oft-quoted lines for his epitaph:

    Here I lays,
    Paddy O'Blase;
    My body quite at its aise is,
    With the tip of my nose
    And the points of my toes
    Turned up to the roots of the daisies.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Ballyporen (Ire.) churchyard, on Teague O'Brian, written by himself:

    Here I at length repose,
    My spirit now at aise is;
    With the tips of my toes
    And the point of my nose
    Turned up to the roots of the daisies.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies Richard Fothergill who met a violent death. He was
    shot by a colt's revolver, old kind, brass mounted, and of such is
    the kingdom of heaven.

       *       *       *       *       *

A Cornwall churchyard is enriched with the following dainty verses:

    Here lies entombed one Roger Morton,
    Whose sudden death was early brought on;
    Trying one day his corn to mow off,
    The razor slipped and cut his toe off.

    The toe, or rather what it grew to,
    An inflammation quickly flew to;
    The parts they took to mortifying,
    And poor dear Roger took to dying.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The death angel struck Alexander McGlue
    And gave him protracted repose;
    He wore a checked shirt and a No. 9 shoe
    And had a pink wart on his nose.

    No doubt he is happy a-dwelling in space
    Over on the evergreen shore.
    His friends are informed that his funeral takes place
    At precisely a quarter past four.

       *       *       *       *       *

At Brightwell, Oron. On S. Rumbold, born February, 1582:

    He lived one hundred and five,
    Sanguine and strong;
    A hundred to five,
    You live not so long.
    Dy'd March 4, 1687.

       *       *       *       *       *

    This is all that remains of poor Ben Hough
    He had forty-nine years and that was enough.
    Of worldly goods he had his share,
    And now he's gone to the Devil's snare.

       *       *       *       *       *

In an old cemetery in Lyme, Conn.:

    Close behind this stone
    Here lies alone
    Captain Reynolds Marvin,
    Expecting his wife
    When ends her life,
    And we both are freed from sarvin'.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Captain Gervase Scrope, of the family of
    the Scropes of Bilton, in the county of York, who departed this life
    26th August, Anno Domini 1705, aged 66.

    An epitaph written by himself, in the agony and doloroes paines
    of the gout, and died soon after.

    Here lies an old toss'd tennis ball.
    Was racketted from spring to fall.
    With so much heat and so much frost,
    Time's arms for shame grew ty'rd at last.
    Four kings in camps he truly served,
    And from his loyalty ne'er swerved.
    Father ruin'd, the son slighted,
    And from the Crown ne'er requited.
    Loss of Estate, Relations, Blood,
    Was too well known, but did no good.
    With long campaigns and paines o' th' Gout,
    He could no longer hold it out.
    Always a restless life he led,
    Never at quiet till quite dead.
    He married in his latter days
    One who exceeds the common praise;
    But wanting health still to make known
    Her true affection and his own,
    Death kindly came, all wants supply'd,
    By giving Rest which life deny'd.

       *       *       *       *       *

From a tombstone near Williamsport, Penn.:

                        Sacred to the Memory of
                             HENRY HARRIS,
                 Born June 27th, 1821, of Henry Harris
                           And Jane his Wife.
   Died on the 4th of May, 1837, by the kick of a colt in his bowels.

    Peaceable and quiet, a friend to his father and mother, and
    respected by all who knew him, and went to the world where horses
    don't kick, where sorrow and weeping is no more.

       *       *       *       *       *

    YATTENDON BERKS. 1770.

    O Death, thy call was soon,
      My pains were smart,
    But I, prepared,
      Was ready to depart
    In hopes to Heaven, there to sit
      With Saints and Angels bright,
    Singing Hallelujahs
      In which I took delight.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Tread softly mortals o'er the bones
    Of this world's wonder, Captain Jones,
    Who told his glorious deeds to many
    Yet never was believed by any.
    Posterity let this suffice
    He swore all's true, yet here he lies.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of John Bidwell,
    Who, when in life, wished his neighbors no evil.
      In hopes up to jump
      When he hears the last trump
    And triumph over Death and the Devil.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies David Garrick, describe me who can,
    An abridgement of all that was pleasant in man.

                                                          --_Goldsmith._

       *       *       *       *       *

    Beneath this stone of granite hard
    Lies my own beloved pard.

       *       *       *       *       *

    ON A MR. PECK

    Here lies a Peck, which some men say
    Was first of all a Peck of clay;
    This wrought with skill divine, while fresh,
    Became a curious Peck of flesh.
    Through various forms its Maker ran,
    Then adding breath made Peck a man;
    Full fifty years Peck felt life's troubles
    Till death relieved a Peck of troubles;
    Then fell poor Peck, as all things must.
    And here he lies,--a Peck of dust.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies John Hill, a man of skill,
      His age was five times ten,
    He ne'er did good, nor ever would,
      Had he lived as long again

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of John Smith. Had he lived till he got
    ashore, he would have been buried here.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies Dr. Trollope,
    Who made these stones roll up;
    He took a dose of jalop,
    And God took his soul up.

       *       *       *       *       *

    John Macpherson
    Was a remarkable person;
      He stood six feet two
      Without his shoe,
      And he was slew
      At Waterloo.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies John Auricular,
    Who in the ways of the Lord walked perpendicular.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Don't weep for me, my wife most dear,
      But still remember I lie here,
    Altho' cut down when little past my bloom,
      Shed not one tear upon my tomb.

       *       *       *       *       *

From Harrow Churchyard :

    In memory of Mr. John Port, son of Mr. Thomas Port, of
    Burton-on-Trent, who, not far from this town, had both his legs
    severed from his body by the Railway Train. With greatest fortitude
    he bore a second amputation by the surgeons, and died from loss of
    blood.

    Bright rose the morn, and vigorous rose poor Port,
    Gay on the train he used his wonted sport.
    When noon arrived, a mangled form they bore,
    With pain distorted and o'erwhelmed with gore.
    When evening came to close the fatal day,
    A mutilated corpse the sufferer lay.

       *       *       *       *       *

A miser:

    Here lies one who for medicine would not give
      A little gold, and so his life he lost:
    I fancy now he'd wish again to live
      Could he but guess how much his funeral cost.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Jonathan Near
    Whose mouth it stretched from ear to ear.
    Tread softly, stranger, o'er this wonder,
    For if he yawns, you're gone, by thunder!

       *       *       *       *       *

Truro, Nova Scotia:

    Don't weep for me, Eliza dear,
    I am not dead, but sleeping here.
    As I am now so you must be,
    Prepare for death and follow me.

    OLIVER P. DONNALLY.

    A son that has been ever kind
    Has gone and left us all behind;
    Cease to weep, my Mother dear,
    For I am wrapped up and lying here.
    Dear Oliver has gone to rest
    In Heaven above with Angels blest;
    A place is vacant at our hearts.
    Which never can be filled.

       *       *       *       *       *

From Banbury Churchyard:

    To the memory of Ric. Richards, who by a Gangreen first lost a
    Toe, afterwards a Leg, and lastly his Life on the 7th day of April,
    1656.

    Ah! cruel Death, to make 3 Meals of one!
    To taste and eat, and Eat 'till all was gone.
    But know, thou Tyrant! when the Trump shall call,
    He'll find his Feet, and stand when thou shalt fall.

       *       *       *       *       *

The graveyard at Wigtown, Gallowayshire, Scotland, furnish the two
following:

    Here lies the corps of Andrew Cowan, of Croft Angry, who died
    June 6th, 1776, aged 70 years. And his son William lies beside him,
    who died the 21st February, 1778, aged 17 years.

    And his son John of honest fame,
    Of stature small and a leg lame;
    Content he was with portion small,
    Keeped shop in Wigtown, and that's all.
    Died August 21st, 1779, aged 32 years.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Plymouth old churchyard :

    Here lies the body of
      Thomas Vernon,
    The only _surviving_ son of
      Admiral Vernon.

       *       *       *       *       *

In New Hampshire:

    Here lies old Caleb Ham,
      By trade a bum.
    When Caleb dyed the Devil cryed:
      "Come, Caleb, come."

       *       *       *       *       *

Lord Brougham (for an orator):

    Here, reader, turn your weeping eyes,
      My fate a useful moral teaches;
    The hole in which my body lies
      Would not contain one half my speeches.

       *       *       *       *       *

On a bachelor:

    At threescore winters' end I died,
      A cheerless being, sole and sad;
    The nuptial knot I never tied,
      And wish my father never had.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Henry Round
    Who went to sea and never was found.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Thetford Churchyard, Norfolk:

    My grandfather was buried here,
    My cousin Jane and two uncles dear;
    My father perished with an inflammation in his thighs
    And my sister dropped down dead in the Minories;
    But the reason why I'm here interr'd, according to my thinking,
    Is owing to my good living and hard drinking.
    If, therefore, good Christians, you wish to live long,
    Don't drink too much wine, brandy, gin, or anything strong.

       *       *       *       *       *

The celebrated Daniel Lambert's epitaph, St. Martin's, Stamford Baron,
England:

                 _Altus in animo, in corpore maximus._

               In remembrance of that prodigy in Nature,

                            DANIEL LAMBERT.

   A native of Leicester, who was possessed of an exalted, convivial
                                 mind;
              and in personal greatness had no competitor;
  He measured 3 ft. 1 in. round the legs, 9 ft. 4 in. round the body,
                       and weighed 52 st. 11 lb.

             He departed this life on the 21st June, 1809,
                             Aged 39 years.

    As a testimony of respect, this stone is erected by his friend
    in Leicester.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Man's life's a vapor, and full of woes,
    He cuts a caper, and down he goes.

       *       *       *       *       *

John Knott, of Sheffield, England:

    Here lies a man that was Knott born,
    His father was Knott before him,
    He lived Knott, and did Knott die,
    Yet underneath this stone doth lie.

       *       *       *       *       *

In a French cemetery there are the following concise inscriptions on one
tombstone. The epitaph is on husband and wife:

    I am anxiously expecting you.--A. D. 1827.
    Here I am!--A. D. 1867.

       *       *       *       *       *

    GOVERNOR STOUGHTON.

    A man to wedlock unknown,
    Devout in religion,
    Renowned for virtue,
    Famous for erudition,
    Acute in judgment.

       *       *       *       *       *

An old man:

    Lively I walked life's journey through
    Till I arrived at eighty-two;
    Then calm descended here to rest
    In hopes to be forever blest.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hackett to the author of Dr. Mead's epitaph:

    Mead's not dead then, you say, only sleeping a little;
    Why, egad, sir, you've hit it off there to a tittle;
    Yet, friend, his awaking I very much doubt--
    Pluto knows who he's got, and will ne'er let him out.

       *       *       *       *       *

Oldtown, Maine:

    ORONO, AN INDIAN CHIEF, 1801.

    Safe lodg'd within his blanket, here below,
    Lie the last relics of old Orono;
    Worn down with toil and care, he in a trice
    Exchang'd his wigwam for a paradise.

       *       *       *       *       *

From St. Philip's Churchyard, Birmingham:

    To the memory of James Baker, who died January 27th, 1781.

    O cruel Death, how cou'd you be so unkind
    To take him before and leave me behind?
    You should have taken both of us, if either,
    Which would have been more pleasing to the survivor.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Died, on the 14th inst., Henry Wilkins Glyn, aged 3 days and
    7 hours. After a long and painful illness, which he bore with
    Christian fortitude, this youthful martyr departed to his rest.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Jonathan Stout.
    He fell in the water and never got out,
    And still is supposed to be floating about.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies one Box within another;
          The one of wood
          Was very good;
    We cannot say so much for t' other.




Epitaphs on Women.


An epitaph from an Irish graveyard:

    Here lies the body of Lady O'Looney,
      Grand-niece to Edmund Burke,
      Commonly called "the sublime."
    She was bland, passionate, and religious,
                Also,
    She painted in water-colors.
                Also,
    She sent several articles to the Exhibition.
      She was first cousin to Lady Jones.
    And of such is the kingdom of heaven.
                                      Amen.

       *       *       *       *       *

At St. Albans:

    Sacred to the memory of Miss Martha Gwynn,
    Who was so very pure within,
    She burst the outer shell of sin,
    And hatched herself a cherubim.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is an epitaph of an eccentric character that may be seen on a
tombstone at the burying-grounds near Hoosick Falls, New York. It reads:

    Ruth Sprague, Daughter of Gibson and Elizabeth Sprague. Died
    June 11, 1846, aged 9 years, 4 months, and 3 days.

    She was stolen from the grave by Roderick R. Clow, dissected at
    Dr. P. M. Armstrong's office, in Hoosick, N. Y., from which place
    her mutilated remains were obtained and deposited here.

    Her body dissected by fiendish man,
      Her bones anatomized,

    Her life to God she did resign,
      And angels bore her soul away.
    The grave her body now confines
      Shall rise triumphant the last day.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
