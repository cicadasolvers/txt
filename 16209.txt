LECTURE I.--INTRODUCTORY
ON POETRY IN GENERAL.


The best general notion which I can give of poetry is, that it is the
natural impression of any object or event, by its vividness exciting an
involuntary movement of imagination and passion, and producing, by
sympathy, a certain modulation of the voice, or sounds, expressing it.

In treating of poetry, I shall speak first of the subject-matter of
it, next of the forms of expression to which it gives birth, and
afterwards of its connection with harmony of sound.

Poetry is the language of the imagination and the passions.  It
relates to whatever gives immediate pleasure or pain to the human mind.
It comes home to the bosoms and businesses of men; for nothing but what
so comes home to them in the most general and intelligible shape, can be
a subject for poetry.  Poetry is the universal language which the heart
holds with nature and itself.  He who has a contempt for poetry, cannot
have much respect for himself, or for any thing else.  It is not a mere
frivolous accomplishment, (as some persons have been led to imagine) the
trifling amusement of a few idle readers or leisure hours--it has been
the study and delight of mankind in all ages.  Many people suppose that
poetry is something to be found only in books, contained in lines of ten
syllables, with like endings: but wherever there is a sense of beauty,
or power, or harmony, as in the motion of a wave of the sea, in the
growth of a flower that "spreads its sweet leaves to the air, and
dedicates its beauty to the sun,"--_there_ is poetry, in its birth.  If
history is a grave study, poetry may be said to be a graver: its
materials lie deeper, and are spread wider.  History treats, for the most
part, of the cumbrous and unwieldly masses of things, the empty cases in
which the affairs of the world are packed, under the heads of intrigue
or war, in different states, and from century to century: but there is
no thought or feeling that can have entered into the mind of man, which
he would be eager to communicate to others, or which they would listen
to with delight, that is not a fit subject for poetry.  It is not a
branch of authorship: it is "the stuff of which our life is made." The
rest is "mere oblivion," a dead letter: for all that is worth
remembering in life, is the poetry of it.  Fear is poetry, hope is
poetry, love is poetry, hatred is poetry; contempt, jealousy, remorse,
admiration, wonder, pity, despair, or madness, are all poetry.  Poetry is
that fine particle within us, that expands, rarefies, refines, raises
our whole being: without it "man's life is poor as beast's." Man is a
poetical animal: and those of us who do not study the principles of
poetry, act upon them all our lives, like Moliere's _Bourgeois
Gentilhomme_, who had always spoken prose without knowing it.  The child
is a poet in fact, when he first plays at hide-and-seek, or repeats the
story of Jack the Giant-killer; the shepherd-boy is a poet, when he
first crowns his mistress with a garland of flowers; the countryman,
when he stops to look at the rainbow; the city-apprentice, when he gazes
after the Lord-Mayor's show; the miser, when he hugs his gold; the
courtier, who builds his hopes upon a smile; the savage, who paints his
idol with blood; the slave, who worships a tyrant, or the tyrant, who
fancies himself a god;--the vain, the ambitious, the proud, the
choleric man, the hero and the coward, the beggar and the king, the rich
and the poor, the young and the old, all live in a world of their own
making; and the poet does no more than describe what all the others
think and act.  If his art is folly and madness, it is folly and madness
at second hand.  "There is warrant for it." Poets alone have not "such
seething brains, such shaping fantasies, that apprehend more than cooler
reason" can.

      "The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
      Are of imagination all compact.
      One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
      The madman.  While the lover, all as frantic,
      Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.
      The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,
      Doth glance from heav'n to earth, from earth to heav'n;
      And as imagination bodies forth
      The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
      Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing
      A local habitation and a name.
      Such tricks hath strong imagination."

If poetry is a dream, the business of life is much the same.  If it is
a fiction, made up of what we wish things to be, and fancy that they
are, because we wish them so, there is no other nor better reality.
Ariosto has described the loves of Angelica and Medoro: but was not
Medoro, who carved the name of his mistress on the barks of trees, as
much enamoured of her charms as he? Homer has celebrated the anger of
Achilles: but was not the hero as mad as the poet? Plato banished the
poets from his Commonwealth, lest their descriptions of the natural man
should spoil his mathematical man, who was to be without passions and
affections, who was neither to laugh nor weep, to feel sorrow nor anger,
to be cast down nor elated by any thing.  This was a chimera, however,
which never existed but in the brain of the inventor; and Homer's
poetical world has outlived Plato's philosophical Republic.

Poetry then is an imitation of nature, but the imagination and the
passions are a part of man's nature.  We shape things according to our
wishes and fancies, without poetry; but poetry is the most emphatical
language that can be found for those creations of the mind "which
ecstacy is very cunning in." Neither a mere description of natural
objects, nor a mere delineation of natural feelings, however distinct or
forcible, constitutes the ultimate end and aim of poetry, without the
heightenings of the imagination.  The light of poetry is not only a
direct but also a reflected light, that while it shews us the object,
throws a sparkling radiance on all around it: the flame of the passions,
communicated to the imagination, reveals to us, as with a flash of
lightning, the inmost recesses of thought, and penetrates our whole
being.  Poetry represents forms chiefly as they suggest other forms;
feelings, as they suggest forms or other feelings.  Poetry puts a spirit
of life and motion into the universe.  It describes the flowing, not the
fixed.  It does not define the limits of sense, or analyze the
distinctions of the understanding, but signifies the excess of the
imagination beyond the actual or ordinary impression of any object or
feeling.  The poetical impression of any object is that uneasy, exquisite
sense of beauty or power that cannot be contained within itself; that is
impatient of all limit; that (as flame bends to flame) strives to link
itself to some other image of kindred beauty or grandeur; to enshrine
itself, as it were, in the highest forms of fancy, and to relieve the
aching sense of pleasure by expressing it in the boldest manner, and by
the most striking examples of the same quality in other instances.
Poetry, according to Lord Bacon, for this reason, "has something divine
in it, because it raises the mind and hurries it into sublimity, by
conforming the shows of things to the desires of the soul, instead of
subjecting the soul to external things, as reason and history do." It is
strictly the language of the imagination; and the imagination is that
faculty which represents objects, not as they are in themselves, but as
they are moulded by other thoughts and feelings, into an infinite
variety of shapes and combinations of power.  This language is not the
less true to nature, because it is false in point of fact; but so much
the more true and natural, if it conveys the impression which the object
under the influence of passion makes on the mind.  Let an object, for
instance, be presented to the senses in a state of agitation or fear--
and the imagination will distort or magnify the object, and convert it
into the likeness of whatever is most proper to encourage the fear.  "Our
eyes are made the fools" of our other faculties.  This is the universal
law of the imagination,

      "That if it would but apprehend some joy,
      It comprehends some bringer of that joy:
      Or in the night imagining some fear,
      How easy is each bush suppos'd a bear!"

When Iachimo says of Imogen,

            "------The flame o' th' taper
      Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids
      To see the enclosed lights"--

this passionate interpretation of the motion of the flame to accord with
the speaker's own feelings, is true poetry.  The lover, equally with the
poet, speaks of the auburn tresses of his mistress as locks of shining
gold, because the least tinge of yellow in the hair has, from novelty
and a sense of personal beauty, a more lustrous effect to the
imagination than the purest gold.  We compare a man of gigantic stature
to a tower: not that he is any thing like so large, but because the
excess of his size beyond what we are accustomed to expect, or the usual
size of things of the same class, produces by contrast a greater feeling
of magnitude and ponderous strength than another object of ten times the
same dimensions.  The intensity of the feeling makes up for the
disproportion of the objects.  Things are equal to the imagination, which
have the power of affecting the mind with an equal degree of terror,
admiration, delight, or love.  When Lear calls upon the heavens to avenge
his cause, "for they are old like him," there is nothing extravagant or
impious in this sublime identification of his age with theirs; for there
is no other image which could do justice to the agonising sense of his
wrongs and his despair!

Poetry is the high-wrought enthusiasm of fancy and feeling.  As in
describing natural objects, it impregnates sensible impressions with the
forms of fancy, so it describes the feelings of pleasure or pain, by
blending them with the strongest movements of passion, and the most
striking forms of nature.  Tragic poetry, which is the most impassioned
species of it, strives to carry on the feeling to the utmost point of
sublimity or pathos, by all the force of comparison or contrast; loses
the sense of present suffering in the imaginary exaggeration of it;
exhausts the terror or pity by an unlimited indulgence of it; grapples
with impossibilities in its desperate impatience of restraint; throws us
back upon the past, forward into the future; brings every moment of our
being or object of nature in startling review before us; and in the
rapid whirl of events, lifts us from the depths of woe to the highest
contemplations on human life.  When Lear says of Edgar, "Nothing but his
unkind daughters could have brought him to this;" what a bewildered
amazement, what a wrench of the imagination, that cannot be brought to
conceive of any other cause of misery than that which has bowed it down,
and absorbs all other sorrow in its own! His sorrow, like a flood,
supplies the sources of all other sorrow.  Again, when he exclaims in the
mad scene, "The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart, see,
they bark at me!" it is passion lending occasion to imagination to make
every creature in league against him, conjuring up ingratitude and
insult in their least looked-for and most galling shapes, searching
every thread and fibre of his heart, and finding out the last remaining
image of respect or attachment in the bottom of his breast, only to
torture and kill it! In like manner, the "So I am" of Cordelia gushes
from her heart like a torrent of tears, relieving it of a weight of love
and of supposed ingratitude, which had pressed upon it for years.  What a
fine return of the passion upon itself is that in Othello--with what a
mingled agony of regret and despair he clings to the last traces of
departed happiness--when he exclaims,

                     ------"Oh now, for ever
      Farewel the tranquil mind.  Farewel content;
      Farewel the plumed troops and the big war,
      That make ambition virtue!  Oh farewel!
      Farewel the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
      The spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife,
      The royal banner, and all quality,
      Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war:
      And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
      Th' immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
      Farewel! Othello's occupation's gone!"

How his passion lashes itself up and swells and rages like a tide in
its sounding course, when in answer to the doubts expressed of his
returning love, he says,

      "Never, Iago.  Like to the Pontic sea,
      Whose icy current and compulsive course
      Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
      To the Propontic and the Hellespont:
      Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
      Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
      Till that a capable and wide revenge
      Swallow them up."--

The climax of his expostulation afterwards with Desdemona is at that
line [sic],

      "But there where I had garner'd up my heart,
      To be discarded thence!"--

One mode in which the dramatic exhibition of passion excites our
sympathy without raising our disgust is, that in proportion as it
sharpens the edge of calamity and disappointment, it strengthens the
desire of good.  It enhances our consciousness of the blessing, by making
us sensible of the magnitude of the loss.  The storm of passion lays bare
and shews us the rich depths of the human soul: the whole of our
existence, the sum total of our passions and pursuits, of that which we
desire and that which we dread, is brought before us by contrast; the
action and re-action are equal; the keenness of immediate suffering only
gives us a more intense aspiration after, and a more intimate
participation with the antagonist world of good; makes us drink deeper
of the cup of human life; tugs at the heart-strings; loosens the
pressure about them; and calls the springs of thought and feeling into
play with tenfold force.

Impassioned poetry is an emanation of the moral and intellectual part
of our nature, as well as of the sensitive--of the desire to know, the
will to act, and the power to feel; and ought to appeal to these
different parts of our constitution, in order to be perfect.  The
domestic or prose tragedy, which is thought to be the most natural, is
in this sense the least so, because it appeals almost exclusively to one
of these faculties, our sensibility.  The tragedies of Moore and Lillo,
for this reason, however affecting at the time, oppress and lie like a
dead weight upon the mind, a load of misery which it is unable to throw
off: the tragedy of Shakspeare, which is true poetry, stirs our inmost
affections; abstracts evil from itself by combining it with all the
forms of imagination, and with the deepest workings of the heart, and
rouses the whole man within us.

The pleasure, however, derived from tragic poetry, is not any thing
peculiar to it as poetry, as a fictitious and fanciful thing.  It is not
an anomaly of the imagination.  It has its source and ground-work in the
common love of strong excitement.  As Mr. Burke observes, people flock to
see a tragedy; but if there were a public execution in the next street,
the theatre would very soon be empty.  It is not then the difference
between fiction and reality that solves the difficulty.  Children are
satisfied with the stories of ghosts and witches in plain prose: nor do
the hawkers of full, true, and particular accounts of murders and
executions about the streets, find it necessary to have them turned into
penny ballads, before they can dispose of these interesting and
authentic documents.  The grave politician drives a thriving trade of
abuse and calumnies poured out against those whom he makes his enemies
for no other end than that he may live by them.  The popular preacher
makes less frequent mention of heaven than of hell.  Oaths and nicknames
are only a more vulgar sort of poetry or rhetoric.  We are as fond of
indulging our violent passions as of reading a description of those of
others.  We are as prone to make a torment of our fears, as to luxuriate
in our hopes of good.  If it be asked, Why we do so? the best answer will
be, Because we cannot help it.  The sense of power is as strong a
principle in the mind as the love of pleasure.  Objects of terror and
pity exercise the same despotic control over it as those of love or
beauty.  It is as natural to hate as to love, to despise as to admire, to
express our hatred or contempt, as our love or admiration.

      "Masterless passion sways us to the mood
      Of what it likes or loathes."

Not that we like what we loathe; but we like to indulge our hatred
and scorn of it; to dwell upon it, to exasperate our idea of it by every
refinement of ingenuity and extravagance of illustration; to make it a
bugbear to ourselves, to point it out to others in all the splendour of
deformity, to embody it to the senses, to stigmatise it by name, to
grapple with it in thought, in action, to sharpen our intellect, to arm
our will against it, to know the worst we have to contend with, and to
contend with it to the utmost.  Poetry is only the highest eloquence of
passion, the most vivid form of expression that can be given to our
conception of any thing, whether pleasurable or painful, mean or
dignified, delightful or distressing.  It is the perfect coincidence of
the image and the words with the feeling we have, and of which we cannot
get rid in any other way, that gives an instant "satisfaction to the
thought." This is equally the origin of wit and fancy, of comedy and
tragedy, of the sublime and pathetic.  When Pope says of the Lord Mayor's
shew,--

      "Now night descending, the proud scene is o'er,
      But lives in Settle's numbers one day more!"

--when Collins makes Danger, "with limbs of giant mould,"

           ------"Throw him on the steep
      Of some loose hanging rock asleep:"

when Lear calls out in extreme anguish,

      "Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
      How much more hideous shew'st in a child
      Than the sea-monster!"

--the passion of contempt in the one case, of terror in the other, and
of indignation in the last, is perfectly satisfied.  We see the thing
ourselves, and shew it to others as we feel it to exist, and as, in
spite of ourselves, we are compelled to think of it.  The imagination, by
thus embodying and turning them to shape, gives an obvious relief to the
indistinct and importunate cravings of the will.--We do not wish the
thing to be so; but we wish it to appear such as it is.  For knowledge is
conscious power; and the mind is no longer, in this case, the dupe,
though it may be the victim of vice or folly.

Poetry is in all its shapes the language of the imagination and the
passions, of fancy and will.  Nothing, therefore, can be more absurd than
the outcry which has been sometimes raised by frigid and pedantic
critics, for reducing the language of poetry to the standard of common
sense and reason: for the end and use of poetry, "both at the first and
now, was and is to hold the mirror up to nature," seen through the
medium of passion and imagination, not divested of that medium by means
of literal truth or abstract reason.  The painter of history might as
well be required to represent the face of a person who has just trod
upon a serpent with the still-life expression of a common portrait, as
the poet to describe the most striking and vivid impressions which
things can be supposed to make upon the mind, in the language of common
conversation.  Let who will strip nature of the colours and the shapes of
fancy, the poet is not bound to do so; the impressions of common sense
and strong imagination, that is, of passion and indifference, cannot be
the same, and they must have a separate language to do justice to
either.  Objects must strike differently upon the mind, independently of
what they are in themselves, as long as we have a different interest in
them, as we see them in a different point of view, nearer or at a
greater distance (morally or physically speaking) from novelty, from old
acquaintance, from our ignorance of them, from our fear of their
consequences, from contrast, from unexpected likeness.  We can no more
take away the faculty of the imagination, than we can see all objects
without light or shade.  Some things must dazzle us by their
preternatural light; others must hold us in suspense, and tempt our
curiosity to explore their obscurity.  Those who would dispel these
various illusions, to give us their drab-coloured creation in their
stead, are not very wise.  Let the naturalist, if he will, catch the
glow-worm, carry it home with him in a box, and find it next morning
nothing but a little grey worm; let the poet or the lover of poetry
visit it at evening, when beneath the scented hawthorn and the crescent
moon it has built itself a palace of emerald light.  This is also one
part of nature, one appearance which the glow-worm presents, and that
not the least interesting; so poetry is one part of the history of the
human mind, though it is neither science nor philosophy.  It cannot be
concealed, however, that the progress of knowledge and refinement has a
tendency to circumscribe the limits of the imagination, and to clip the
wings of poetry.  The province of the imagination is principally
visionary, the unknown and undefined: the understanding restores things
to their natural boundaries, and strips them of their fanciful
pretensions.  Hence the history of religious and poetical enthusiasm is
much the same; and both have received a sensible shock from the progress
of experimental philosophy.  It is the undefined and uncommon that gives
birth and scope to the imagination; we can only fancy what we do not
know.  As in looking into the mazes of a tangled wood we fill them with
what shapes we please, with ravenous beasts, with caverns vast, and
drear enchantments, so in our ignorance of the world about us, we make
gods or devils of the first object we see, and set no bounds to the
wilful suggestions of our hopes and fears.

      "And visions, as poetic eyes avow,
      Hang on each leaf and cling to every bough."

There can never be another Jacob's dream.  Since that time, the heavens
have gone farther off, and grown astronomical.  They have become averse
to the imagination, nor will they return to us on the squares of the
distances, or on Doctor Chalmers's Discourses.  Rembrandt's picture
brings the matter nearer to us.--It is not only the progress of
mechanical knowledge, but the necessary advances of civilization that
are unfavourable to the spirit of poetry.  We not only stand in less awe
of the preternatural world, but we can calculate more surely, and look
with more indifference, upon the regular routine of this.  The heroes of
the fabulous ages rid the world of monsters and giants.  At present we
are less exposed to the vicissitudes of good or evil, to the incursions
of wild beasts or "bandit fierce," or to the unmitigated fury of the
elements.  The time has been that "our fell of hair would at a dismal
treatise rouse and stir as life were in it." But the police spoils all;
and we now hardly so much as dream of a midnight murder.  Macbeth is only
tolerated in this country for the sake of the music; and in the United
States of America, where the philosophical principles of government are
carried still farther in theory and practice, we find that the Beggar's
Opera is hooted from the stage.  Society, by degrees, is constructed into
a machine that carries us safely and insipidly from one end of life to
the other, in a very comfortable prose style.

      "Obscurity her curtain round them drew,
      And siren Sloth a dull quietus sung."

The remarks which have been here made, would, in some measure, lead to a
solution of the question of the comparative merits of painting and
poetry.  I do not mean to give any preference, but it should seem that
the argument which has been sometimes set up, that painting must affect
the imagination more strongly, because it represents the image more
distinctly, is not well founded.  We may assume without much temerity,
that poetry is more poetical than painting.  When artists or connoisseurs
talk on stilts about the poetry of painting, they shew that they know
little about poetry, and have little love for the art.  Painting gives
the object itself; poetry what it implies.  Painting embodies what a
thing contains in itself: poetry suggests what exists out of it, in any
manner connected with it.  But this last is the proper province of the
imagination.  Again, as it relates to passion, painting gives the event,
poetry the progress of events: but it is during the progress, in the
interval of expectation and suspense, while our hopes and fears are
strained to the highest pitch of breathless agony, that the pinch of the
interest lies.

      "Between the acting of a dreadful thing
      And the first motion, all the interim is
      Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
      The mortal instruments are then in council;
      And the state of man, like to a little kingdom,
      Suffers then the nature of an insurrection."

But by the time that the picture is painted, all is over.  Faces are
the best part of a picture; but even faces are not what we chiefly
remember in what interests us most.--But it may be asked then, Is there
anything better than Claude Lorraine's landscapes, than Titian's
portraits, than Raphael's cartoons, or the Greek statues? Of the two
first I shall say nothing, as they are evidently picturesque, rather
than imaginative.  Raphael's cartoons are certainly the finest comments
that ever were made on the Scriptures.  Would their effect be the same if
we were not acquainted with the text? But the New Testament existed
before the cartoons.  There is one subject of which there is no cartoon,
Christ washing the feet of the disciples the night before his death.  But
that chapter does not need a commentary! It is for want of some such
resting place for the imagination that the Greek statues are little else
than specious forms.  They are marble to the touch and to the heart.  They
have not an informing principle within them.  In their faultless
excellence they appear sufficient to themselves.  By their beauty they
are raised above the frailties of passion or suffering.  By their beauty
they are deified.  But they are not objects of religious faith to us, and
their forms are a reproach to common humanity.  They seem to have no
sympathy with us, and not to want our admiration.

Poetry in its matter and form is natural imagery or feeling, combined
with passion and fancy.  In its mode of conveyance, it combines the
ordinary use of language with musical expression.  There is a question of
long standing, in what the essence of poetry consists; or what it is
that determines why one set of ideas should be expressed in prose,
another in verse.  Milton has told us his idea of poetry in a single
line--

       "Thoughts that voluntary move
      Harmonious numbers."

As there are certain sounds that excite certain movements, and the
song and dance go together, so there are, no doubt, certain thoughts
that lead to certain tones of voice, or modulations of sound, and change
"the words of Mercury into the songs of Apollo." There is a striking
instance of this adaptation of the movement of sound and rhythm to the
subject, in Spenser's description of the Satyrs accompanying Una to the
cave of Sylvanus.

      "So from the ground she fearless doth arise
         And walketh forth without suspect of crime.
      They, all as glad as birds of joyous prime,
         Thence lead her forth, about her dancing round,
      Shouting and singing all a shepherd's rhyme;
         And with green branches strewing all the ground,
      Do worship her as queen with olive garland crown'd.

      And all the way their merry pipes they sound,
       That all the woods and doubled echoes ring;
      And with their horned feet do wear the ground,
       Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant spring;
      So towards old Sylvanus they her bring,
         Who with the noise awaked, cometh out."
                                   _Faery Queen_, b. i. c. vi.

On the contrary, there is nothing either musical or natural in the
ordinary construction of language.  It is a thing altogether arbitrary
and conventional.  Neither in the sounds themselves, which are the
voluntary signs of certain ideas, nor in their grammatical arrangements
in common speech, is there any principle of natural imitation, or
correspondence to the individual ideas, or to the tone of feeling with
which they are conveyed to others.  The jerks, the breaks, the
inequalities, and harshnesses of prose, are fatal to the flow of a
poetical imagination, as a jolting road or a stumbling horse disturbs
the reverie of an absent man.  But poetry makes these odds all even.  It
is the music of language, answering to the music of the mind, untying as
it were "the secret soul of harmony." Wherever any object takes such a
hold of the mind as to make us dwell upon it, and brood over it, melting
the heart in tenderness, or kindling it to a sentiment of enthusiasm;--
wherever a movement of imagination or passion is impressed on the mind,
by which it seeks to prolong and repeat the emotion, to bring all other
objects into accord with it, and to give the same movement of harmony,
sustained and continuous, or gradually varied according to the occasion,
to the sounds that express it--this is poetry.  The musical in sound is
the sustained and continuous; the musical in thought is the sustained
and continuous also.  There is a near connection between music and
deep-rooted passion.  Mad people sing.  As often as articulation passes
naturally into intonation, there poetry begins.  Where one idea gives a
tone and colour to others, where one feeling melts others into it, there
can be no reason why the same principle should not be extended to the
sounds by which the voice utters these emotions of the soul, and blends
syllables and lines into each other.  It is to supply the inherent defect
of harmony in the customary mechanism of language, to make the sound an
echo to the sense, when the sense becomes a sort of echo to itself--to
mingle the tide of verse, "the golden cadences of poetry," with the tide
of feeling, flowing and murmuring as it flows--in short, to take the
language of the imagination from off the ground, and enable it to spread
its wings where it may indulge its own impulses--

      "Sailing with supreme dominion
      Through the azure deep of air--"

without being stopped, or fretted, or diverted with the abruptnesses and
petty obstacles, and discordant flats and sharps of prose, that poetry
was invented.  It is to common language, what springs are to a carriage,
or wings to feet.  In ordinary speech we arrive at a certain harmony by
the modulations of the voice: in poetry the same thing is done
systematically by a regular collocation of syllables.  It has been well
observed, that every one who declaims warmly, or grows intent upon a
subject, rises into a sort of blank verse or measured prose.  The
merchant, as described in Chaucer, went on his way "sounding always the
increase of his winning." Every prose-writer has more or less of
rhythmical adaptation, except poets, who, when deprived of the regular
mechanism of verse, seem to have no principle of modulation left in
their writings.

An excuse might be made for rhyme in the same manner.  It is but fair
that the ear should linger on the sounds that delight it, or avail
itself of the same brilliant coincidence and unexpected recurrence of
syllables, that have been displayed in the invention and collocation of
images.  It is allowed that rhyme assists the memory; and a man of wit
and shrewdness has been heard to say, that the only four good lines of
poetry are the well known ones which tell the number of days in the
months of the year.

      "Thirty days hath September," &c.

But if the jingle of names assists the memory, may it not also quicken
the fancy? and there are other things worth having at our fingers' ends,
besides the contents of the almanac.--Pope's versification is tiresome,
from its excessive sweetness and uniformity.  Shakspeare's blank verse is
the perfection of dramatic dialogue.

All is not poetry that passes for such: nor does verse make the whole
difference between poetry and prose.  The Iliad does not cease to be
poetry in a literal translation; and Addison's Campaign has been very
properly denominated a Gazette in rhyme.  Common prose differs from
poetry, as treating for the most part either of such trite, familiar,
and irksome matters of fact, as convey no extraordinary impulse to the
imagination, or else of such difficult and laborious processes of the
understanding, as do not admit of the wayward or violent movements
either of the imagination or the passions.

I will mention three works which come as near to poetry as possible
without absolutely being so, namely, the Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson
Crusoe, and the Tales of Boccaccio.  Chaucer and Dryden have translated
some of the last into English rhyme, but the essence and the power of
poetry was there before.  That which lifts the spirit above the earth,
which draws the soul out of itself with indescribable longings, is
poetry in kind, and generally fit to become so in name, by being
"married to immortal verse." If it is of the essence of poetry to strike
and fix the imagination, whether we will or no, to make the eye of
childhood glisten with the starting tear, to be never thought of
afterwards with indifference, John Bunyan and Daniel Defoe may be
permitted to pass for poets in their way.  The mixture of fancy and
reality in the Pilgrim's Progress was never equalled in any allegory.
His pilgrims walk above the earth, and yet are on it.  What zeal, what
beauty, what truth of fiction! What deep feeling in the description of
Christian's swimming across the water at last, and in the picture of the
Shining Ones within the gates, with wings at their backs and garlands on
their heads, who are to wipe all tears from his eyes! The writer's
genius, though not "dipped in dews of Castalie," was baptised with the
Holy Spirit and with fire.  The prints in this book are no small part of
it.  If the confinement of Philoctetes in the island of Lemnos was a
subject for the most beautiful of all the Greek tragedies, what shall we
say to Robinson Crusoe in his? Take the speech of the Greek hero on
leaving his cave, beautiful as it is, and compare it with the
reflections of the English adventurer in his solitary place of
confinement.  The thoughts of home, and of all from which he is for ever
cut off, swell and press against his bosom, as the heaving ocean rolls
its ceaseless tide against the rocky shore, and the very beatings of his
heart become audible in the eternal silence that surrounds him.  Thus he
says,

      "As I walked about, either in my hunting, or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me
on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner,
locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption.  In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.  Sometimes it would take
me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh,
and look upon the ground for an hour or two together, and this was still
worse to me, for if I could burst into tears or vent myself in words, it
would go off, and the grief having exhausted itself would abate."  P.
50.

The story of his adventures would not make a poem like the Odyssey,
it is true; but the relator had the true genius of a poet.  It has been
made a question whether Richardson's romances are poetry; and the answer
perhaps is, that they are not poetry, because they are not romance.  The
interest is worked up to an inconceivable height; but it is by an
infinite number of little things, by incessant labour and calls upon the
attention, by a repetition of blows that have no rebound in them.  The
sympathy excited is not a voluntary contribution, but a tax.  Nothing is
unforced and spontaneous.  There is a want of elasticity and motion.  The
story does not "give an echo to the seat where love is throned." The
heart does not answer of itself like a chord in music.  The fancy does
not run on before the writer with breathless expectation, but is dragged
along with an infinite number of pins and wheels, like those with which
the Lilliputians dragged Gulliver pinioned to the royal palace.--Sir
Charles Grandison is a coxcomb.  What sort of a figure would he cut,
translated into an epic poem, by the side of Achilles? Clarissa, the
divine Clarissa, is too interesting by half.  She is interesting in her
ruffles, in her gloves, her samplers, her aunts and uncles--she is
interesting in all that is uninteresting.  Such things, however intensely
they may be brought home to us, are not conductors to the imagination.
There is infinite truth and feeling in Richardson; but it is extracted
from a _caput mortuum_ of circumstances: it does not evaporate of
itself.  His poetical genius is like Ariel confined in a pine-tree, and
requires an artificial process to let it out.  Shakspeare says--

              "Our poesy is as a gum
      Which issues whence 'tis nourished, our gentle flame
      Provokes itself, and like the current flies
      Each bound it chafes." [1]

I shall conclude this general account with some remarks on four of
the principal works of poetry in the world, at different periods of
history--Homer, the Bible, Dante, and let me add, Ossian.  In Homer,
the principle of action or life is predominant; in the Bible, the
principle of faith and the idea of Providence; Dante is a
personification of blind will; and in Ossian we see the decay of life,
and the lag end of the world.  Homer's poetry is the heroic: it is full
of life and action: it is bright as the day, strong as a river.  In the
vigour of his intellect, he grapples with all the objects of nature, and
enters into all the relations of social life.

[1] Burke's writings are not poetry, notwithstanding the vividness of
the fancy, because the subject matter is abstruse and dry, not natural,
but artificial.  The difference between poetry and eloquence is, that the
one is the eloquence of the imagination, and the other of the
understanding.  Eloquence tries to persuade the will, and convince the
reason: poetry produces its effect by instantaneous sympathy.  Nothing is
a subject for poetry that admits of a dispute.  Poets are in general bad
prose-writers, because their images, though fine in themselves, are not
to the purpose, and do not carry on the argument.  The French poetry
wants the forms of the imagination.  It is didactic more than dramatic.
And some of our own poetry which has been most admired, is only poetry
in the rhyme, and in the studied use of poetic diction.

He saw many countries, and the manners of many men; and he has brought
them all together in his poem.  He describes his heroes going to battle
with a prodigality of life, arising from an exuberance of animal
spirits: we see them before us, their number, and their order of battle,
poured out upon the plain "all plumed like estriches, like eagles newly
bathed, wanton as goats, wild as young bulls, youthful as May, and
gorgeous as the sun at midsummer," covered with glittering armour, with
dust and blood; while the Gods quaff their nectar in golden cups, or
mingle in the fray; and the old men assembled on the walls of Troy rise
up with reverence as Helen passes by them.  The multitude of things in
Homer is wonderful; their splendour, their truth, their force, and
variety.  His poetry is, like his religion, the poetry of number and
form: he describes the bodies as well as the souls of men.

The poetry of the Bible is that of imagination and of faith: it is
abstract and disembodied: it is not the poetry of form, but of power;
not of multitude, but of immensity.  It does not divide into many, but
aggrandizes into one.  Its ideas of nature are like its ideas of God.  It
is not the poetry of social life, but of solitude: each man seems alone
in the world, with the original forms of nature, the rocks, the earth,
and the sky.  It is not the poetry of action or heroic enterprise, but of
faith in a supreme Providence, and resignation to the power that governs
the universe.  As the idea of God was removed farther from humanity, and
a scattered polytheism, it became more profound and intense, as it
became more universal, for the Infinite is present to every thing: "If
we fly into the uttermost parts of the earth, it is there also; if we
turn to the east or the west, we cannot escape from it." Man is thus
aggrandised in the image of his Maker.  The history of the patriarchs is
of this kind; they are founders of a chosen race of people, the
inheritors of the earth; they exist in the generations which are to come
after them.  Their poetry, like their religious creed, is vast, unformed,
obscure, and infinite; a vision is upon it--an invisible hand is
suspended over it.  The spirit of the Christian religion consists in the
glory hereafter to be revealed; but in the Hebrew dispensation,
Providence took an immediate share in the affairs of this life.  Jacob's
dream arose out of this intimate communion between heaven and earth: it
was this that let down, in the sight of the youthful patriarch, a golden
ladder from the sky to the earth, with angels ascending and descending
upon it, and shed a light upon the lonely place, which can never pass
away.  The story of Ruth, again, is as if all the depth of natural
affection in the human race was involved in her breast.  There are
descriptions in the book of Job more prodigal of imagery, more intense
in passion, than any thing in Homer, as that of the state of his
prosperity, and of the vision that came upon him by night.  The metaphors
in the Old Testament are more boldly figurative.  Things were collected
more into masses, and gave a greater _momentum_ to the imagination.

Dante was the father of modern poetry, and he may therefore claim a
place in this connection.  His poem is the first great step from Gothic
darkness and barbarism; and the struggle of thought in it to burst the
thraldom in which the human mind had been so long held, is felt in every
page.  He stood bewildered, not appalled, on that dark shore which
separates the ancient and the modern world; and saw the glories of
antiquity dawning through the abyss of time, while revelation opened its
passage to the other world.  He was lost in wonder at what had been done
before him, and he dared to emulate it.  Dante seems to have been
indebted to the Bible for the gloomy tone of his mind, as well as for
the prophetic fury which exalts and kindles his poetry; but he is
utterly unlike Homer.  His genius is not a sparkling flame, but the
sullen heat of a furnace.  He is power, passion, self-will personified.
In all that relates to the descriptive or fanciful part of poetry, he
bears no comparison to many who had gone before, or who have come after
him; but there is a gloomy abstraction in his conceptions, which lies
like a dead weight upon the mind; a benumbing stupor, a breathless awe,
from the intensity of the impression; a terrible obscurity, like that
which oppresses us in dreams; an identity of interest, which moulds
every object to its own purposes, and clothes all things with the
passions and imaginations of the human soul,--that make amends for all
other deficiencies.  The immediate objects he presents to the mind are
not much in themselves, they want grandeur, beauty, and order; but they
become every thing by the force of the character he impresses upon them.
His mind lends its own power to the objects which it contemplates,
instead of borrowing it from them.  He takes advantage even of the
nakedness and dreary vacuity of his subject.  His imagination peoples the
shades of death, and broods over the silent air.  He is the severest of
all writers, the most hard and impenetrable, the most opposite to the
flowery and glittering; who relies most on his own power, and the sense
of it in others, and who leaves most room to the imagination of his
readers.  Dante's only endeavour is to interest; and he interests by
exciting our sympathy with the emotion by which he is himself possessed.
He does not place before us the objects by which that emotion has been
created; but he seizes on the attention, by shewing us the effect they
produce on his feelings; and his poetry accordingly gives the same
thrilling and overwhelming sensation, which is caught by gazing on the
face of a person who has seen some object of horror.  The improbability
of the events, the abruptness and monotony in the Inferno, are
excessive: but the interest never flags, from the continued earnestness
of the author's mind.  Dante's great power is in combining internal
feelings with external objects.  Thus the gate of hell, on which that
withering inscription is written, seems to be endowed with speech and
consciousness, and to utter its dread warning, not without a sense of
mortal woes.  This author habitually unites the absolutely local and
individual with the greatest wildness and mysticism.  In the midst of the
obscure and shadowy regions of the lower world, a tomb suddenly rises up
with the inscription, "I am the tomb of Pope Anastasius the Sixth": and
half the personages whom he has crowded into the Inferno are his own
acquaintance.  All this, perhaps, tends to heighten the effect by the
bold intermixture of realities, and by an appeal, as it were, to the
individual knowledge and experience of the reader.  He affords few
subjects for picture.  There is, indeed, one gigantic one, that of Count
Ugolino, of which Michael Angelo made a bas-relief, and which Sir Joshua
Reynolds ought not to have painted.

Another writer whom I shall mention last, and whom I cannot persuade
myself to think a mere modern in the groundwork, is Ossian.  He is a
feeling and a name that can never be destroyed in the minds of his
readers.  As Homer is the first vigour and lustihed, Ossian is the decay
and old age of poetry.  He lives only in the recollection and regret of
the past.  There is one impression which he conveys more entirely than
all other poets, namely, the sense of privation, the loss of all things,
of friends, of good name, of country--he is even without God in the
world.  He converses only with the spirits of the departed; with the
motionless and silent clouds.  The cold moonlight sheds its faint lustre
on his head; the fox peeps out of the ruined tower; the thistle waves
its beard to the wandering gale; and the strings of his harp seem, as
the hand of age, as the tale of other times, passes over them, to sigh
and rustle like the dry reeds in the winter's wind! The feeling of
cheerless desolation, of the loss of the pith and sap of existence, of
the annihilation of the substance, and the clinging to the shadow of all
things as in a mock-embrace, is here perfect.  In this way, the
lamentation of Selma for the loss of Salgar is the finest of all.  If it
were indeed possible to shew that this writer was nothing, it would only
be another instance of mutability, another blank made, another void left
in the heart, another confirmation of that feeling which makes him so
often complain, "Roll on, ye dark brown years, ye bring no joy on your
wing to Ossian!"




LECTURE II.
ON CHAUCER AND SPENSER.


Having, in the former Lecture, given some account of the nature of
poetry in general, I shall proceed, in the next place, to a more
particular consideration of the genius and history of English poetry.  I
shall take, as the subject of the present lecture, Chaucer and Spenser,
two out of four of the greatest names in poetry, which this country has
to boast.  Both of them, however, were much indebted to the early poets
of Italy, and may be considered as belonging, in a certain degree, to
the same school.  The freedom and copiousness with which our most
original writers, in former periods, availed themselves of the
productions of their predecessors, frequently transcribing whole
passages, without scruple or acknowledgment, may appear contrary to the
etiquette of modern literature, when the whole stock of poetical
common-places has become public property, and no one is compelled to
trade upon any particular author.  But it is not so much a subject of
wonder, at a time when to read and write was of itself an honorary
distinction, when learning was almost as great a rarity as genius, and
when in fact those who first transplanted the beauties of other
languages into their own, might be considered as public benefactors, and
the founders of a national literature.--There are poets older than
Chaucer, and in the interval between him and Spenser; but their genius
was not such as to place them in any point of comparison with either of
these celebrated men; and an inquiry into their particular merits or
defects might seem rather to belong to the province of the antiquary,
than be thought generally interesting to the lovers of poetry in the
present day.

Chaucer (who has been very properly considered as the father of
English poetry) preceded Spenser by two centuries.  He is supposed to
have been born in London, in the year 1328, during the reign of Edward
III.  and to have died in 1400, at the age of seventy-two.  He received a
learned education at one, or at both of the universities, and travelled
early into Italy, where he became thoroughly imbued with the spirit and
excellences of the great Italian poets and prose-writers, Dante,
Petrarch, and Boccace; and is said to have had a personal interview with
one of these, Petrarch.  He was connected, by marriage, with the famous
John of Gaunt, through whose interest he was introduced into several
public employments.  Chaucer was an active partisan, a religious
reformer, and from the share he took in some disturbances, on one
occasion, he was obliged to fly the country.  On his return, he was
imprisoned, and made his peace with government, as it is said, by a
discovery of his associates.  Fortitude does not appear, at any time, to
have been the distinguishing virtue of poets.--There is, however, an
obvious similarity between the practical turn of Chaucer's mind and
restless impatience of his character, and the tone of his writings.  Yet
it would be too much to attribute the one to the other as cause and
effect: for Spenser, whose poetical temperament was an effeminate as
Chaucer's was stern and masculine, was equally engaged in public
affairs, and had mixed equally in the great world.  So much does native
disposition predominate over accidental circumstances, moulding them to
its previous bent and purposes! For while Chaucer's intercourse with the
busy world, and collision with the actual passions and conflicting
interests of others, seemed to brace the sinews of his understanding,
and gave to his writings the air of a man who describes persons and
things that he had known and been intimately concerned in; the same
opportunities, operating on a differently constituted frame, only served
to alienate Spenser's mind the more from the "close-pent up" scenes of
ordinary life, and to make him "rive their concealing continents," to
give himself up to the unrestrained indulgence of "flowery tenderness."

It is not possible for any two writers to be more opposite in this
respect.  Spenser delighted in luxurious enjoyment; Chaucer, in severe
activity of mind.  As Spenser was the most romantic and visionary,
Chaucer was the most practical of all the great poets, the most a man of
business and the world.  His poetry reads like history.  Every thing has a
downright reality; at least in the relator's mind.  A simile, or a
sentiment, is as if it were given in upon evidence.  Thus he describes
Cressid's first avowal of her love.

      "And as the new abashed nightingale,
      That stinteth first when she beginneth sing,
      When that she heareth any herde's tale,
      Or in the hedges any wight stirring,
      And after, sicker, doth her voice outring;
      Right so Cresseide, when that her dread stent,
      Open'd her heart, and told him her intent."

This is so true and natural, and beautifully simple, that the two things
seem identified with each other.  Again, it is said in the Knight's
Tale--

      "Thus passeth yere by yere, and day by day,
      Till it felle ones in a morwe of May,
      That Emelie that fayrer was to sene
      Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene;
      And fresher than the May with floures newe,
      For with the rose-colour strof hire hewe:
      I n'ot which was the finer of hem two."

This scrupulousness about the literal preference, as if some question of
matter of fact was at issue, is remarkable.  I might mention that other,
where he compares the meeting between Palamon and Arcite to a hunter
waiting for a lion in a gap;--

      "That stondeth at a gap with a spere,
      Whan hunted is the lion or the bere,
      And hereth him come rushing in the greves,
      And breking both the boughes and the leves:"--

or that still finer one of Constance, when she is condemned to death:--

      "Have ye not seen somtime a pale face
      (Among a prees) of him that hath been lad
      Toward his deth, wheras he geteth no grace,
      And swiche a colour in his face hath had,
      Men mighten know him that was so bestad,
      Amonges all the faces in that route;
      So stant Custance, and loketh hire aboute."

The beauty, the pathos here does not seem to be of the poet's seeking,
but a part of the necessary texture of the fable.  He speaks of what he
wishes to describe with the accuracy, the discrimination of one who
relates what has happened to himself, or has had the best information
from those who have been eye-witnesses of it.  The strokes of his pencil
always tell.  He dwells only on the essential, on that which would be
interesting to the persons really concerned: yet as he never omits any
material circumstance, he is prolix from the number of points on which
he touches, without being diffuse on any one; and is sometimes tedious
from the fidelity with which he adheres to his subject, as other writers
are from the frequency of their digressions from it.  The chain of his
story is composed of a number of fine links, closely connected together,
and rivetted by a single blow.  There is an instance of the minuteness
which he introduces into his most serious descriptions in his account of
Palamon when left alone in his cell:

      "Swiche sorrow he maketh that the grete tour
      Resouned of his yelling and clamour:
      The pure fetters on his shinnes grete
      Were of his bitter salte teres wete."

The mention of this last circumstance looks like a part of the
instructions he had to follow, which he had no discretionary power to
leave out or introduce at pleasure.  He is contented to find grace and
beauty in truth.  He exhibits for the most part the naked object, with
little drapery thrown over it.  His metaphors, which are few, are not for
ornament, but use, and as like as possible to the things themselves.  He
does not affect to shew his power over the reader's mind, but the power
which his subject has over his own.  The readers of Chaucer's poetry feel
more nearly what the persons he describes must have felt, than perhaps
those of any other poet.  His sentiments are not voluntary effusions of
the poet's fancy, but founded on the natural impulses and habitual
prejudices of the characters he has to represent.  There is an inveteracy
of purpose, a sincerity of feeling, which never relaxes or grows vapid,
in whatever they do or say.  There is no artificial, pompous display, but
a strict parsimony of the poet's materials, like the rude simplicity of
the age in which he lived.  His poetry resembles the root just springing
from the ground, rather than the full-blown flower.  His muse is no
"babbling gossip of the air," fluent and redundant; but, like a
stammerer, or a dumb person, that has just found the use of speech,
crowds many things together with eager haste, with anxious pauses, and
fond repetitions to prevent mistake.  His words point as an index to the
objects, like the eye or finger.  There were none of the common-places of
poetic diction in our author's time, no reflected lights of fancy, no
borrowed roseate tints; he was obliged to inspect things for himself, to
look narrowly, and almost to handle the object, as in the obscurity of
morning we partly see and partly grope our way; so that his descriptions
have a sort of tangible character belonging to them, and produce the
effect of sculpture on the mind.  Chaucer had an equal eye for truth of
nature and discrimination of character; and his interest in what he saw
gave new distinctness and force to his power of observation.  The
picturesque and the dramatic are in him closely blended together, and
hardly distinguishable; for he principally describes external
appearances as indicating character, as symbols of internal sentiment.
There is a meaning in what he sees; and it is this which catches his eye
by sympathy.  Thus the costume and dress of the Canterbury Pilgrims--of
the Knight--the Squire--the Oxford Scholar--the Gap-toothed Wife
of Bath, and the rest, speak for themselves.  To take one or two of these
at random:

      "There was also a nonne, a Prioresse,
      That of hire smiling was ful simple and coy;
      Hire gretest othe n'as but by seint Eloy:
      And she was cleped Madame Eglentine.
      Ful wel she sange the service divine
      Entuned in hire nose ful swetely;
      And Frenche she spake ful fayre and fetisly,
      After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,
      For Frenche of Paris was to hire unknowe.
      At mete was she wel ytaughte withalle;
      She lette no morsel from hire lippes falle,
      Ne wette hire fingres in hire sauce depe.

      *   *   *   *   *   *

      And sikerly she was of great disport,
      And ful plesant, and amiable of port,
      And peined hire to contrefeten chere
      Of court, and ben estatelich of manere,
      And to ben holden digne of reverence.
        But for to speken of hire conscience,
      She was so charitable and so pitous,
      She wolde wepe if that she saw a mous
      Caughte in a trappe, if it were ded or bledde.
      Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde
      With rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel brede.
      But sore wept she if on of hem were dede,
      Or if men smote it with a yerde smert:
      And all was conscience and tendre herte.
        Ful semely hire wimple ypinched was;
      Hire nose tretis; hire eyen grey as glas;
      Hire mouth ful smale; and therto soft and red;
      But sickerly she hadde a fayre forehed.
      It was almost a spanne brode, I trowe."

      "A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,
      An out-rider, that loved venerie:
      A manly man, to ben an abbot able.
      Ful many a deinte hors hadde he in stable:
      And whan he rode, men mighte his bridel here,
      Gingeling in a whistling wind as clere,
      And eke as loude, as doth the chapell belle,
      Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
        The reule of Seint Maure and of Seint Beneit,
      Because that it was olde and somdele streit,
      This ilke monk lette olde thinges pace,
      And held after the newe world the trace. [*]
      He yave not of the text a pulled hen,
      That saith, that hunters ben not holy men;--
      Therfore he was a prickasoure a right:
      Greihoundes he hadde as swift as foul of flight:
      Of pricking and of hunting for the hare
      Was all his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
        I saw his sleves purfiled at the hond
      With gris, and that the finest of the lond.
      And for to fasten his hood under his chinne,
      He had of gold ywrought a curious pinne:
      A love-knotte in the greter end ther was.
      His hed was balled, and shone as any glas,
      And eke his face, as it hadde ben anoint.
      He was a lord ful fat and in good point.
      His eyen stepe, and rolling in his hed,
      That stemed as a forneis of a led.
      His botes souple, his hors in gret estat,
      Now certainly he was a fayre prelat.
      He was not pale as a forpined gost.
      A fat swan loved he best of any rost.
      His palfrey was as broune as is a bery."

The Serjeant at Law is the same identical individual as Lawyer
Dowling in Tom Jones, who wished to divide himself into a hundred
pieces, to be in a hundred places at once.

      "No wher so besy a man as he ther n'as,
      And yet he semed besier than he was."

The Frankelein, in "whose hous it snewed of mete and drinke"; the
Shipman, "who rode upon a rouncie, as he couthe"; the Doctour of
Phisike, "whose studie was but litel of the Bible"; the Wif of Bath, in

      "All whose parish ther was non,
      That to the offring before hire shulde gon,
      And if ther did, certain so wroth was she,
      That she was out of alle charitee;"

--the poure Persone of a toun, "whose parish was wide, and houses fer
asonder"; the Miller, and the Reve, "a slendre colerike man," are all of
the same stamp.  They are every one samples of a kind; abstract
definitions of a species.  Chaucer, it has been said, numbered the
classes of men, as Linnaeus numbered the plants.  Most of them remain to
this day: others that are obsolete, and may well be dispensed with,
still live in his descriptions of them.  Such is the Sompnoure:

      "A Sompnoure was ther with us in that place,
      That hadde a fire-red cherubinnes face,
      For sausefleme he was, with eyen narwe,
      As hote he was, and likerous as a sparwe,
      With scalled browes blake, and pilled berd:
      Of his visage children were sore aferd.
      Ther n'as quicksilver, litarge, ne brimston,
      Boras, ceruse, ne oile of tartre non,
      Ne oinement that wolde clense or bite,
      That him might helpen of his whelkes white,
      Ne of the knobbes sitting on his chekes.
      Wel loved he garlike, onions, and lekes,
      And for to drinke strong win as rede as blood.
      Than wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood.
      And whan that he wel dronken had the win,
      Than wold he speken no word but Latin.
      A fewe termes coude he, two or three,
      That he had lerned out of som decree;
      No wonder is, he heard it all the day.--
        In danger hadde he at his owen gise
      The yonge girles of the diocise,
      And knew hir conseil, and was of hir rede.
      A gerlond hadde he sette upon his hede
      As gret as it were for an alestake:
      A bokeler hadde he made him of a cake.
      With him ther rode a gentil Pardonere--
      That hadde a vois as smale as hath a gote."

It would be a curious speculation (at least for those who think that
the characters of men never change, though manners, opinions, and
institutions may) to know what has become of this character of the
Sompnoure in the present day; whether or not it has any technical
representative in existing professions; into what channels and conduits
it has withdrawn itself, where it lurks unseen in cunning obscurity, or
else shews its face boldly, pampered into all the insolence of office,
in some other shape, as it is deterred or encouraged by circumstances.
_Chaucer's characters modernised_, upon this principle of historic
derivation, would be an useful addition to our knowledge of human
nature. But who is there to undertake it?

The descriptions of the equipage, and accoutrements of the two kings
of Thrace and Inde, in the Knight's Tale, are as striking and grand, as
the others are lively and natural:

      "Ther maist thou se coming with Palamon
      Licurge himself, the grete king of Trace:
      Blake was his berd, and manly was his face,
      The cercles of his eyen in his hed
      They gloweden betwixen yelwe and red,
      And like a griffon loked he about,
      With kemped heres on his browes stout;
      His limmes gret, his braunes hard and stronge,
      His shouldres brode, his armes round and longe
      And as the guise was in his contree,
      Ful highe upon a char of gold stood he,
      With foure white bolles in the trais.
      Instede of cote-armure on his harnais,
      With nayles yelwe, and bright as any gold,
      He hadde a beres skin, cole-blake for old.
      His longe here was kempt behind his bak,
      As any ravenes fether it shone for blake.
      A wreth of gold arm-gret, of huge weight,
      Upon his hed sate full of stones bright,
      Of fine rubins [sic] and of diamants.
      About his char ther wenten white alauns,
      Twenty and mo, as gret as any stere,
      To hunten at the leon or the dere,
      And folwed him, with mosel fast ybound.--
        With Arcita, in stories as men find,
      The grete Emetrius, the king of Inde,
      Upon a stede bay, trapped in stele,
      Covered with cloth of gold diapred wele,
      Came riding like the god of armes Mars.
      His cote-armure was of a cloth of Tars,
      Couched with perles, white, and round and grete.
      His sadel was of brent gold new ybete;
      A mantelet upon his shouldres hanging
      Bret-ful of rubies red, as fire sparkling.
      His crispe here like ringes was yronne,
      And that was yelwe, and glitered as the Sonne.
      His nose was high, his eyen bright citrin,
      His lippes round, his colour was sanguin,
      A fewe fraknes in his face yspreint,
      Betwixen yelwe and blake somdel ymeint,
      And as a leon he his loking caste.
      Of five and twenty yere his age I caste.
      His berd was wel begonnen for to spring;
      His vois was as a trompe thondering.
      Upon his hed he wered of laurer grene
      A gerlond freshe and lusty for to sene.
      Upon his hond he bare for his deduit
      An egle tame, as any lily whit.--
      About this king ther ran on every part
      Ful many a tame leon and leopart."

What a deal of terrible beauty there is contained in this
description! The imagination of a poet brings such objects before us, as
when we look at wild beasts in a menagerie; their claws are pared, their
eyes glitter like harmless lightning; but we gaze at them with a
pleasing awe, clothed in beauty, formidable in the sense of abstract
power.

Chaucer's descriptions of natural scenery possess the same sort of
characteristic excellence, or what might be termed _gusto_.  They have a
local truth and freshness, which gives the very feeling of the air, the
coolness or moisture of the ground.  Inanimate objects are thus made to
have a fellow-feeling in the interest of the story; and render back the
sentiment of the speaker's mind.  One of the finest parts of Chaucer is
of this mixed kind.  It is the beginning of the Flower and the Leaf,
where he describes the delight of that young beauty, shrowded in her
bower, and listening, in the morning of the year, to the singing of the
nightingale; while her joy rises with the rising song, and gushes out
afresh at every pause, and is borne along with the full tide of
pleasure, and still increases, and repeats, and prolongs itself, and
knows no ebb.  The coolness of the arbour, its retirement, the early time
of the day, the sudden starting up of the birds in the neighbouring
bushes, the eager delight with which they devour and rend the opening
buds and flowers, are expressed with a truth and feeling, which make the
whole appear like the recollection of an actual scene:

      "Which as me thought was right a pleasing sight,
      And eke the briddes song for to here,
      Would haue rejoyced any earthly wight,
      And I that couth not yet in no manere
      Heare the nightingale of all the yeare,
      Ful busily herkened with herte and with eare,
      If I her voice perceiue coud any where.

      And I that all this pleasaunt sight sie,
      Thought sodainly I felt so sweet an aire
      Of the eglentere, that certainely
      There is no herte I deme in such dispaire,
      Ne with thoughts froward and contraire,
      So ouerlaid, but it should soone haue bote,
      If it had ones felt this savour sote.

      And as I stood and cast aside mine eie,
      I was ware of the fairest medler tree
      That ever yet in all my life I sie
      As full of blossomes as it might be,
      Therein a goldfinch leaping pretile
      Fro bough to bough, and as him list he eet
      Here and there of buds and floures sweet.

      And to the herber side was joyning
      This faire tree, of which I haue you told,
      And at the last the brid began to sing,
      Whan he had eaten what he eat wold,
      So passing sweetly, that by manifold
      It was more pleasaunt than I coud deuise,
      And whan his song was ended in this wise,

      The nightingale with so merry a note
      Answered him, that all the wood rong
      So sodainly, that as it were a sote,
      I stood astonied, so was I with the song
      Thorow rauished, that till late and long,
      I ne wist in what place I was, ne where,
      And ayen me thought she song euen by mine ere.

      Wherefore I waited about busily
      On euery side, if I her might see,
      And at the last I gan full well aspie
      Where she sat in a fresh grene laurer tree,
      On the further side euen right by me,
      That gaue so passing a delicious smell,
      According to the eglentere full well.

      Whereof I had so inly great pleasure,
      That as me thought I surely rauished was
      Into Paradice, where my desire
      Was for to be, and no ferther passe
      As for that day, and on the sote grasse,
      I sat me downe, for as for mine entent,
      The birds song was more conuenient,

      And more pleasaunt to me by manifold,
      Than meat or drinke, or any other thing,
      Thereto the herber was so fresh and cold,
      The wholesome sauours eke so comforting,
      That as I demed, sith the beginning
      Of the world was neur seene or than
      So pleasaunt a ground of none earthly man.

      And as I sat the birds harkening thus,
      Me thought that I heard voices sodainly,
      The most sweetest and most delicious
      That euer any wight I trow truly
      Heard in their life, for the armony
      And sweet accord was in so good musike,
      That the uoice to angels was most like."

There is here no affected rapture, no flowery sentiment: the whole is
an ebullition of natural delight "welling out of the heart," like water
from a crystal spring.  Nature is the soul of art: there is a strength as
well as a simplicity in the imagination that reposes entirely on nature,
that nothing else can supply.  It was the same trust in nature, and
reliance on his subject, which enabled Chaucer to describe the grief and
patience of Griselda; the faith of Constance; and the heroic
perseverance of the little child, who, going to school through the
streets of Jewry,

      "Oh _Alma Redemptoris mater_, loudly sung,"

and who after his death still triumphed in his song.  Chaucer has more of
this deep, internal, sustained sentiment, than any other writer, except
Boccaccio.  In depth of simple pathos, and intensity of conception, never
swerving from his subject, I think no other writer comes near him, not
even the Greek tragedians.  I wish to be allowed to give one or two
instances of what I mean.  I will take the following from the Knight's
Tale.  The distress of Arcite, in consequence of his banishment from his
love, is thus described:

        "Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
      Ful oft a day he swelt and said Alas,
      For sene his lady shall he never mo.
      And shortly to concluden all his wo,
      So mochel sorwe hadde never creature,
      That is or shall be, while the world may dure.
      His slepe, his mete, his drinke is him byraft.
      That lene he wex, and drie as is a shaft.
      His eyen holwe, and grisly to behold,
      His hewe salwe, and pale as ashen cold,
      And solitary he was, and ever alone,
      And wailing all the night, making his mone.
      And if he herde song or instrument,
      Than wold he wepe, he mighte not be stent.
      So feble were his spirites, and so low,
      And changed so, that no man coude know
      His speche ne his vois, though men it herd."

This picture of the sinking of the heart, of the wasting away of the
body and mind, of the gradual failure of all the faculties under the
contagion of a rankling sorrow, cannot be surpassed.  Of the same kind is
his farewel to his mistress, after he has gained her hand and lost his
life in the combat:

        "Alas the wo! alas the peines stronge,
      That I for you have suffered, and so longe!
      Alas the deth! alas min Emilie!
      Alas departing of our compagnie;
      Alas min hertes quene! alas my wif!
      Min hertes ladie, ender of my lif!
      What is this world? what axen men to have?
      Now with his love, now in his colde grave
      Alone withouten any compagnie."

The death of Arcite is the more affecting, as it comes after triumph
and victory, after the pomp of sacrifice, the solemnities of prayer, the
celebration of the gorgeous rites of chivalry.  The descriptions of the
three temples of Mars, of Venus, and Diana, of the ornaments and
ceremonies used in each, with the reception given to the offerings of
the lovers, have a beauty and grandeur, much of which is lost in
Dryden's version.  For instance, such lines as the following are not
rendered with their true feeling.

      "Why shulde I not as well eke tell you all
      The purtreiture that was upon the wall
      Within the temple of mighty Mars the rede--
      That highte the gret temple of Mars in Trace
      In thilke colde and frosty region,
      Ther as Mars hath his sovereine mansion.
      First on the wall was peinted a forest,
      In which ther wonneth neyther man ne best,
      With knotty knarry barrein trees old
      Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to behold;
      In which ther ran a romble and a swough,
      As though a storme shuld bresten every bough."

And again, among innumerable terrific images of death and slaughter
painted on the wall, is this one:

      "The statue of Mars upon a carte stood
      Armed, and looked grim as he were wood.
      A wolf ther stood beforne him at his fete
      With eyen red, and of a man he ete."

The story of Griselda is in Boccaccio; but the Clerk of Oxenforde,
who tells it, professes to have learned it from Petrarch.  This story has
gone all over Europe, and has passed into a proverb.  In spite of the
barbarity of the circumstances, which are abominable, the sentiment
remains unimpaired and unalterable.  It is of that kind, "that heaves no
sigh, that sheds no tear"; but it hangs upon the beatings of the heart;
it is a part of the very being; it is as inseparable from it as the
breath we draw.  It is still and calm as the face of death.  Nothing can
touch it in its ethereal purity: tender as the yielding flower, it is
fixed as the marble firmament.  The only remonstrance she makes, the only
complaint she utters against all the ill-treatment she receives, is that
single line where, when turned back naked to her father's house, she
says,

      "Let me not like a worm go by the way."

The first outline given of the character is inimitable:

      "Nought fer fro thilke paleis honourable,
      Wher as this markis shope his marriage,
      Ther stood a thorpe, of sighte delitable,
      In which that poure folk of that village
      Hadden hir bestes and her herbergage,
      And of hir labour toke hir sustenance,
      After that the erthe yave hem habundance.

      Among this poure folk ther dwelt a man,
      Which that was holden pourest of hem all:
      But highe God sometime senden can
      His grace unto a litel oxes stall:
      Janicola men of that thorpe him call.
      A doughter had he, faire ynough to sight,
      And Grisildis this yonge maiden hight.

      But for to speke of vertuous beautee,
      Than was she on the fairest under Sonne:
      Ful pourely yfostred up was she:
      No likerous lust was in hire herte yronne;
      Ful ofter of the well than of the tonne
      She dranke, and for she wolde vertue plese,
      She knew wel labour, but non idel ese.

      But though this mayden tendre were of age,
      Yet in the brest of hire virginitee
      Ther was enclosed sad and ripe corage:
      And in gret reverence and charitee
      Hire olde poure fader fostred she:
      A few sheep spinning on the feld she kept,
      She wolde not ben idel til she slept.

      And whan she homward came she wolde bring
      Wortes and other herbes times oft,
      The which she shred and sethe for hire living,
      And made hire bed ful hard, and nothing soft:
      And ay she kept hire fadres lif on loft
      With every obeisance and diligence,
      That child may don to fadres reverence,

      Upon Grisilde, this poure creature,
      Ful often sithe this markis sette his sye, [sic]
      As he on hunting rode paraventure:
      And whan it fell that he might hire espie,
      He not with wanton loking of folie
      His eyen cast on hire, but in sad wise
      Upon hire chere he wold him oft avise,

      Commending in his herte hire womanhede,
      And eke hire vertue, passing any wight
      Of so yong age, as wel in chere as dede.
      For though the people have no gret insight
      In vertue, he considered ful right
      Hire bountee, and disposed that he wold
      Wedde hire only, if ever he wedden shold.

      Grisilde of this (God wot) ful innocent,
      That for hire shapen was all this array,
      To fetchen water at a welle is went,
      And cometh home as sone as ever she may.
      For wel she had herd say, that thilke day
      The markis shulde wedde, and, if she might,
      She wolde fayn han seen som of that sight.

      She thought, "I wol with other maidens stond,
      That ben my felawes, in our dore, and see
      The markisesse, and therto wol I fond
      To don at home, as sone as it may be,
      The labour which longeth unto me,
      And than I may at leiser hire behold,
      If she this way unto the castel hold."

      And she wolde over the threswold gon,
      The markis came and gan hire for to call,
      And she set doun her water-pot anon
      Beside the threswold in an oxes stall,
      And doun upon hire knees she gan to fall.
      And with sad countenance kneleth still,
      Till she had herd what was the lordes will."

The story of the little child slain in Jewry, (which is told by the
Prioress, and worthy to be told by her who was "all conscience and
tender heart,") is not less touching than that of Griselda.  It is simple
and heroic to the last degree.  The poetry of Chaucer has a religious
sanctity about it, connected with the manners and superstitions of the
age.  It has all the spirit of martyrdom.

It has also all the extravagance and the utmost licentiousness of
comic humour, equally arising out of the manners of the time.  In this
too Chaucer resembled Boccaccio that he excelled in both styles, and
could pass at will "from grave to gay, from lively to severe"; but he
never confounded the two styles together (except from that involuntary
and unconscious mixture of the pathetic and humorous, which is almost
always to be found in nature,) and was exclusively taken up with what he
set about, whether it was jest or earnest.  The Wife of Bath's Prologue
(which Pope has very admirably modernised) is, perhaps, unequalled as a
comic story.  The Cock and the Fox is also excellent for lively strokes
of character and satire.  January and May is not so good as some of the
others.  Chaucer's versification, considering the time at which he wrote,
and that versification is a thing in a great degree mechanical, is not
one of his least merits.  It has considerable strength and harmony, and
its apparent deficiency in the latter respect arises chiefly from the
alterations which have since taken place in the pronunciation or mode of
accenting the words of the language.  The best general rule for reading
him is to pronounce the final _e_, as in reading Italian.

It was observed in the last Lecture that painting describes what the
object is in itself, poetry what it implies or suggests.  Chaucer's
poetry is not, in general, the best confirmation of the truth of this
distinction, for his poetry is more picturesque and historical than
almost any other.  But there is one instance in point which I cannot help
giving in this place.  It is the story of the three thieves who go in
search of Death to kill him, and who meeting with him, are entangled in
their fate by his words, without knowing him.  In the printed catalogue
to Mr. West's (in some respects very admirable) picture of Death on the
Pale Horse, it is observed, that "In poetry the same effect is produced
by a few abrupt and rapid gleams of description, touching, as it were
with fire, the features and edges of a general mass of awful obscurity;
but in painting, such indistinctness would be a defect, and imply that
the artist wanted the power to pourtray the conceptions of his fancy.
Mr. West was of opinion that to delineate a physical form, which in its
moral impression would approximate to that of the visionary Death of
Milton, it was necessary to endow it, if possible, with the appearance
of super-human strength and energy.  He has therefore exerted the utmost
force and perspicuity of his pencil on the central figure."--One might
suppose from this, that the way to represent a shadow was to make it as
substantial as possible.  Oh, no! Painting has its prerogatives, (and
high ones they are) but they lie in representing the visible, not the
invisible.  The moral attributes of Death are powers and effects of an
infinitely wide and general description, which no individual or physical
form can possibly represent, but by a courtesy of speech, or by a
distant analogy.  The moral impression of Death is essentially visionary;
its reality is in the mind's eye.  Words are here the only _things_; and
things, physical forms, the mere mockeries of the understanding.  The
less definite, the less bodily the conception, the more vast, unformed,
and unsubstantial, the nearer does it approach to some resemblance of
that omnipresent, lasting, universal, irresistible principle, which
every where, and at some time or other, exerts its power over all
things.  Death is a mighty abstraction, like Night, or Space, or Time.  He
is an ugly customer, who will not be invited to supper, or to sit for
his picture.  He is with us and about us, but we do not see him.  He
stalks on before us, and we do not mind him: he follows us close behind,
and we do not turn to look back at him.  We do not see him making faces
at us in our life-time, nor perceive him afterwards sitting in
mock-majesty, a twin-skeleton, beside us, tickling our bare ribs, and
staring into our hollow eye-balls! Chaucer knew this.  He makes three
riotous companions go in search of Death to kill him, they meet with an
old man whom they reproach with his age, and ask why he does not die, to
which he answers thus:

      "Ne Deth, alas! ne will not han my lif.
      Thus walke I like a restless caitiff,
      And on the ground, which is my modres gate,
      I knocke with my staf, erlich and late,
      And say to hire, "Leve mother, let me in.
      Lo, how I vanish, flesh and blood and skin,
      Alas! when shall my bones ben at reste?
      Mother, with you wolde I changen my cheste,
      That in my chambre longe time hath be,
      Ye, for an heren cloute to wrap in me."
      But yet to me she will not don that grace,
      For which ful pale and welked is my face."

They then ask the old man where they shall find out Death to kill
him, and he sends them on an errand which ends in the death of all
three. We hear no more of him, but it is Death that they have
encountered!

The interval between Chaucer and Spenser is long and dreary.  There is
nothing to fill up the chasm but the names of Occleve, "ancient Gower,"
Lydgate, Wyatt, Surry, and Sackville.  Spenser flourished in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, and was sent with Sir John Davies into Ireland, of
which he has left behind him some tender recollections in his
description of the bog of Allan, and a record in an ably written paper,
containing observations on the state of that country and the means of
improving it, which remain in full force to the present day.  Spenser
died at an obscure inn in London, it is supposed in distressed
circumstances.  The treatment he received from Burleigh is well known.
Spenser, as well as Chaucer, was engaged in active life; but the genius
of his poetry was not active: it is inspired by the love of ease, and
relaxation from all the cares and business of life.  Of all the poets, he
is the most poetical.  Though much later than Chaucer, his obligations to
preceding writers were less.  He has in some measure borrowed the plan of
his poem (as a number of distinct narratives) from Ariosto; but he has
engrafted upon it an exuberance of fancy, and an endless voluptuousness
of sentiment, which are not to be found in the Italian writer.  Farther,
Spenser is even more of an inventor in the subject-matter.  There is an
originality, richness, and variety in his allegorical personages and
fictions, which almost vies with the splendor of the ancient mythology.
If Ariosto transports us into the regions of romance, Spenser's poetry
is all fairy-land.  In Ariosto, we walk upon the ground, in a company,
gay, fantastic, and adventurous enough.  In Spenser, we wander in another
world, among ideal beings.  The poet takes and lays us in the lap of a
lovelier nature, by the sound of softer streams, among greener hills and
fairer valleys.  He paints nature, not as we find it, but as we expected
to find it; and fulfils the delightful promise of our youth.  He waves
his wand of enchantment--and at once embodies airy beings, and throws
a delicious veil over all actual objects.  The two worlds of reality and
of fiction are poised on the wings of his imagination.  His ideas,
indeed, seem more distinct than his perceptions.  He is the painter of
abstractions, and describes them with dazzling minuteness.  In the Mask
of Cupid he makes the God of Love "clap on high his coloured winges
_twain_": and it is said of Gluttony, in the Procession of the Passions,

      "In green vine leaves he was right fitly clad."

At times he becomes picturesque from his intense love of beauty; as
where he compares Prince Arthur's crest to the appearance of the almond
tree:

      "Upon the top of all his lofty crest,
        A bunch of hairs discolour'd diversely
      With sprinkled pearl and gold full richly drest
        Did shake and seem'd to daunce for jollity;
      Like to an almond tree ymounted high
        On top of green Selenis all alone,
      With blossoms brave bedecked daintily;
        Her tender locks do tremble every one
      At every little breath that under heav'n is blown."

The love of beauty, however, and not of truth, is the moving principle
of his mind; and he is guided in his fantastic delineations by no rule
but the impulse of an inexhaustible imagination.  He luxuriates equally
in scenes of Eastern magnificence; or the still solitude of a hermit's
cell--in the extremes of sensuality or refinement.

In reading the Faery Queen, you see a little withered old man by a
wood-side opening a wicket, a giant, and a dwarf lagging far behind, a
damsel in a boat upon an enchanted lake, wood-nymphs, and satyrs, and
all of a sudden you are transported into a lofty palace, with tapers
burning, amidst knights and ladies, with dance and revelry, and song,
"and mask, and antique pageantry." What can be more solitary, more shut
up in itself, than his description of the house of Sleep, to which
Archimago sends for a dream:

      "And more to lull him in his slumber soft
        A trickling stream from high rock tumbling down,
      And ever-drizzling rain upon the loft,
        Mix'd with a murmuring wind, much like the sound
      Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swound.
        No other noise, nor people's troublous cries.
      That still are wont t' annoy the walled town
        Might there be heard; but careless Quiet lies
      Wrapt in eternal silence, far from enemies."

It is as if "the honey-heavy dew of slumber" had settled on his pen in
writing these lines.  How different in the subject (and yet how like in
beauty) is the following description of the Bower of Bliss:

      "Eftsoones they heard a most melodious sound
        Of all that mote delight a dainty ear;
      Such as at once might not on living ground,
        Save in this Paradise, be heard elsewhere:
      Right hard it was for wight which did it hear,
        To tell what manner musicke that mote be;
      For all that pleasing is to living eare
        Was there consorted in one harmonee:
      Birds, voices, instruments, windes, waters, all agree.

      The joyous birdes shrouded in chearefull shade
        Their notes unto the voice attempred sweet:
      The angelical soft trembling voices made
        To th' instruments divine respondence meet.
      The silver sounding instruments did meet
        With the base murmur of the water's fall;
      The water's fall with difference discreet,
        Now soft, now loud, unto the wind did call;
      The gentle warbling wind low answered to all."

The remainder of the passage has all that voluptuous pathos, and languid
brilliancy of fancy, in which this writer excelled:

      "The whiles some one did chaunt this lovely lay;
        Ah! see, whoso fayre thing dost thou fain to see,
      In springing flower the image of thy day!
        Ah! see the virgin rose, how sweetly she
      Doth first peep forth with bashful modesty,
        That fairer seems the less ye see her may!
      Lo! see soon after, how more bold and free
        Her bared bosom she doth broad display;
      Lo! see soon after, how she fades and falls away!

      So passeth in the passing of a day
        Of mortal life the leaf, the bud, the flower;
      Ne more doth flourish after first decay,
        That erst was sought to deck both bed and bower
      Of many a lady and many a paramour!
        Gather therefore the rose whilst yet is prime,
      For soon comes age that will her pride deflower;
        Gather the rose of love whilst yet is time,
      Whilst loving thou mayst loved be with equal crime. [2]

      He ceased; and then gan all the quire of birds
        Their divers notes to attune unto his lay,
      As in approvance of his pleasing wordes.
        The constant pair heard all that he did say,
      Yet swerved not, but kept their forward way
        Through many covert groves and thickets close,
      In which they creeping did at last display [3]
        That wanton lady with her lover loose,
      Whose sleepy head she in her lap did soft dispose.

      Upon a bed of roses she was laid
        As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin;
      And was arrayed or rather disarrayed,
        All in a veil of silk and silver thin,
      That hid no whit her alabaster skin,
        But rather shewed more white, if more might be:
      More subtle web Arachne cannot spin;
        Nor the fine nets, which oft we woven see
      Of scorched dew, do not in the air more lightly flee.

      Her snowy breast was bare to greedy spoil
        Of hungry eyes which n' ote therewith be fill'd,
      And yet through languor of her late sweet toil
        Few drops more clear than nectar forth distill'd,
      That like pure Orient perles adown it trill'd;
        And her fair eyes sweet smiling in delight
      Moisten'd their fiery beams, with which she thrill'd
        Frail hearts, yet quenched not; like starry light,
      Which sparkling on the silent waves does seem more bright."

The finest things in Spenser are, the character of Una, in the first
book; the House of Pride; the Cave of Mammon, and the Cave of Despair;
the account of Memory, of whom it is said, among other things,

      "The wars he well remember'd of King Nine,
      Of old Assaracus and Inachus divine";

the description of Belphoebe; the story of Florimel and the Witch's son;
the Gardens of Adonis, and the Bower of Bliss; the Mask of Cupid; and
Colin Clout's vision, in the last book.  But some people will say that
all this may be very fine, but that they cannot understand it on account
of the allegory.  They are afraid of the allegory, as if they thought it
would bite them: they look at it as a child looks at a painted dragon,
and think it will strangle them in its shining folds.  This is very idle.
If they do not meddle with the allegory, the allegory will not meddle
with them.  Without minding it at all, the whole is as plain as a
pike-staff.  It might as well be pretended that we cannot see Poussin's
pictures for the allegory, as that the allegory prevents us from
understanding Spenser.  For instance, when Britomart, seated amidst the
young warriors, lets fall her hair and discovers her sex, is it
necessary to know the part she plays in the allegory, to understand the
beauty of the following stanza?

      "And eke that stranger knight amongst the rest
        Was for like need enforc'd to disarray.
      Tho when as vailed was her lofty crest,
        Her golden locks that were in trammels gay
      Upbounden, did themselves adown display,
        And raught unto her heels like sunny beams
      That in a cloud their light did long time stay;
        Their vapour faded, shew their golden gleams,
      And through the persant air shoot forth their azure streams."

Or is there any mystery in what is said of Belphoebe, that her hair was
sprinkled with flowers and blossoms which had been entangled in it as
she fled through the woods? Or is it necessary to have a more distinct
idea of Proteus, than that which is given of him in his boat, with the
frighted Florimel at his feet, while

      "------the cold icicles from his rough beard
      Dropped adown upon her snowy breast!"

Or is it not a sufficient account of one of the sea-gods that pass by
them, to say--

      "That was Arion crowned:--
      So went he playing on the watery plain."

Or to take the Procession of the Passions that draw the coach of Pride,
in which the figures of Idleness, of Gluttony, of Lechery, of Avarice,
of Envy, and of Wrath speak, one should think, plain enough for
themselves; such as this of Gluttony:

      "And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony,
        Deformed creature, on a filthy swine;
      His belly was up blown with luxury;
        And eke with fatness swollen were his eyne;
      And like a crane his neck was long and fine,
        With which he swallowed up excessive feast,
    For want whereof poor people oft did pine.

      In green vine leaves he was right fitly clad;
        For other clothes he could not wear for heat:
      And on his head an ivy garland had,
        From under which fast trickled down the sweat:
      Still as he rode, he somewhat still did eat.
        And in his hand did bear a bouzing can,
      Of which he supt so oft, that on his seat
        His drunken corse he scarce upholden can;
    In shape and size more like a monster than a man."

Or this of Lechery:

      "And next to him rode lustfull Lechery
        Upon a bearded goat, whose rugged hair
      And whaly eyes (the sign of jealousy)
        Was like the person's self whom he did bear:
      Who rough and black, and filthy did appear.
        Unseemly man to please fair lady's eye:
      Yet he of ladies oft was loved dear,
        When fairer faces were bid standen by:
    O! who does know the bent of woman's fantasy?

      In a green gown he clothed was full fair,
        Which underneath did hide his filthiness;
      And in his hand a burning heart he bare,
        Full of vain follies and new fangleness;
      For he was false and fraught with fickleness;
        And learned had to love with secret looks;
      And well could dance; and sing with ruefulness;
        And fortunes tell; and read in loving books;
    And thousand other ways to bait his fleshly hooks.

      Inconstant man that loved all he saw,
        And lusted after all that he did love;
      Ne would his looser life be tied to law;
        But joyed weak women's hearts to tempt and prove,
    If from their loyal loves he might them move."

This is pretty plain-spoken.  Mr. Southey says of Spenser:

                "------Yet not more sweet
      Than pure was he, and not more pure than wise;
      High priest of all the Muses' mysteries!"

On the contrary, no one was more apt to pry into mysteries which do not
strictly belong to the Muses.

Of the same kind with the Procession of the Passions, as little
obscure, and still more beautiful, is the Mask of Cupid, with his train
of votaries:

      "The first was Fancy, like a lovely boy
        Of rare aspect, and beauty without peer;

      His garment neither was of silk nor say,
        But painted plumes in goodly order dight,
      Like as the sun-burnt Indians do array
        Their tawny bodies in their proudest plight:
      As those same plumes so seem'd he vain and light,
        That by his gait might easily appear;
      For still he far'd as dancing in delight,
        And in his hand a windy fan did bear
    That in the idle air he mov'd still here and there.

      And him beside march'd amorous Desire,
        Who seem'd of riper years than the other swain,
      Yet was that other swain this elder's sire,
        And gave him being, common to them twain:
      His garment was disguised very vain,
        And his embroidered bonnet sat awry;
      Twixt both his hands few sparks he close did strain,
        Which still he blew, and kindled busily,
    That soon they life conceiv'd and forth in flames did fly.

      Next after him went Doubt, who was yclad
        In a discolour'd coat of strange disguise,
      That at his back a broad capuccio had,
        And sleeves dependant _Albanese-wise_;
      He lookt askew with his mistrustful eyes,
        And nicely trod, as thorns lay in his way,
      Or that the floor to shrink he did avise;
        And on a broken reed he still did stay
    His feeble steps, which shrunk when hard thereon he lay.

      With him went Daunger, cloth'd in ragged weed,
        Made of bear's skin, that him more dreadful made;
      Yet his own face was dreadfull, ne did need
        Strange horror to deform his grisly shade;
      A net in th' one hand, and a rusty blade
        In th' other was; this Mischiefe, that Mishap;
      With th' one his foes he threat'ned to invade,
        With th' other he his friends meant to enwrap;
    For whom he could not kill he practiz'd to entrap.

      Next him was Fear, all arm'd from top to toe,
        Yet thought himselfe not safe enough thereby,
      But fear'd each shadow moving to and fro;
        And his own arms when glittering he did spy
      Or clashing heard, he fast away did fly,
        As ashes pale of hue, and winged-heel'd;
      And evermore on Daunger fixt his eye,
        'Gainst whom he always bent a brazen shield,
    Which his right hand unarmed fearfully did wield.

      With him went Hope in rank, a handsome maid,
        Of chearfull look and lovely to behold;
      In silken samite she was light array'd,
        And her fair locks were woven up in gold;
      She always smil'd, and in her hand did hold
        An holy-water sprinkle dipt in dew,
      With which she sprinkled favours manifold
        On whom she list, and did great liking shew,
    Great liking unto many, but true love to few.

      Next after them, the winged God himself
        Came riding on a lion ravenous,
      Taught to obey the menage of that elfe
        That man and beast with power imperious
      Subdueth to his kingdom tyrannous:
        His blindfold eyes he bade awhile unbind,
      That his proud spoil of that same dolorous
        Fair dame he might behold in perfect kind;
    Which seen, he much rejoiced in his cruel mind.

      Of which full proud, himself uprearing high,
        He looked round about with stern disdain,
      And did survey his goodly company:
        And marshalling the evil-ordered train,
      With that the darts which his right hand did strain,
        Full dreadfully he shook, that all did quake,
      And clapt on high his colour'd winges twain,
        That all his many it afraid did make:
    Tho, blinding him again, his way he forth did take."

The description of Hope, in this series of historical portraits, is one
of the most beautiful in Spenser: and the triumph of Cupid at the
mischief he has made, is worthy of the malicious urchin deity.  In
reading these descriptions, one can hardly avoid being reminded of
Rubens's allegorical pictures; but the account of Satyrane taming the
lion's whelps and lugging the bear's cubs along in his arms while yet an
infant, whom his mother so naturally advises to "go seek some other
play-fellows," has even more of this high picturesque character.  Nobody
but Rubens could have painted the fancy of Spenser; and he could not
have given the sentiment, the airy dream that hovers over it! With all
this, Spenser neither makes us laugh nor weep.  The only jest in his poem
is an allegorical play upon words, where he describes Malbecco as
escaping in the herd of goats, "by the help of his fayre hornes on
hight." But he has been unjustly charged with a want of passion and of
strength.  He has both in an immense degree.  He has not indeed the pathos
of immediate action or suffering, which is more properly the dramatic;
but he has all the pathos of sentiment and romance--all that belongs
to distant objects of terror, and uncertain, imaginary distress.  His
strength, in like manner, is not strength of will or action, of bone and
muscle, nor is it coarse and palpable--but it assumes a character of
vastness and sublimity seen through the same visionary medium, and
blended with the appalling associations of preternatural agency.  We need
only turn, in proof of this, to the Cave of Despair, or the Cave of
Mammon, or to the account of the change of Malbecco into Jealousy.  The
following stanzas, in the description of the Cave of Mammon, the grisly
house of Plutus, are unrivalled for the portentous massiness of the
forms, the splendid chiaro-scuro, and shadowy horror.

      "That house's form within was rude and strong,
        Like an huge cave hewn out of rocky clift,
      From whose rough vault the ragged breaches hung,
        Embossed with massy gold of glorious gift,
      And with rich metal loaded every rift,
        That heavy ruin they did seem to threat:
      And over them Arachne high did lift
        Her cunning web, and spread her subtle net,
    Enwrapped in foul smoke, and clouds more black than jet.

      Both roof and floor, and walls were all of gold,
        But overgrown with dust and old decay, [4]
      And hid in darkness that none could behold
        The hue thereof: for view of cheerful day
      Did never in that house itself display,
        But a faint shadow of uncertain light;
      Such as a lamp whose life doth fade away;
        Or as the moon clothed with cloudy night
    Does shew to him that walks in fear and sad affright.

      *   *   *   *   *   *   *

      And over all sad Horror with grim hue
        Did always soar, beating his iron wings;
      And after him owls and night-ravens flew,
        The hateful messengers of heavy things,
      Of death and dolour telling sad tidings;
        Whiles sad Celleno, sitting on a clift,
      A song of bitter bale and sorrow sings,
        That heart of flint asunder could have rift;
    Which having ended, after him she flieth swift."

The Cave of Despair is described with equal gloominess and power of
fancy; and the fine moral declamation of the owner of it, on the evils
of life, almost makes one in love with death.  In the story of Malbecco,
who is haunted by jealousy, and in vain strives to run away from his own
thoughts--

      "High over hill and over dale he flies"--

the truth of human passion and the preternatural ending are equally
striking.--It is not fair to compare Spenser with Shakspeare, in point
of interest.  A fairer comparison would be with Comus; and the result
would not be unfavourable to Spenser.  There is only one work of the same
allegorical kind, which has more interest than Spenser (with scarcely
less imagination): and that is the Pilgrim's Progress.  The three first
books of the Faery Queen are very superior to the three last.  One would
think that Pope, who used to ask if any one had ever read the Faery
Queen through, had only dipped into these last.  The only things in them
equal to the former, are the account of Talus, the Iron Man, and the
delightful episode of Pastorella.

The language of Spenser is full, and copious, to overflowing; it is
less pure and idiomatic than Chaucer's, and is enriched and adorned with
phrases borrowed from the different languages of Europe, both ancient
and modern.  He was, probably, seduced into a certain license of
expression by the difficulty of filling up the moulds of his complicated
rhymed stanza from the limited resources of his native language.  This
stanza, with alternate and repeatedly recurring rhymes, is borrowed from
the Italians.  It was peculiarly fitted to their language, which abounds
in similar vowel terminations, and is as little adapted to ours, from
the stubborn, unaccommodating resistance which the consonant endings of
the northern languages make to this sort of endless sing-song.--Not
that I would, on that account, part with the stanza of Spenser.  We are,
perhaps, indebted to this very necessity of finding out new forms of
expression, and to the occasional faults to which it led, for a poetical
language rich and varied and magnificent beyond all former, and almost
all later example.  His versification is, at once, the most smooth and
the most sounding in the language.  It is a labyrinth of sweet sounds,
"in many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out"--that
would cloy by their very sweetness, but that the ear is constantly
relieved and enchanted by their continued variety of modulation--
dwelling on the pauses of the action, or flowing on in a fuller tide of
harmony with the movement of the sentiment.  It has not the bold dramatic
transitions of Shakspeare's blank verse, nor the high-raised tone of
Milton's; but it is the perfection of melting harmony, dissolving the
soul in pleasure, or holding it captive in the chains of suspense.
Spenser was the poet of our waking dreams; and he has invented not only
a language, but a music of his own for them.  The undulations are
infinite, like those of the waves of the sea: but the effect is still
the same, lulling the senses into a deep oblivion of the jarring noises
of the world, from which we have no wish to be ever recalled.




LECTURE III.
ON SHAKSPEARE AND MILTON.


In looking back to the great works of genius in former times, we are
sometimes disposed to wonder at the little progress which has since been
made in poetry, and in the arts of imitation in general.  But this is
perhaps a foolish wonder.  Nothing can be more contrary to the fact, than
the supposition that in what we understand by the _fine arts_, as
painting, and poetry, relative perfection is only the result of repeated
efforts in successive periods, and that what has been once well done,
constantly leads to something better.  What is mechanical, reducible to
rule, or capable of demonstration, is progressive, and admits of gradual
improvement: what is not mechanical, or definite, but depends on
feeling, taste, and genius, very soon becomes stationary, or retrograde,
and loses more than it gains by transfusion.  The contrary opinion is a
vulgar error, which has grown up, like many others, from transferring an
analogy of one kind to something quite distinct, without taking into the
account the difference in the nature of the things, or attending to the
difference of the results.  For most persons, finding what wonderful
advances have been made in biblical criticism, in chemistry, in
mechanics, in geometry, astronomy, &c. _i.e._ in things depending on
mere inquiry and experiment, or on absolute demonstration, have been led
hastily to conclude, that there was a general tendency in the efforts of
the human intellect to improve by repetition, and, in all other arts and
institutions, to grow perfect and mature by time.  We look back upon the
theological creed of our ancestors, and their discoveries in natural
philosophy, with a smile of pity: science, and the arts connected with
it, have all had their infancy, their youth, and manhood, and seem to
contain in them no principle of limitation or decay: and, inquiring no
farther about the matter, we infer, in the intoxication of our pride,
and the height of our self-congratulation, that the same progress has
been made, and will continue to be made, in all other things which are
the work of man.  The fact, however, stares us so plainly in the face,
that one would think the smallest reflection must suggest the truth, and
overturn our sanguine theories.  The greatest poets, the ablest orators,
the best painters, and the finest sculptors that the world ever saw,
appeared soon after the birth of these arts, and lived in a state of
society which was, in other respects, comparatively barbarous.  Those
arts, which depend on individual genius and incommunicable power, have
always leaped at once from infancy to manhood, from the first rude dawn
of invention to their meridian height and dazzling lustre, and have in
general declined ever after.  This is the peculiar distinction and
privilege of each, of science and of art:--of the one, never to attain
its utmost limit of perfection; and of the other, to arrive at it almost
at once.  Homer, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Dante, and Ariosto,
(Milton alone was of a later age, and not the worse for it)--Raphael,
Titian, Michael Angelo, Correggio, Cervantes, and Boccaccio, the Greek
sculptors and tragedians,--all lived near the beginning of their arts
--perfected, and all but created them.  These giant-sons of genius stand
indeed upon the earth, but they tower above their fellows; and the long
line of their successors, in different ages, does not interpose any
object to obstruct their view, or lessen their brightness.  In strength
and stature they are unrivalled; in grace and beauty they have not been
surpassed.  In after-ages, and more refined periods, (as they are called)
great men have arisen, one by one, as it were by throes and at
intervals; though in general the best of these cultivated and artificial
minds were of an inferior order; as Tasso and Pope, among poets; Guido
and Vandyke, among painters.  But in the earlier stages of the arts, as
soon as the first mechanical difficulties had been got over, and the
language was sufficiently acquired, they rose by clusters, and in
constellations, never so to rise again!

The arts of painting and poetry are conversant with the world of
thought within us, and with the world of sense around us--with what we
know, and see, and feel intimately.  They flow from the sacred shrine of
our own breasts, and are kindled at the living lamp of nature.  But the
pulse of the passions assuredly beat as high, the depths and soundings
of the human heart were as well understood three thousand, or three
hundred years ago, as they are at present: the face of nature, and "the
human face divine" shone as bright then as they have ever done.  But it
is _their_ light, reflected by true genius on art, that marks out its
path before it, and sheds a glory round the Muses' feet, like that which

               "Circled Una's angel face,
      And made a sunshine in the shady place."

The four greatest names in English poetry, are almost the four first
we come to--Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, and Milton.  There are no
others that can really be put in competition with these.  The two last
have had justice done them by the voice of common fame.  Their names are
blazoned in the very firmament of reputation; while the two first
(though "the fault has been more in their stars than in themselves that
they are underlings") either never emerged far above the horizon, or
were too soon involved in the obscurity of time.  The three first of
these are excluded from Dr. Johnson's Lives of the Poets (Shakspeare
indeed is so from the dramatic form of his compositions): and the
fourth, Milton, is admitted with a reluctant and churlish welcome.

In comparing these four writers together, it might be said that
Chaucer excels as the poet of manners, or of real life; Spenser, as the
poet of romance; Shakspeare as the poet of nature (in the largest use of
the term); and Milton, as the poet of morality.  Chaucer most frequently
describes things as they are; Spenser, as we wish them to be;
Shakspeare, as they would be; and Milton as they ought to be.  As poets,
and as great poets, imagination, that is, the power of feigning things
according to nature, was common to them all: but the principle or moving
power, to which this faculty was most subservient in Chaucer, was habit,
or inveterate prejudice; in Spenser, novelty, and the love of the
marvellous; in Shakspeare, it was the force of passion, combined with
every variety of possible circumstances; and in Milton, only with the
highest.  The characteristic of Chaucer is intensity; of Spenser,
remoteness; of Milton, elevation; of Shakspeare, every thing.--It has
been said by some critic, that Shakspeare was distinguished from the
other dramatic writers of his day only by his wit; that they had all his
other qualities but that; that one writer had as much sense, another as
much fancy, another as much knowledge of character, another the same
depth of passion, and another as great a power of language.  This
statement is not true; nor is the inference from it well-founded, even
if it were.  This person does not seem to have been aware that, upon his
own shewing, the great distinction of Shakspeare's genius was its
virtually including the genius of all the great men of his age, and not
his differing from them in one accidental particular.  But to have done
with such minute and literal trifling.

The striking peculiarity of Shakspeare's mind was its generic
quality, its power of communication with all other minds--so that it
contained a universe of thought and feeling within itself, and had no
one peculiar bias, or exclusive excellence more than another.  He was
just like any other man, but that he was like all other men.  He was the
least of an egotist that it was possible to be.  He was nothing in
himself; but he was all that others were, or that they could become.  He
not only had in himself the germs of every faculty and feeling, but he
could follow them by anticipation, intuitively, into all their
conceivable ramifications, through every change of fortune or conflict
of passion, or turn of thought.  He had "a mind reflecting ages past,"
and present:--all the people that ever lived are there.  There was no
respect of persons with him.  His genius shone equally on the evil and on
the good, on the wise and the foolish, the monarch and the beggar: "All
corners of the earth, kings, queens, and states, maids, matrons, nay,
the secrets of the grave," are hardly hid from his searching glance.  He
was like the genius of humanity, changing places with all of us at
pleasure, and playing with our purposes as with his own.  He turned the
globe round for his amusement, and surveyed the generations of men, and
the individuals as they passed, with their different concerns, passions,
follies, vices, virtues, actions, and motives--as well those that they
knew, as those which they did not know, or acknowledge to themselves.
The dreams of childhood, the ravings of despair, were the toys of his
fancy.  Airy beings waited at his call, and came at his bidding.  Harmless
fairies "nodded to him, and did him curtesies": and the night-hag
bestrode the blast at the command of "his so potent art." The world of
spirits lay open to him, like the world of real men and women: and there
is the same truth in his delineations of the one as of the other; for if
the preternatural characters he describes could be supposed to exist,
they would speak, and feel, and act, as he makes them.  He had only to
think of any thing in order to become that thing, with all the
circumstances belonging to it.  When he conceived of a character, whether
real or imaginary, he not only entered into all its thoughts and
feelings, but seemed instantly, and as if by touching a secret spring,
to be surrounded with all the same objects, "subject to the same skyey
influences," the same local, outward, and unforeseen accidents which
would occur in reality.  Thus the character of Caliban not only stands
before us with a language and manners of its own, but the scenery and
situation of the enchanted island he inhabits, the traditions of the
place, its strange noises, its hidden recesses, "his frequent haunts and
ancient neighbourhood," are given with a miraculous truth of nature, and
with all the familiarity of an old recollection.  The whole "coheres
semblably together" in time, place, and circumstance.  In reading this
author, you do not merely learn what his characters say,--you see their
persons.  By something expressed or understood, you are at no loss to
decypher their peculiar physiognomy, the meaning of a look, the
grouping, the bye-play, as we might see it on the stage.  A word, an
epithet paints a whole scene, or throws us back whole years in the
history of the person represented.  So (as it has been ingeniously
remarked) when Prospero describes himself as left alone in the boat with
his daughter, the epithet which he applies to her, "Me and thy _crying_
self," flings the imagination instantly back from the grown woman to the
helpless condition of infancy, and places the first and most trying
scene of his misfortunes before us, with all that he must have suffered
in the interval.  How well the silent anguish of Macduff is conveyed to
the reader, by the friendly expostulation of Malcolm--"What! man,
ne'er pull your hat upon your brows!" Again, Hamlet, in the scene with
Rosencrans and Guildenstern, somewhat abruptly concludes his fine
soliloquy on life by saying, "Man delights not me, nor woman neither,
though by your smiling you seem to say so." Which is explained by their
answer--"My lord, we had no such stuff in our thoughts.  But we smiled
to think, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the
players shall receive from you, whom we met on the way":--as if while
Hamlet was making this speech, his two old schoolfellows from Wittenberg
had been really standing by, and he had seen them smiling by stealth, at
the idea of the players crossing their minds.  It is not "a combination
and a form" of words, a set speech or two, a preconcerted theory of a
character, that will do this: but all the persons concerned must have
been present in the poet's imagination, as at a kind of rehearsal; and
whatever would have passed through their minds on the occasion, and have
been observed by others, passed through his, and is made known to the
reader.--I may add in passing, that Shakspeare always gives the best
directions for the costume and carriage of his heroes.  Thus to take one
example, Ophelia gives the following account of Hamlet; and as Ophelia
had seen Hamlet, I should think her word ought to be taken against that
of any modern authority.

          "_Ophelia_.    My lord, as I was reading in my closet,
      Prince Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
      No hat upon his head, his stockings loose,
      Ungartred, and down-gyved to his ancle,
      Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
      And with a look so piteous,
      As if he had been sent from hell
      To speak of horrors, thus he comes before me.
          _Polonius_.    Mad for thy love!
          _Oph_.    My lord, I do not know,
      But truly I do fear it.
          _Pol_.    What said he?
          _Oph_.    He took me by the wrist, and held me hard,
      Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
      And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
      He falls to such perusal of my face,
      As he would draw it: long staid he so;
      At last, a little shaking of my arm,
      And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
      He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound,
      As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,
      And end his being.  That done, he lets me go,
      And with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
      He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
      For out of doors he went without their help,
      And to the last bended their light on me."
                                                _Act. II. Scene 1_.

How after this airy, fantastic idea of irregular grace and bewildered
melancholy any one can play Hamlet, as we have seen it played, with
strut, and stare, and antic right-angled sharp-pointed gestures, it is
difficult to say, unless it be that Hamlet is not bound, by the
prompter's cue, to study the part of Ophelia.  The account of Ophelia's
death begins thus:

      "There is a willow hanging o'er a brook,
      That shows its hoary leaves in the glassy stream."--

Now this is an instance of the same unconscious power of mind which is
as true to nature as itself.  The leaves of the willow are, in fact,
white underneath, and it is this part of them which would appear "hoary"
in the reflection in the brook.  The same sort of intuitive power, the
same faculty of bringing every object in nature, whether present or
absent, before the mind's eye, is observable in the speech of Cleopatra,
when conjecturing what were the employments of Antony in his absence:--
"He's speaking now, or murmuring, where's my serpent of old Nile?" How
fine to make Cleopatra have this consciousness of her own character, and
to make her feel that it is this for which Antony is in love with her!
She says, after the battle of Actium, when Antony has resolved to risk
another fight, "It is my birth-day; I had thought to have held it poor:
but since my lord is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra." What other poet
would have thought of such a casual resource of the imagination, or
would have dared to avail himself of it? The thing happens in the play
as it might have happened in fact.--That which, perhaps, more than any
thing else distinguishes the dramatic productions of Shakspeare from all
others, is this wonderful truth and individuality of conception.  Each of
his characters is as much itself, and as absolutely independent of the
rest, as well as of the author, as if they were living persons, not
fictions of the mind.  The poet may be said, for the time, to identify
himself with the character he wishes to represent, and to pass from one
to another, like the same soul successively animating different bodies.
By an art like that of the ventriloquist, he throws his imagination out
of himself, and makes every word appear to proceed from the mouth of the
person in whose name it is given.  His plays alone are properly
expressions of the passions, not descriptions of them.  His characters
are real beings of flesh and blood; they speak like men, not like
authors.  One might suppose that he had stood by at the time, and
overheard what passed.  As in our dreams we hold conversations with
ourselves, make remarks, or communicate intelligence, and have no idea
of the answer which we shall receive, and which we ourselves make, till
we hear it: so the dialogues in Shakspeare are carried on without any
consciousness of what is to follow, without any appearance of
preparation or premeditation.  The gusts of passion come and go like
sounds of music borne on the wind.  Nothing is made out by formal
inference and analogy, by climax and antithesis: all comes, or seems to
come, immediately from nature.  Each object and circumstance exists in
his mind, as it would have existed in reality: each several train of
thought and feeling goes on of itself, without confusion or effort.  In
the world of his imagination, every thing has a life, a place, and being
of its own!

Chaucer's characters are sufficiently distinct from one another, but
they are too little varied in themselves, too much like identical
propositions.  They are consistent, but uniform; we get no new idea of
them from first to last; they are not placed in different lights, nor
are their subordinate _traits_ brought out in new situations; they are
like portraits or physiognomical studies, with the distinguishing
features marked with inconceivable truth and precision, but that
preserve the same unaltered air and attitude.  Shakspeare's are
historical figures, equally true and correct, but put into action, where
every nerve and muscle is displayed in the struggle with others, with
all the effect of collision and contrast, with every variety of light
and shade.  Chaucer's characters are narrative, Shakspeare's dramatic,
Milton's epic.  That is, Chaucer told only as much of his story as he
pleased, as was required for a particular purpose.  He answered for his
characters himself.  In Shakspeare they are introduced upon the stage,
are liable to be asked all sorts of questions, and are forced to answer
for themselves.  In Chaucer we perceive a fixed essence of character.  In
Shakspeare there is a continual composition and decomposition of its
elements, a fermentation of every particle in the whole mass, by its
alternate affinity or antipathy to other principles which are brought in
contact with it.  Till the experiment is tried, we do not know the
result, the turn which the character will take in its new circumstances.
Milton took only a few simple principles of character, and raised them
to the utmost conceivable grandeur, and refined them from every base
alloy.  His imagination, "nigh sphered in Heaven," claimed kindred only
with what he saw from that height, and could raise to the same elevation
with itself.  He sat retired and kept his state alone, "playing with
wisdom"; while Shakspeare mingled with the crowd, and played the host,
"to make society the sweeter welcome."

The passion in Shakspeare is of the same nature as his delineation of
character.  It is not some one habitual feeling or sentiment preying upon
itself, growing out of itself, and moulding every thing to itself; it is
passion modified by passion, by all the other feelings to which the
individual is liable, and to which others are liable with him; subject
to all the fluctuations of caprice and accident; calling into play all
the resources of the understanding and all the energies of the will;
irritated by obstacles or yielding to them; rising from small beginnings
to its utmost height; now drunk with hope, now stung to madness, now
sunk in despair, now blown to air with a breath, now raging like a
torrent.  The human soul is made the sport of fortune, the prey of
adversity: it is stretched on the wheel of destiny, in restless ecstacy.
The passions are in a state of projection.  Years are melted down to
moments, and every instant teems with fate.  We know the results, we see
the process.  Thus after Iago has been boasting to himself of the effect
of his poisonous suggestions on the mind of Othello, "which, with a
little act upon the blood, will work like mines of sulphur," he adds--

      "Look where he comes! not poppy, nor mandragora,
      Nor all the drowsy syrups of the East,
      Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
      Which thou ow'dst yesterday."--

And he enters at this moment, like the crested serpent, crowned with his
wrongs and raging for revenge! The whole depends upon the turn of a
thought.  A word, a look, blows the spark of jealousy into a flame; and
the explosion is immediate and terrible as a volcano.  The dialogues in
Lear, in Macbeth, that between Brutus and Cassius, and nearly all those
in Shakspeare, where the interest is wrought up to its highest pitch,
afford examples of this dramatic fluctuation of passion.  The interest in
Chaucer is quite different; it is like the course of a river, strong,
and full, and increasing.  In Shakspeare, on the contrary, it is like the
sea, agitated this way and that, and loud-lashed by furious storms;
while in the still pauses of the blast, we distinguish only the cries of
despair, or the silence of death! Milton, on the other hand, takes the
imaginative part of passion--that which remains after the event, which
the mind reposes on when all is over, which looks upon circumstances
from the remotest elevation of thought and fancy, and abstracts them
from the world of action to that of contemplation.  The objects of
dramatic poetry affect us by sympathy, by their nearness to ourselves,
as they take us by surprise, or force us upon action, "while rage with
rage doth sympathise"; the objects of epic poetry affect us through the
medium of the imagination, by magnitude and distance, by their
permanence and universality.  The one fill us with terror and pity, the
other with admiration and delight.  There are certain objects that strike
the imagination, and inspire awe in the very idea of them, independently
of any dramatic interest, that is, of any connection with the
vicissitudes of human life.  For instance, we cannot think of the
pyramids of Egypt, of a Gothic ruin, or an old Roman encampment, without
a certain emotion, a sense of power and sublimity coming over the mind.
The heavenly bodies that hang over our heads wherever we go, and "in
their untroubled element shall shine when we are laid in dust, and all
our cares forgotten," affect us in the same way.  Thus Satan's address to
the Sun has an epic, not a dramatic interest; for though the second
person in the dialogue makes no answer and feels no concern, yet the eye
of that vast luminary is upon him, like the eye of heaven, and seems
conscious of what he says, like an universal presence.  Dramatic poetry
and epic, in their perfection, indeed, approximate to and strengthen one
another.  Dramatic poetry borrows aid from the dignity of persons and
things, as the heroic does from human passion, but in theory they are
distinct.--When Richard II. calls for the looking-glass to contemplate
his faded majesty in it, and bursts into that affecting exclamation:
"Oh, that I were a mockery-king of snow, to melt away before the sun of
Bolingbroke," we have here the utmost force of human passion, combined
with the ideas of regal splendour and fallen power.  When Milton says of
Satan:

               "------His form had not yet lost
      All her original brightness, nor appear'd
      Less than archangel ruin'd, and th' excess
      Of glory obscur'd;"--

the mixture of beauty, of grandeur, and pathos, from the sense of
irreparable loss, of never-ending, unavailing regret, is perfect.

The great fault of a modern school of poetry is, that it is an
experiment to reduce poetry to a mere effusion of natural sensibility;
or what is worse, to divest it both of imaginary splendour and human
passion, to surround the meanest objects with the morbid feelings and
devouring egotism of the writers' own minds.  Milton and Shakspeare did
not so understand poetry.  They gave a more liberal interpretation both
to nature and art.  They did not do all they could to get rid of the one
and the other, to fill up the dreary void with the Moods of their own
Minds.  They owe their power over the human mind to their having had a
deeper sense than others of what was grand in the objects of nature, or
affecting in the events of human life.  But to the men I speak of there
is nothing interesting, nothing heroical, but themselves.  To them the
fall of gods or of great men is the same.  They do not enter into the
feeling.  They cannot understand the terms.  They are even debarred from
the last poor, paltry consolation of an unmanly triumph over fallen
greatness; for their minds reject, with a convulsive effort and
intolerable loathing, the very idea that there ever was, or was thought
to be, any thing superior to themselves.  All that has ever excited the
attention or admiration of the world, they look upon with the most
perfect indifference; and they are surprised to find that the world
repays their indifference with scorn.  "With what measure they mete, it
has been meted to them again."--

Shakespeare's imagination is of the same plastic kind as his
conception of character or passion.  "It glances from heaven to earth,
from earth to heaven." Its movement is rapid and devious.  It unites the
most opposite extremes; or, as Puck says, in boasting of his own feats,
"puts a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes." He seems always
hurrying from his subject, even while describing it; but the stroke,
like the lightning's, is sure as it is sudden.  He takes the widest
possible range, but from that very range he has his choice of the
greatest variety and aptitude of materials.  He brings together images
the most alike, but placed at the greatest distance from each other;
that is, found in circumstances of the greatest dissimilitude.  From the
remoteness of his combinations, and the celerity with which they are
effected, they coalesce the more indissolubly together.  The more the
thoughts are strangers to each other, and the longer they have been kept
asunder, the more intimate does their union seem to become.  Their
felicity is equal to their force.  Their likeness is made more dazzling
by their novelty.  They startle, and take the fancy prisoner in the same
instant.  I will mention one or two which are very striking, and not much
known, out of Troilus and Cressida.  AEneas says to Agamemnon,

      "I ask that I may waken reverence,
      And on the cheek be ready with a blush
      Modest as morning, when she coldly eyes
      The youthful Phoebus."

Ulysses urging Achilles to shew himself in the field, says--

      "No man is the lord of any thing,
      Till he communicate his parts to others:
      Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,
      Till he behold them formed in the applause,
      Where they're extended! which like an arch reverberates
      The voice again, or like a gate of steel,
      Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
      Its figure and its heat."

Patroclus gives the indolent warrior the same advice.

      "Rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
      Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
      And like a dew-drop from the lion's mane
      Be shook to air."

Shakspeare's language and versification are like the rest of him.  He has
a magic power over words: they come winged at his bidding; and seem to
know their places.  They are struck out at a heat, on the spur of the
occasion, and have all the truth and vividness which arise from an
actual impression of the objects.  His epithets and single phrases are
like sparkles, thrown off from an imagination, fired by the whirling
rapidity of its own motion.  His language is hieroglypnical.  It
translates thoughts into visible images.  It abounds in sudden
transitions and elliptical expressions.  This is the source of his mixed
metaphors, which are only abbreviated forms of speech.  These, however,
give no pain from long custom.  They have, in fact, become idioms in the
language.  They are the building, and not the scaffolding to thought.  We
take the meaning and effect of a well-known passage entire, and no more
stop to scan and spell out the particular words and phrases, than the
syllables of which they are composed.  In trying to recollect any other
author, one sometimes stumbles, in case of failure, on a word as good.
In Shakspeare, any other word but the true one, is sure to be wrong.  If
any body, for instance, could not recollect the words of the following
description,

                     "------Light thickens,
      And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood,"

he would be greatly at a loss to substitute others for them equally
expressive of the feeling.  These remarks, however, are strictly
applicable only to the impassioned parts of Shakspeare's language, which
flowed from the warmth and originality of his imagination, and were his
own.  The language used for prose conversation and ordinary business is
sometimes technical, and involved in the affectation of the time.
Compare, for example, Othello's apology to the senate, relating "his
whole course of love," with some of the preceding parts relating to his
appointment, and the official dispatches from Cyprus.  In this respect,
"the business of the state does him offence."--His versification is no
less powerful, sweet, and varied.  It has every occasional excellence, of
sullen intricacy, crabbed and perplexed, or of the smoothest and
loftiest expansion--from the ease and familiarity of measured
conversation to the lyrical sounds

               "------Of ditties highly penned,
      Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
      With ravishing division to her lute."

It is the only blank verse in the language, except Milton's, that for
itself is readable.  It is not stately and uniformly swelling like his,
but varied and broken by the inequalities of the ground it has to pass
over in its uncertain course,

      "And so by many winding nooks it strays,
      With willing sport to the wild ocean."

It remains to speak of the faults of Shakspeare.  They are not so many
or so great as they have been represented; what there are, are chiefly
owing to the following causes:--The universality of his genius was,
perhaps, a disadvantage to his single works; the variety of his
resources, sometimes diverting him from applying them to the most
effectual purposes.  He might be said to combine the powers of AEschylus
and Aristophanes, of Dante and Rabelais, in his own mind.  If he had been
only half what he was, he would perhaps have appeared greater.  The
natural ease and indifference of his temper made him sometimes less
scrupulous than he might have been.  He is relaxed and careless in
critical places; he is in earnest throughout only in Timon, Macbeth, and
Lear.  Again, he had no models of acknowledged excellence constantly in
view to stimulate his efforts, and by all that appears, no love of fame.
He wrote for the "great vulgar and the small," in his time, not for
posterity.  If Queen Elizabeth and the maids of honour laughed heartily
at his worst jokes, and the catcalls in the gallery were silent at his
best passages, he went home satisfied, and slept the next night well.  He
did not trouble himself about Voltaire's criticisms.  He was willing to
take advantage of the ignorance of the age in many things; and if his
plays pleased others, not to quarrel with them himself.  His very
facility of production would make him set less value on his own
excellences, and not care to distinguish nicely between what he did well
or ill.  His blunders in chronology and geography do not amount to above
half a dozen, and they are offences against chronology and geography,
not against poetry.  As to the unities, he was right in setting them at
defiance.  He was fonder of puns than became so great a man.  His
barbarisms were those of his age.  His genius was his own.  He had no
objection to float down with the stream of common taste and opinion: he
rose above it by his own buoyancy, and an impulse which he could not
keep under, in spite of himself or others, and "his delights did shew
most dolphin-like."

He had an equal genius for comedy and tragedy; and his tragedies are
better than his comedies, because tragedy is better than comedy.  His
female characters, which have been found fault with as insipid, are the
finest in the world.  Lastly, Shakspeare was the least of a coxcomb of
any one that ever lived, and much of a gentleman.

Shakspeare discovers in his writings little religious enthusiasm, and
an indifference to personal reputation; he had none of the bigotry of
his age, and his political prejudices were not very strong.  In these
respects, as well as in every other, he formed a direct contrast to
Milton.  Milton's works are a perpetual invocation to the Muses; a hymn
to Fame.  He had his thoughts constantly fixed on the contemplation of
the Hebrew theocracy, and of a perfect commonwealth; and he seized the
pen with a hand just warm from the touch of the ark of faith.  His
religious zeal infused its character into his imagination; so that he
devotes himself with the same sense of duty to the cultivation of his
genius, as he did to the exercise of virtue, or the good of his country.
The spirit of the poet, the patriot, and the prophet, vied with each
other in his breast.  His mind appears to have held equal communion with
the inspired writers, and with the bards and sages of ancient Greece and
Rome;--

      "Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,
      And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old."

He had a high standard, with which he was always comparing himself,
nothing short of which could satisfy his jealous ambition.  He thought of
nobler forms and nobler things than those he found about him.  He lived
apart, in the solitude of his own thoughts, carefully excluding from his
mind whatever might distract its purposes or alloy its purity, or damp
its zeal.  "With darkness and with dangers compassed round," he had the
mighty models of antiquity always present to his thoughts, and
determined to raise a monument of equal height and glory, "piling up
every stone of lustre from the brook," for the delight and wonder of
posterity.  He had girded himself up, and as it were, sanctified his
genius to this service from his youth.  "For after," he says, "I had from
my first years, by the ceaseless diligence and care of my father, been
exercised to the tongues, and some sciences as my age could suffer, by
sundry masters and teachers, it was found that whether aught was imposed
upon me by them, or betaken to of my own choice, the style by certain
vital signs it had, was likely to live; but much latelier, in the
private academies of Italy, perceiving that some trifles which I had in
memory, composed at under twenty or thereabout, met with acceptance
above what was looked for; I began thus far to assent both to them and
divers of my friends here at home, and not less to an inward prompting
which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intense study (which I
take to be my portion in this life), joined with the strong propensity
of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written to after-times as
they should not willingly let it die.  The accomplishment of these
intentions, which have lived within me ever since I could conceive
myself anything worth to my country, lies not but in a power above man's
to promise; but that none hath by more studious ways endeavoured, and
with more unwearied spirit that none shall, that I dare almost aver of
myself, as far as life and free leisure will extend.  Neither do I think
it shame to covenant with any knowing reader, that for some few years
yet, I may go on trust with him toward the payment of what I am now
indebted, as being a work not to be raised from the heat of youth or the
vapours of wine; like that which flows at waste from the pen of some
vulgar amourist, or the trencher fury of a rhyming parasite, nor to be
obtained by the invocation of Dame Memory and her Siren daughters, but
by devout prayer to that eternal spirit who can enrich with all
utterance and knowledge, and sends out his Seraphim with the hallowed
fire of his altar, to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases: to
this must be added industrious and select reading, steady observation,
and insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs.  Although it
nothing content me to have disclosed thus much beforehand; but that I
trust hereby to make it manifest with what small willingness I endure to
interrupt the pursuit of no less hopes than these, and leave a calm and
pleasing solitariness, fed with cheerful and confident thoughts, to
embark in a troubled sea of noises and hoarse disputes, from beholding
the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful
studies."

So that of Spenser:

      "The noble heart that harbours virtuous thought,
        And is with child of glorious great intent,
      Can never rest until it forth have brought
        The eternal brood of glory excellent."

Milton, therefore, did not write from casual impulse, but after a
severe examination of his own strength, and with a resolution to leave
nothing undone which it was in his power to do.  He always labours, and
almost always succeeds.  He strives hard to say the finest things in the
world, and he does say them.  He adorns and dignifies his subject to the
utmost: he surrounds it with every possible association of beauty or
grandeur, whether moral, intellectual, or physical.  He refines on his
descriptions of beauty; loading sweets on sweets, till the sense aches
at them; and raises his images of terror to a gigantic elevation, that
"makes Ossa like a wart." In Milton, there is always an appearance of
effort: in Shakespeare, scarcely any.

Milton has borrowed more than any other writer, and exhausted every
source of imitation, sacred or profane; yet he is perfectly distinct
from every other writer.  He is a writer of centos, and yet in
originality scarcely inferior to Homer.  The power of his mind is stamped
on every line.  The fervour of his imagination melts down and renders
malleable, as in a furnace, the most contradictory materials.  In reading
his works, we feel ourselves under the influence of a mighty intellect,
that the nearer it approaches to others, becomes more distinct from
them.  The quantity of art in him shews the strength of his genius: the
weight of his intellectual obligations would have oppressed any other
writer.  Milton's learning has the effect of intuition.  He describes
objects, of which he could only have read in books, with the vividness
of actual observation.  His imagination has the force of nature.  He makes
words tell as pictures.

      "Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat
      Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks
      Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams."

The word _lucid_ here gives to the idea all the sparkling effect of the
most perfect landscape.

And again:

      "As when a vulture on Imaus bred,
      Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
      Dislodging from a region scarce of prey,
      To gorge the flesh of lambs and yeanling kids
      On hills where flocks are fed, flies towards the springs
      Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
      But in his way lights on the barren plains
      Of Sericana, where Chineses [sic] drive
      With sails and wind their cany waggons light."

If Milton had taken a journey for the express purpose, he could not have
described this scenery and mode of life better.  Such passages are like
demonstrations of natural history.  Instances might be multiplied without
end.

We might be tempted to suppose that the vividness with which he
describes visible objects, was owing to their having acquired an unusual
degree of strength in his mind, after the privation of his sight; but we
find the same palpableness and truth in the descriptions which occur in
his early poems.  In Lycidas he speaks of "the great vision of the
guarded mount," with that preternatural weight of impression with which
it would present itself suddenly to "the pilot of some small
night-foundered skiff": and the lines in the Penseroso, describing "the
wandering moon,"

      "Riding near her highest noon,
      Like one that had been led astray
      Through the heaven's wide pathless way,"

are as if he had gazed himself blind in looking at her.  There is also
the same depth of impression in his descriptions of the objects of all
the different senses, whether colours, or sounds, or smells--the same
absorption of his mind in whatever engaged his attention at the time.  It
has been indeed objected to Milton, by a common perversity of criticism,
that his ideas were musical rather than picturesque, as if because they
were in the highest degree musical, they must be (to keep the sage
critical balance even, and to allow no one man to possess two qualities
at the same time) proportionably deficient in other respects.  But
Milton's poetry is not cast in any such narrow, common-place mould; it
is not so barren of resources.  His worship of the Muse was not so simple
or confined.  A sound arises "like a steam of rich distilled perfumes";
we hear the pealing organ, but the incense on the altars is also there,
and the statues of the gods are ranged around! The ear indeed
predominates over the eye, because it is more immediately affected, and
because the language of music blends more immediately with, and forms a
more natural accompaniment to, the variable and indefinite associations
of ideas conveyed by words.  But where the associations of the
imagination are not the principal thing, the individual object is given
by Milton with equal force and beauty.  The strongest and best proof of
this, as a characteristic power of his mind, is, that the persons of
Adam and Eve, of Satan, &c. are always accompanied, in our imagination,
with the grandeur of the naked figure; they convey to us the ideas of
sculpture.  As an instance, take the following:

                   "------He soon
      Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
      The same whom John saw also in the sun:
      His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
      Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
      Circled his head, nor less his locks behind
      Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
      Lay waving round; on some great charge employ'd
      He seem'd, or fix'd in cogitation deep.
      Glad was the spirit impure, as now in hope
      To find who might direct his wand'ring flight
      To Paradise, the happy seat of man,
      His journey's end, and our beginning woe.
      But first he casts to change his proper shape,
      Which else might work him danger or delay:
      And now a stripling cherub he appears,
      Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
      Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb
      Suitable grace diffus'd, so well he feign'd:
      Under a coronet his flowing hair
      In curls on either cheek play'd; wings he wore
      Of many a colour'd plume sprinkled with gold,
      His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
      Before his decent steps a silver wand."

The figures introduced here have all the elegance and precision of a
Greek statue; glossy and impurpled, tinged with golden light, and
musical as the strings of Memnon's harp!

Again, nothing can be more magnificent than the portrait of
Beelzebub:

      "With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
      The weight of mightiest monarchies:"

Or the comparison of Satan, as he "lay floating many a rood," to "that
sea beast,"

      "Leviathan, which God of all his works
      Created hugest that swim the ocean-stream!"

What a force of imagination is there in this last expression! What an
idea it conveys of the size of that hugest of created beings, as if it
shrunk up the ocean to a stream, and took up the sea in its nostrils as
a very little thing? Force of style is one of Milton's greatest
excellences.  Hence, perhaps, he stimulates us more in the reading, and
less afterwards.  The way to defend Milton against all impugners, is to
take down the book and read it.

Milton's blank verse is the only blank verse in the language (except
Shakspeare's) that deserves the name of verse.  Dr. Johnson, who had
modelled his ideas of versification on the regular sing-song of Pope,
condemns the Paradise Lost as harsh and unequal.  I shall not pretend to
say that this is not sometimes the case; for where a degree of
excellence beyond the mechanical rules of art is attempted, the poet
must sometimes fail.  But I imagine that there are more perfect examples
in Milton of musical expression, or of an adaptation of the sound and
movement of the verse to the meaning of the passage, than in all our
other writers, whether of rhyme or blank verse, put together, (with the
exception already mentioned).  Spenser is the most harmonious of our
stanza writers, as Dryden is the most sounding and varied of our
rhymists.  But in neither is there any thing like the same ear for music,
the same power of approximating the varieties of poetical to those of
musical rhythm, as there is in our great epic poet.  The sound of his
lines is moulded into the expression of the sentiment, almost of the
very image.  They rise or fall, pause or hurry rapidly on, with exquisite
art, but without the least trick or affectation, as the occasion seems
to require.

The following are some of the finest instances:

                   "------His hand was known
      In Heaven by many a tower'd structure high;--
      Nor was his name unheard or unador'd
      In ancient Greece: and in the Ausonian land
      Men called him Mulciber: and how he fell
      From Heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
      Sheer o'er the chrystal battlements; from morn
      To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,
      A summer's day; and with the setting sun
      Dropt from the zenith like a falling star
      On Lemnos, the AEgean isle: thus they relate,
      Erring."--

            "------But chief the spacious hall
      Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,
      Brush'd with the hiss of rustling wings.  As bees
      In spring time, when the sun with Taurus rides,
      Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
      In clusters; they among fresh dews and flow'rs
      Fly to and fro: or on the smoothed plank,
      The suburb of their straw-built citadel,
      New rubb'd with balm, expatiate and confer
      Their state affairs.  So thick the airy crowd
      Swarm'd and were straiten'd; till the signal giv'n,
      Behold a wonder!  They but now who seem'd
      In bigness to surpass earth's giant sons,
      Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room
      Throng numberless, like that Pygmean race
      Beyond the Indian mount, or fairy elves,
      Whose midnight revels by a forest side
      Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,
      Or dreams he sees, while over-head the moon
      Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth
      Wheels her pale course: they on their mirth and dance
      Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;
      At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds."

I can only give another instance, though I have some difficulty in
leaving off.

      "Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood
      So high above the circling canopy
      Of night's extended shade) from th' eastern point
      Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
      Andromeda far off Atlantic seas
      Beyond the horizon: then from pole to pole
      He views in breadth, and without longer pause
      Down right into the world's first region throws
      His flight precipitant, and winds with ease
      Through the pure marble air his oblique way
      Amongst innumerable stars that shone
      Stars distant, but nigh hand seem'd other worlds;
      Or other worlds they seem'd or happy isles," &c.

The verse, in this exquisitely modulated passage, floats up and down as
if it had itself wings.  Milton has himself given us the theory of his
versification--

      "Such as the meeting soul may pierce
      In notes with many a winding bout
      Of linked sweetness long drawn out."

Dr. Johnson and Pope would have converted his vaulting Pegasus into a
rocking-horse.  Read any other blank verse but Milton's,--Thomson's,
Young's, Cowper's, Wordsworth's,--and it will be found, from the want
of the same insight into "the hidden soul of harmony," to be mere
lumbering prose.

To proceed to a consideration of the merits of Paradise Lost, in the
most essential point of view, I mean as to the poetry of character and
passion.  I shall say nothing of the fable, or of other technical
objections or excellences; but I shall try to explain at once the
foundation of the interest belonging to the poem.  I am ready to give up
the dialogues in Heaven, where, as Pope justly observes, "God the Father
turns a school-divine"; nor do I consider the battle of the angels as
the climax of sublimity, or the most successful effort of Milton's pen.
In a word, the interest of the poem arises from the daring ambition and
fierce passions of Satan, and from the account of the paradisaical
happiness, and the loss of it by our first parents.  Three-fourths of the
work are taken up with these characters, and nearly all that relates to
them is unmixed sublimity and beauty.  The two first books alone are like
two massy pillars of solid gold.

Satan is the most heroic subject that ever was chosen for a poem; and
the execution is as perfect as the design is lofty.  He was the first of
created beings, who, for endeavouring to be equal with the highest, and
to divide the empire of heaven with the Almighty, was hurled down to
hell.  His aim was no less than the throne of the universe; his means,
myriads of angelic armies bright, the third part of the heavens, whom he
lured after him with his countenance, and who durst defy the Omnipotent
in arms.  His ambition was the greatest, and his punishment was the
greatest; but not so his despair, for his fortitude was as great as his
sufferings.  His strength of mind was matchless as his strength of body;
the vastness of his designs did not surpass the firm, inflexible
determination with which he submitted to his irreversible doom, and
final loss of all good.  His power of action and of suffering was equal.
He was the greatest power that was ever overthrown, with the strongest
will left to resist or to endure.  He was baffled, not confounded.  He
stood like a tower; or

                       "------As when Heaven's fire
      Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines."

He was still surrounded with hosts of rebel angels, armed warriors, who
own him as their sovereign leader, and with whose fate he sympathises as
he views them round, far as the eye can reach; though he keeps aloof
from them in his own mind, and holds supreme counsel only with his own
breast.  An outcast from Heaven, Hell trembles beneath his feet, Sin and
Death are at his heels, and mankind are his easy prey.

      "All is not lost; th' unconquerable will,
      And study of revenge, immortal hate,
      And courage never to submit or yield,
      And what else is not to be overcome,"

are still his.  The sense of his punishment seems lost in the magnitude
of it; the fierceness of tormenting flames is qualified and made
innoxious by the greater fierceness of his pride; the loss of infinite
happiness to himself is compensated in thought, by the power of
inflicting infinite misery on others.  Yet Satan is not the principle of
malignity, or of the abstract love of evil--but of the abstract love
of power, of pride, of self-will personified, to which last principle
all other good and evil, and even his own, are subordinate.  From this
principle he never once flinches.  His love of power and contempt for
suffering are never once relaxed from the highest pitch of intensity.
His thoughts burn like a hell within him; but the power of thought holds
dominion in his mind over every other consideration.  The consciousness
of a determined purpose, of "that intellectual being, those thoughts
that wander through eternity," though accompanied with endless pain, he
prefers to nonentity, to "being swallowed up and lost in the wide womb
of uncreated night." He expresses the sum and substance of all ambition
in one line.  "Fallen cherub, to be weak is miserable, doing or
suffering!" After such a conflict as his, and such a defeat, to retreat
in order, to rally, to make terms, to exist at all, is something; but he
does more than this--he founds a new empire in hell, and from it
conquers this new world, whither he bends his undaunted flight, forcing
his way through nether and surrounding fires.  The poet has not in all
this given us a mere shadowy outline; the strength is equal to the
magnitude of the conception.  The Achilles of Homer is not more distinct;
the Titans were not more vast; Prometheus chained to his rock was not a
more terrific example of suffering and of crime.  Wherever the figure of
Satan is introduced, whether he walks or flies, "rising aloft incumbent
on the dusky air," it is illustrated with the most striking and
appropriate images: so that we see it always before us, gigantic,
irregular, portentous, uneasy, and disturbed--but dazzling in its
faded splendour, the clouded ruins of a god.  The deformity of Satan is
only in the depravity of his will; he has no bodily deformity to excite
our loathing or disgust.  The horns and tail are not there, poor emblems
of the unbending, unconquered spirit, of the writhing agonies within.
Milton was too magnanimous and open an antagonist to support his
argument by the bye-tricks of a hump and cloven foot; to bring into the
fair field of controversy the good old catholic prejudices of which
Tasso and Dante have availed themselves, and which the mystic German
critics would restore.  He relied on the justice of his cause, and did
not scruple to give the devil his due.  Some persons may think that he
has carried his liberality too far, and injured the cause he professed
to espouse by making him the chief person in his poem.  Considering the
nature of his subject, he would be equally in danger of running into
this fault, from his faith in religion, and his love of rebellion; and
perhaps each of these motives had its full share in determining the
choice of his subject.

Not only the figure of Satan, but his speeches in council, his
soliloquies, his address to Eve, his share in the war in heaven, or in
the fall of man, shew the same decided superiority of character.  To give
only one instance, almost the first speech he makes:

      "Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,
      Said then the lost archangel, this the seat
      That we must change for Heaven; this mournful gloom
      For that celestial light?  Be it so, since he
      Who now is sov'rain can dispose and bid
      What shall be right: farthest from him is best,
      Whom reason hath equal'd, force hath made supreme
      Above his equals.  Farewel happy fields,
      Where joy for ever dwells: Hail horrors, hail
      Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell,
      Receive thy new possessor: one who brings
      A mind not to be chang'd by place or time.
      The mind is its own place, and in itself
      Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
      What matter where, if I be still the same,
      And what I should be, all but less than he
      Whom thunder hath made greater?  Here at least
      We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
      Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
      Here we may reign secure, and in my choice
      To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
      Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven."

The whole of the speeches and debates in Pandemonium are well worthy
of the place and the occasion--with Gods for speakers, and angels and
archangels for hearers.  There is a decided manly tone in the arguments
and sentiments, an eloquent dogmatism, as if each person spoke from
thorough conviction; an excellence which Milton probably borrowed from
his spirit of partisanship, or else his spirit of partisanship from the
natural firmness and vigour of his mind.  In this respect Milton
resembles Dante, (the only modern writer with whom he has any thing in
common) and it is remarkable that Dante, as well as Milton, was a
political partisan.  That approximation to the severity of impassioned
prose which has been made an objection to Milton's poetry, and which is
chiefly to be met with in these bitter invectives, is one of its great
excellences.  The author might here turn his philippics against Salmasius
to good account.  The rout in Heaven is like the fall of some mighty
structure, nodding to its base, "with hideous ruin and combustion down."
But, perhaps, of all the passages in Paradise Lost, the description of
the employments of the angels during the absence of Satan, some of whom
"retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp
their own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battle," is the most
perfect example of mingled pathos and sublimity.--What proves the truth
of this noble picture in every part, and that the frequent complaint of
want of interest in it is the fault of the reader, not of the poet, is
that when any interest of a practical kind take a shape that can be at
all turned into this, (and there is little doubt that Milton had some
such in his eye in writing it,) each party converts it to its own
purposes, feels the absolute identity of these abstracted and high
speculations; and that, in fact, a noted political writer of the present
day has exhausted nearly the whole account of Satan in the Paradise
Lost, by applying it to a character whom he considered as after the
devil, (though I do not know whether he would make even that exception)
the greatest enemy of the human race.  This may serve to shew that
Milton's Satan is not a very insipid personage.

Of Adam and Eve it has been said, that the ordinary reader can feel
little interest in them, because they have none of the passions,
pursuits, or even relations of human life, except that of man and wife,
the least interesting of all others, if not to the parties concerned, at
least to the by-standers.  The preference has on this account been given
to Homer, who, it is said, has left very vivid and infinitely
diversified pictures of all the passions and affections, public and
private, incident to human nature--the relations of son, of brother,
parent, friend, citizen, and many others.  Longinus preferred the Iliad
to the Odyssey, on account of the greater number of battles it contains;
but I can neither agree to his criticism, nor assent to the present
objection.  It is true, there is little action in this part of Milton's
poem; but there is much repose, and more enjoyment.  There are none of
the every-day occurrences, contentions, disputes, wars, fightings,
feuds, jealousies, trades, professions, liveries, and common handicrafts
of life; "no kind of traffic; letters are not known; no use of service,
of riches, poverty, contract, succession, bourne, bound of land, tilth,
vineyard none; no occupation, no treason, felony, sword, pike, knife,
gun, nor need of any engine." So much the better; thank Heaven, all
these were yet to come.  But still the die was cast, and in them our doom
was sealed.  In them

      "The generations were prepared; the pangs,
      The internal pangs, were ready, the dread strife
      Of poor humanity's afflicted will,
      Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny."

In their first false step we trace all our future woe, with loss of
Eden.  But there was a short and precious interval between, like the
first blush of morning before the day is overcast with tempest, the dawn
of the world, the birth of nature from "the unapparent deep," with its
first dews and freshness on its cheek, breathing odours.  Theirs was the
first delicious taste of life, and on them depended all that was to come
of it.  In them hung trembling all our hopes and fears.  They were as yet
alone in the world, in the eye of nature, wondering at their new being,
full of enjoyment and enraptured with one another, with the voice of
their Maker walking in the garden, and ministering angels attendant on
their steps, winged messengers from heaven like rosy clouds descending
in their sight.  Nature played around them her virgin fancies wild; and
spread for them a repast where no crude surfeit reigned.  Was there
nothing in this scene, which God and nature alone witnessed, to interest
a modern critic? What need was there of action, where the heart was full
of bliss and innocence without it! They had nothing to do but feel their
own happiness, and "know to know no more."  "They toiled not, neither
did they spin; yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these." All things seem to acquire fresh sweetness, and to be clothed
with fresh beauty in their sight.  They tasted as it were for themselves
and us, of all that there ever was pure in human bliss.  "In them the
burthen of the mystery, the heavy and the weary weight of all this
unintelligible world, is lightened." They stood awhile perfect, but they
afterwards fell, and were driven out of Paradise, tasting the first
fruits of bitterness as they had done of bliss.  But their pangs were
such as a pure spirit might feel at the sight--their tears "such as
angels weep." The pathos is of that mild contemplative kind which arises
from regret for the loss of unspeakable happiness, and resignation to
inevitable fate.  There is none of the fierceness of intemperate passion,
none of the agony of mind and turbulence of action, which is the result
of the habitual struggles of the will with circumstances, irritated by
repeated disappointment, and constantly setting its desires most eagerly
on that which there is an impossibility of attaining.  This would have
destroyed the beauty of the whole picture.  They had received their
unlooked-for happiness as a free gift from their Creator's hands, and
they submitted to its loss, not without sorrow, but without impious and
stubborn repining.

      "In either hand the hast'ning angel caught
      Our ling'ring parents, and to th' eastern gate
      Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast
      To the subjected plain; then disappear'd.
      They looking back, all th' eastern side beheld
      Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
      Wav'd over by that flaming brand, the gate
      With dreadful faces throng'd, and fiery arms:
      Some natural tears they dropt, but wip'd them soon;
      The world was all before them, where to choose
      Their place of rest, and Providence their guide."




LECTURE IV.
ON DRYDEN AND POPE.


Dryden and Pope are the great masters of the artificial style of
poetry in our language, as the poets of whom I have already treated,
Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, and Milton, were of the natural; and
though this artificial style is generally and very justly acknowledged
to be inferior to the other, yet those who stand at the head of that
class, ought, perhaps, to rank higher than those who occupy an inferior
place in a superior class.  They have a clear and independent claim upon
our gratitude, as having produced a kind and degree of excellence which
existed equally nowhere else.  What has been done well by some later
writers of the highest style of poetry, is included in, and obscured by
a greater degree of power and genius in those before them: what has been
done best by poets of an entirely distinct turn of mind, stands by
itself, and tells for its whole amount.  Young, for instance, Gray, or
Akenside, only follow in the train of Milton and Shakspeare: Pope and
Dryden walk by their side, though of an unequal stature, and are
entitled to a first place in the lists of fame.  This seems to be not
only the reason of the thing, but the common sense of mankind, who,
without any regular process of reflection, judge of the merit of a work,
not more by its inherent and absolute worth, than by its originality and
capacity of gratifying a different faculty of the mind, or a different
class of readers; for it should be recollected, that there may be
readers (as well as poets) not of the highest class, though very good
sort of people, and not altogether to be despised.

The question, whether Pope was a poet, has hardly yet been settled,
and is hardly worth settling; for if he was not a great poet, he must
have been a great prose-writer, that is, he was a great writer of some
sort.  He was a man of exquisite faculties, and of the most refined
taste; and as he chose verse (the most obvious distinction of poetry) as
the vehicle to express his ideas, he has generally passed for a poet,
and a good one.  If, indeed, by a great poet, we mean one who gives the
utmost grandeur to our conceptions of nature, or the utmost force to the
passions of the heart, Pope was not in this sense a great poet; for the
bent, the characteristic power of his mind, lay the clean contrary way;
namely, in representing things as they appear to the indifferent
observer, stripped of prejudice and passion, as in his Critical Essays;
or in representing them in the most contemptible and insignificant point
of view, as in his Satires; or in clothing the little with mock-dignity,
as in his poems of Fancy; or in adorning the trivial incidents and
familiar relations of life with the utmost elegance of expression, and
all the flattering illusions of friendship or self-love, as in his
Epistles.  He was not then distinguished as a poet of lofty enthusiasm,
of strong imagination, with a passionate sense of the beauties of
nature, or a deep insight into the workings of the heart; but he was a
wit, and a critic, a man of sense, of observation, and the world, with a
keen relish for the elegances of art, or of nature when embellished by
art, a quick tact for propriety of thought and manners as established by
the forms and customs of society, a refined sympathy with the sentiments
and habitudes of human life, as he felt them within the little circle of
his family and friends.  He was, in a word, the poet, not of nature, but
of art; and the distinction between the two, as well as I can make it
out, is this--The poet of nature is one who, from the elements of
beauty, of power, and of passion in his own breast, sympathises with
whatever is beautiful, and grand, and impassioned in nature, in its
simple majesty, in its immediate appeal to the senses, to the thoughts
and hearts of all men; so that the poet of nature, by the truth, and
depth, and harmony of his mind, may be said to hold communion with the
very soul of nature; to be identified with and to foreknow and to record
the feelings of all men at all times and places, as they are liable to
the same impressions; and to exert the same power over the minds of his
readers, that nature does.  He sees things in their eternal beauty, for
he sees them as they are; he feels them in their universal interest, for
he feels them as they affect the first principles of his and our common
nature.  Such was Homer, such was Shakspeare, whose works will last as
long as nature, because they are a copy of the indestructible forms and
everlasting impulses of nature, welling out from the bosom as from a
perennial spring, or stamped upon the senses by the hand of their maker.
The power of the imagination in them, is the representative power of all
nature.  It has its centre in the human soul, and makes the circuit of
the universe.

Pope was not assuredly a poet of this class, or in the first rank of
it.  He saw nature only dressed by art; he judged of beauty by fashion;
he sought for truth in the opinions of the world; he judged of the
feelings of others by his own.  The capacious soul of Shakspeare had an
intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could enter into the heart
of man in all possible circumstances: Pope had an exact knowledge of all
that he himself loved or hated, wished or wanted.  Milton has winged his
daring flight from heaven to earth, through Chaos and old Night.  Pope's
Muse never wandered with safety, but from his library to his grotto, or
from his grotto into his library back again.  His mind dwelt with greater
pleasure on his own garden, than on the garden of Eden; he could
describe the faultless whole-length mirror that reflected his own
person, better than the smooth surface of the lake that reflects the
face of heaven--a piece of cut glass or a pair of paste buckles with
more brilliance and effect, than a thousand dew-drops glittering in the
sun.  He would be more delighted with a patent lamp, than with "the pale
reflex of Cynthia's brow," that fills the skies with its soft silent
lustre, that trembles through the cottage window, and cheers the
watchful mariner on the lonely wave.  In short, he was the poet of
personality and of polished life.  That which was nearest to him, was the
greatest; the fashion of the day bore sway in his mind over the
immutable laws of nature.  He preferred the artificial to the natural in
external objects, because he had a stronger fellow-feeling with the
self-love of the maker or proprietor of a gewgaw, than admiration of
that which was interesting to all mankind.  He preferred the artificial
to the natural in passion, because the involuntary and uncalculating
impulses of the one hurried him away with a force and vehemence with
which he could not grapple; while he could trifle with the conventional
and superficial modifications of mere sentiment at will, laugh at or
admire, put them on or off like a masquerade-dress, make much or little
of them, indulge them for a longer or a shorter time, as he pleased; and
because while they amused his fancy and exercised his ingenuity, they
never once disturbed his vanity, his levity, or indifference.  His mind
was the antithesis of strength and grandeur; its power was the power of
indifference.  He had none of the enthusiasm of poetry; he was in poetry
what the sceptic is in religion.

It cannot be denied, that his chief excellence lay more in
diminishing, than in aggrandizing objects; in checking, not in
encouraging our enthusiasm; in sneering at the extravagances of fancy or
passion, instead of giving a loose to them; in describing a row of pins
and needles, rather than the embattled spears of Greeks and Trojans; in
penning a lampoon or a compliment, and in praising Martha Blount.

Shakspeare says,

         "------In Fortune's ray and brightness
      The herd hath more annoyance by the brize
      Than by the tyger: but when the splitting wind
      Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
      And flies fled under shade, why then
      The thing of courage,
      As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathise;
      And with an accent tuned in the self-same key,
      Replies to chiding Fortune."

There is none of this rough work in Pope.  His Muse was on a
peace-establishment, and grew somewhat effeminate by long ease and
indulgence.  He lived in the smiles of fortune, and basked in the favour
of the great.  In his smooth and polished verse we meet with no prodigies
of nature, but with miracles of wit; the thunders of his pen are
whispered flatteries; its forked lightnings pointed sarcasms; for "the
gnarled oak," he gives us "the soft myrtle": for rocks, and seas, and
mountains, artificial grass-plats, gravel-walks, and tinkling rills; for
earthquakes and tempests, the breaking of a flower-pot, or the fall of a
china jar; for the tug and war of the elements, or the deadly strife of
the passions, we have

      "Calm contemplation and poetic ease."

Yet within this retired and narrow circle how much, and that how
exquisite, was contained! What discrimination, what wit, what delicacy,
what fancy, what lurking spleen, what elegance of thought, what pampered
refinement of sentiment! It is like looking at the world through a
microscope, where every thing assumes a new character and a new
consequence, where things are seen in their minutest circumstances and
slightest shades of difference; where the little becomes gigantic, the
deformed beautiful, and the beautiful deformed.  The wrong end of the
magnifier is, to be sure, held to every thing, but still the exhibition
is highly curious, and we know not whether to be most pleased or
surprised.  Such, at least, is the best account I am able to give of this
extraordinary man, without doing injustice to him or others.  It is time
to refer to particular instances in his works.--The Rape of the Lock is
the best or most ingenious of these.  It is the most exquisite specimen
of _fillagree_ work ever invented.  It is admirable in proportion as it
is made of nothing.

      "More subtle web Arachne cannot spin,
      Nor the fine nets, which oft we woven see
      Of scorched dew, do not in th' air more lightly flee."

It is made of gauze and silver spangles.  The most glittering appearance
is given to every thing, to paste, pomatum, billet-doux, and patches.
Airs, languid airs, breathe around;--the atmosphere is perfumed with
affectation.  A toilette is described with the solemnity of an altar
raised to the Goddess of vanity, and the history of a silver bodkin is
given with all the pomp of heraldry.  No pains are spared, no profusion
of ornament, no splendour of poetic diction, to set off the meanest
things.  The balance between the concealed irony and the assumed gravity,
is as nicely trimmed as the balance of power in Europe.  The little is
made great, and the great little.  You hardly know whether to laugh or
weep.  It is the triumph of insignificance, the apotheosis of foppery and
folly.  It is the perfection of the mock-heroic! I will give only the two
following passages in illustration of these remarks.  Can any thing be
more elegant and graceful than the description of Belinda, in the
beginning of the second canto?

        "Not with more glories, in the ethereal plain,
      The sun first rises o'er the purpled main,
      Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams
      Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames.
      Fair nymphs, and well-drest youths around her shone,
      But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.
      On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,
      Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.
      Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,
      Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:
      Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;
      Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
      Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike;
      And like the sun, they shine on all alike.
      Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,
      Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:
      If to her share some female errors fall,
      Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.

        This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,
      Nourish'd two locks, which graceful hung behind
      In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck
      With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck."

The following is the introduction to the account of Belinda's assault
upon the baron bold, who had dissevered one of these locks "from her
fair head for ever and for ever."

        "Now meet thy fate, incens'd Belinda cry'd,
      And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.
      (The same his ancient personage to deck,
      Her great, great grandsire wore about his neck,
      In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,
      Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:
      Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,
      The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;
      Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs,
      Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears)."

I do not know how far Pope was indebted for the original idea, or the
delightful execution of this poem, to the Lutrin of Boileau.

The Rape of the Lock is a double-refined essence of wit and fancy, as
the Essay on Criticism is of wit and sense.  The quantity of thought and
observation in this work, for so young a man as Pope was when he wrote
it, is wonderful: unless we adopt the supposition, that most men of
genius spend the rest of their lives in teaching others what they
themselves have learned under twenty.  The conciseness and felicity of
the expression are equally remarkable.  Thus in reasoning on the variety
of men's opinion, he says--

      " 'Tis with our judgments, as our watches; none
      Go just alike, yet each believes his own."

Nothing can be more original and happy than the general remarks and
illustrations in the Essay; the critical rules laid down are too much
those of a school, and of a confined one.  There is one passage in the
Essay on Criticism in which the author speaks with that eloquent
enthusiasm of the fame of ancient writers, which those will always feel
who have themselves any hope or chance of immortality.  I have quoted the
passage elsewhere, but I will repeat it here.

      "Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,
      Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;
      Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,
      Destructive war, and all-involving age.
      Hail, bards triumphant, born in happier days,
      Immortal heirs of universal praise!
      Whose honours with increase of ages grow,
      As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow."

These lines come with double force and beauty on the reader, as they
were dictated by the writer's despair of ever attaining that lasting
glory which he celebrates with such disinterested enthusiasm in others,
from the lateness of the age in which he lived, and from his writing in
a tongue, not understood by other nations, and that grows obsolete and
unintelligible to ourselves at the end of every second century.  But he
needed not have thus antedated his own poetical doom--the loss and
entire oblivion of that which can never die.  If he had known, he might
have boasted that "his little bark" wafted down the stream of time,

               "------With _theirs_ should sail,
      Pursue the triumph and partake the gale"--

if those who know how to set a due value on the blessing, were not the
last to decide confidently on their own pretensions to it.

There is a cant in the present day about genius, as every thing in
poetry: there was a cant in the time of Pope about sense, as performing
all sorts of wonders.  It was a kind of watchword, the shibboleth of a
critical party of the day.  As a proof of the exclusive attention which
it occupied in their minds, it is remarkable that in the Essay on
Criticism (not a very long poem) there are no less than half a score
successive couplets rhyming to the word _sense_.  This appears almost
incredible without giving the instances, and no less so when they are
given.

      "But of the two, less dangerous is the offence,
      To tire our patience than mislead our sense."--_lines_ 3, 4.

      "In search of wit these lose their common sense,
      And then turn critics in their own defence."--_l._ 28, 29.

      "Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,
      And fills up all the mighty void of sense."--_l._ 209, 10.

      "Some by old words to fame have made pretence,
      Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense."--_l._ 324, 5.

      " 'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence;
      The sound must seem an echo to the sense."--_l._ 364, 5.

      "At every trifle scorn to take offence;
      That always shews great pride, or little sense."--_l._ 386, 7.

      "Be silent always, when you doubt your sense,
      And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence."--_l._ 366, 7.

      "Be niggards of advice on no pretence,
      For the worst avarice is that of sense."--_l._ 578, 9.

      "Strain out the last dull dropping of their sense,
      And rhyme with all the rage of impotence."--_l._ 608, 9.

      "Horace still charms with graceful negligence,
      And without method talks us into sense."--_l._ 653, 4.

I have mentioned this the more for the sake of those critics who are
bigotted idolisers of our author, chiefly on the score of his
correctness.  These persons seem to be of opinion that "there is but one
perfect writer, even Pope." This is, however, a mistake: his excellence
is by no means faultlessness.  If he had no great faults, he is full of
little errors.  His grammatical construction is often lame and imperfect.
In the Abelard and Eloise, he says--

      "There died the best of passions, Love and Fame."

This is not a legitimate ellipsis.  Fame is not a passion, though love
is: but his ear was evidently confused by the meeting of the sounds
"love and fame," as if they of themselves immediately implied "love, and
love of fame." Pope's rhymes are constantly defective, being rhymes to
the eye instead of the ear; and this to a greater degree, not only than
in later, but than in preceding writers.  The praise of his versification
must be confined to its uniform smoothness and harmony.  In the
translation of the Iliad, which has been considered as his masterpiece
in style and execution, he continually changes the tenses in the same
sentence for the purposes of the rhyme, which shews either a want of
technical resources, or great inattention to punctilious exactness.  But
to have done with this.

The epistle of Eloise to Abelard is the only exception I can think
of, to the general spirit of the foregoing remarks; and I should be
disingenuous not to acknowledge that it is an exception.  The foundation
is in the letters themselves of Abelard and Eloise, which are quite as
impressive, but still in a different way.  It is fine as a poem: it is
finer as a piece of high-wrought eloquence.  No woman could be supposed
to write a better love-letter in verse.  Besides the richness of the
historical materials, the high _gusto_ of the original sentiments which
Pope had to work upon, there were perhaps circumstances in his own
situation which made him enter into the subject with even more than a
poet's feeling.  The tears shed are drops gushing from the heart: the
words are burning sighs breathed from the soul of love.  Perhaps the poem
to which it bears the greatest similarity in our language, is Dryden's
Tancred and Sigismunda, taken from Boccaccio.  Pope's Eloise will bear
this comparison; and after such a test, with Boccaccio for the original
author, and Dryden for the translator, it need shrink from no other.
There is something exceedingly tender and beautiful in the sound of the
concluding lines:

      "If ever chance two wandering lovers brings
      To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs," &c.

The Essay on Man is not Pope's best work.  It is a theory which
Bolingbroke is supposed to have given him, and which he expanded into
verse.  But "he spins the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple
of his argument." All that he says, "the very words, and to the
self-same tune," would prove just as well that whatever is, is _wrong_,
as that whatever is, is _right_.  The Dunciad has splendid passages, but
in general it is dull, heavy, and mechanical.  The sarcasm already quoted
on Settle, the Lord Mayor's poet, (for at that time there was a city as
well as a court poet)

      "Now night descending, the proud scene is o'er,
      But lives in Settle's numbers one day more"--

is the finest inversion of immortality conceivable.  It is even better
than his serious apostrophe to the great heirs of glory, the triumphant
bards of antiquity!

The finest burst of severe moral invective in all Pope, is the
prophetical conclusion of the epilogue to the Satires:

        "Virtue may chuse the high or low degree,
      'Tis just alike to virtue, and to me;
      Dwell in a monk, or light upon a king,
      She's still the same belov'd, contented thing.
      Vice is undone if she forgets her birth,
      And stoops from angels to the dregs of earth.
      But 'tis the Fall degrades her to a whore:
      Let Greatness own her, and she's mean no more.
      Her birth, her beauty, crowds and courts confess,
      Chaste matrons praise her, and grave bishops bless;
      In golden chains the willing world she draws,
      And hers the gospel is, and hers the laws;
      Mounts the tribunal, lifts her scarlet head,
      And sees pale Virtue carted in her stead.
      Lo! at the wheels of her triumphal car,
      Old England's Genius, rough with many a scar,
      Dragged in the dust! his arms hang idly round,
      His flag inverted trains along the ground!
      Our youth, all livery'd o'er with foreign gold,
      Before her dance; behind her, crawl the old!
      See thronging millions to the Pagod run,
      And offer country, parent, wife, or son!
      Hear her black trumpet through the land proclaim,
      That _not to be corrupted is the shame_.
      In soldier, churchman, patriot, man in pow'r,
      'Tis av'rice all, ambition is no more!
      See all our nobles begging to be slaves!
      See all our fools aspiring to be knaves!
      The wit of cheats, the courage of a whore,
      Are what ten thousand envy and adore;
      All, all look up with reverential awe,
      At crimes that 'scape or triumph o'er the law;
      While truth, worth, wisdom, daily they decry:
      Nothing is sacred now but villainy.
      Yet may this verse (if such a verse remain)
      Show there was one who held it in disdain."

His Satires are not in general so good as his Epistles.  His enmity is
effeminate and petulant from a sense of weakness, as his friendship was
tender from a sense of gratitude.  I do not like, for instance, his
character of Chartres, or his characters of women.  His delicacy often
borders upon sickliness; his fastidiousness makes others fastidious.  But
his compliments are divine; they are equal in value to a house or an
estate.  Take the following.  In addressing Lord Mansfield, he speaks of
the grave as a scene,

      "Where Murray, long enough his country's pride,
      Shall be no more than Tully, or than Hyde."

To Bolingbroke he says--

         "Why rail they then if but one wreath of mine,
      Oh all-accomplish'd St. John, deck thy shrine?"

Again, he has bequeathed this praise to Lord Cornbury--

      "Despise low thoughts, low gains:
      Disdain whatever Cornbury disdains;
      Be virtuous and be happy for your pains."

One would think (though there is no knowing) that a descendant of this
nobleman, if there be such a person living, could hardly be guilty of a
mean or paltry action.

The finest piece of personal satire in Pope (perhaps in the world) is
his character of Addison; and this, it may be observed, is of a mixed
kind, made up of his respect for the man, and a cutting sense of his
failings.  The other finest one is that of Buckingham, and the best part
of that is the pleasurable.

               "------Alas! how changed from him,
      That life of pleasure and that soul of whim:
      Gallant and gay, in Cliveden's proud alcove,
      The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love!"

Among his happiest and most inimitable effusions are the Epistles to
Arbuthnot, and to Jervas the painter; amiable patterns of the delightful
unconcerned life, blending ease with dignity, which poets and painters
then led.  Thus he says to Arbuthnot--

        "Why did I write?  What sin to me unknown
      Dipp'd me in ink, my parents' or my own?
      As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,
      I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.
      I left no calling for this idle trade,
      No duty broke, no father disobey'd:
      The muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not wife;
      To help me through this long disease, my life?
      To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care,
      And teach the being you preserv'd to bear.

        But why then publish?  Granville the polite,
      And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write;
      Well-natur'd Garth inflam'd with early praise,
      And Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my lays;
      The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read;
      E'en mitred Rochester would nod the head;
      And St. John's self (great Dryden's friend before)
      With open arms receiv'd one poet more.
      Happy my studies, when by these approv'd!
      Happier their author, when by these belov'd!
      From these the world will judge of men and books,
      Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cooks."

I cannot help giving also the conclusion of the Epistle to Jervas.

        "Oh, lasting as those colours may they shine,
      Free as thy stroke, yet faultless as thy line;
      New graces yearly like thy works display,
      Soft without weakness, without glaring gay;
      Led by some rule, that guides, but not constrains;
      And finish'd more through happiness than pains.
      The kindred arts shall in their praise conspire,
      One dip the pencil, and one string the lyre.
      Yet should the Graces all thy figures place,
      And breathe an air divine on ev'ry face;
      Yet should the Muses bid my numbers roll
      Strong as their charms, and gentle as their soul;
      With Zeuxis' Helen thy Bridgewater vie,
      And these be sung till Granville's Myra die:
      Alas! how little from the grave we claim!
      Thou but preserv'st a face, and I a name."

And shall we cut ourselves off from beauties like these with a
theory? Shall we shut up our books, and seal up our senses, to please
the dull spite and inordinate vanity of those "who have eyes, but they
see not--ears, but they hear not--and understandings, but they
understand not,"--and go about asking our blind guides, whether Pope
was a poet or not? It will never do.  Such persons, when you point out to
them a fine passage in Pope, turn it off to something of the same sort
in some other writer.  Thus they say that the line, "I lisp'd in numbers,
for the numbers came," is pretty, but taken from that of Ovid--_Et
quum conabar scribere, versus erat_.  They are safe in this mode of
criticism: there is no danger of any one's tracing their writings to the
classics.

Pope's letters and prose writings neither take away from, nor add to
his poetical reputation.  There is, occasionally, a littleness of manner,
and an unnecessary degree of caution.  He appears anxious to say a good
thing in every word, as well as every sentence.  They, however, give a
very favourable idea of his moral character in all respects; and his
letters to Atterbury, in his disgrace and exile, do equal honour to
both.  If I had to choose, there are one or two persons, and but one or
two, that I should like to have been better than Pope!

Dryden was a better prose-writer, and a bolder and more varied
versifier than Pope.  He was a more vigorous thinker, a more correct and
logical declaimer, and had more of what may be called strength of mind
than Pope; but he had not the same refinement and delicacy of feeling.
Dryden's eloquence and spirit were possessed in a higher degree by
others, and in nearly the same degree by Pope himself; but that by which
Pope was distinguished, was an essence which he alone possessed, and of
incomparable value on that sole account.  Dryden's Epistles are
excellent, but inferior to Pope's, though they appear (particularly the
admirable one to Congreve) to have been the model on which the latter
formed his.  His Satires are better than Pope's.  His Absalom and
Achitophel is superior, both in force of invective and discrimination of
character, to any thing of Pope's in the same way.  The character of
Achitophel is very fine; and breathes, if not a sincere love for virtue,
a strong spirit of indignation against vice.

Mac Flecknoe is the origin of the idea of the Dunciad; but it is less
elaborately constructed, less feeble, and less heavy.  The difference
between Pope's satirical portraits and Dryden's, appears to be this in a
good measure, that Dryden seems to grapple with his antagonists, and to
describe real persons; Pope seems to refine upon them in his own mind,
and to make them out just what he pleases, till they are not real
characters, but the mere driveling effusions of his spleen and malice.
Pope describes the thing, and then goes on describing his own
description till he loses himself in verbal repetitions.  Dryden recurs
to the object often, takes fresh sittings of nature, and gives us new
strokes of character as well as of his pencil.  The Hind and Panther is
an allegory as well as a satire; and so far it tells less home; the
battery is not so point-blank.  But otherwise it has more genius,
vehemence, and strength of description than any other of Dryden's works,
not excepting the Absalom and Achitophel.  It also contains the finest
examples of varied and sounding versification.  I will quote the
following as an instance of what I mean.  He is complaining of the
treatment which the Papists, under James II. received from the church of
England.

        "Besides these jolly birds, whose corpse impure
      Repaid their commons with their salt manure,
      Another farm he had behind his house,
      Not overstocked, but barely for his use;
      Wherein his poor domestic poultry fed,
      And from his pious hand "received their bread."
      Our pampered pigeons, with malignant eyes,
      Beheld these inmates, and their nurseries;
      Though hard their fare, at evening, and at morn,
      (A cruise of water, and an ear of corn,)
      Yet still they grudged that _modicum,_ and thought
      A sheaf in every single grain was brought.
      Fain would they filch that little food away,
      While unrestrained those happy gluttons prey;
      And much they grieved to see so nigh their hall,
      The bird that warned St. Peter of his fall;
      That he should raise his mitred crest on high,
      And clap his wings, and call his family
      To sacred rites; and vex the ethereal powers
      With midnight mattins at uncivil hours;
      Nay more, his quiet neighbours should molest,
      Just in the sweetness of their morning rest.
      Beast of a bird! supinely when he might
      Lie snug and sleep, to rise before the light!
      What if his dull forefathers us'd that cry,
      Could he not let a bad example die?
      The world was fallen into an easier way:
      This age knew better than to fast and pray.
      Good sense in sacred worship would appear,
      So to begin as they might end the year.
      Such feats in former times had wrought the falls
      Of crowing chanticleers in cloister'd walls.
      Expell'd for this, and for their lands they fled;
      And sister Partlet with her hooded head
      Was hooted hence, because she would not pray a-bed."


There is a magnanimity of abuse in some of these epithets, a fearless
choice of topics of invective, which may be considered as the heroical
in satire.

The _Annus Mirabilis_ is a tedious performance; it is a tissue of
far-fetched, heavy, lumbering conceits, and in the worst style of what
has been denominated metaphysical poetry.  His Odes in general are of the
same stamp; they are the hard-strained offspring of a meagre,
meretricious fancy.  The famous Ode on St. Cecilia deserves its
reputation; for, as piece of poetical mechanism to be set to music, or
recited in alternate strophe and antistrophe, with classical allusions,
and flowing verse, nothing can be better.  It is equally fit to be said
or sung; it is not equally good to read.  It is lyrical, without being
epic or dramatic.  For instance, the description of Bacchus,

      "The jolly god in triumph comes,
      Sound the trumpets, beat the drums;
      Flush'd with a purple grace,
      He shews his honest face"--

does not answer, as it ought, to our idea of the God, returning from the
conquest of India, with satyrs and wild beasts, that he had tamed,
following in his train; crowned with vine leaves, and riding in a
chariot drawn by leopards--such as we have seen him painted by Titian
or Rubens! Lyrical poetry, of all others, bears the nearest resemblance
to painting: it deals in hieroglyphics and passing figures, which depend
for effect, not on the working out, but on the selection.  It is the
dance and pantomime of poetry.  In variety and rapidity of movement, the
Alexander's Feast has all that can be required in this respect; it only
wants loftiness and truth of character.

Dryden's plays are better than Pope could have written; for though he
does not go out of himself by the force of imagination, he goes out of
himself by the force of common-places and rhetorical dialogue.  On the
other hand, they are not so good as Shakspeare's; but he has left the
best character of Shakspeare that has ever been written. [5]

His alterations from Chaucer and Boccaccio shew a greater knowledge
of the taste of his readers and power of pleasing them, than
acquaintance with the genius of his authors.  He ekes out the lameness of
the verse in the former, and breaks the force of the passion in both.
The Tancred and Sigismunda is the only general exception, in which, I
think, he has fully retained, if not improved upon, the impassioned
declamation of the original.  The Honoria has none of the bewildered,
dreary, preternatural effect of Boccaccio's story.  Nor has the Flower
and the Leaf any thing of the enchanting simplicity and concentrated
feeling of Chaucer's romantic fiction.  Dryden, however, sometimes seemed
to indulge himself as well as his readers, as in keeping entire that
noble line in Palamon's address to Venus:

      "Thou gladder of the mount of Cithaeron!"

His Tales have been, upon the whole, the most popular of his works;
and I should think that a translation of some of the other serious tales
in Boccaccio and Chaucer, as that of Isabella, the Falcon, of Constance,
the Prioress's Tale, and others, if executed with taste and spirit,
could not fail to succeed in the present day.

[5] "To begin then with Shakspeare: he was the man who of all modern,
and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul.
All the images of nature were still present to him, and he drew them not
laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than see
it, you feel it too.  Those who accuse him to have wanted learning, give
him the greater commendation: he was naturally learned: he needed not
the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards and found her
there.  I cannot say, he is every where alike; were he so, I should do
him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind.  He is many times
flat, and insipid; his comic wit degenerating into clenches, his serious
swelling into bombast.  But he is always great, when some great occasion
is presented to him.  No man can say, he ever had a fit subject for his
wit, and did not then raise himself as high above the rest of poets,
      _Quantum lenta solent inter Viburna Cupressi_."

It should appear, in tracing the history of our literature, that
poetry had, at the period of which we are speaking, in general declined,
by successive gradations, from the poetry of imagination, in the time of
Elizabeth, to the poetry of fancy (to adopt a modern distinction) in the
time of Charles I.; and again from the poetry of fancy to that of wit,
as in the reign of Charles II. and Queen Anne.  It degenerated into the
poetry of mere common places, both in style and thought, in the
succeeding reigns: as in the latter part of the last century, it was
transformed, by means of the French Revolution, into the poetry of
paradox.

Of Donne I know nothing but some beautiful verses to his wife,
dissuading her from accompanying him on his travels abroad, and some
quaint riddles in verse, which the Sphinx could not unravel.

Waller still lives in the name of Sacharissa; and his lines on the
death of Oliver Cromwell shew that he was a man not without genius and
strength of thought.

Marvel is a writer of nearly the same period, and worthy of a better
age.  Some of his verses are harsh, as the words of Mercury; others
musical, as is Apollo's lute.  Of the latter kind are his boat-song, his
description of a fawn, and his lines to Lady Vere.  His lines prefixed to
Paradise Lost are by no means the most favourable specimen of his
powers.

Butler's Hudibras is a poem of more wit than any other in the
language.  The rhymes have as much genius in them as the thoughts; but
there is no story in it, and but little humour.  Humour is the making
others act or talk absurdly and unconsciously: wit is the pointing out
and ridiculing that absurdity consciously, and with more or less
ill-nature.  The fault of Butler's poem is not that it has too much wit,
but that it has not an equal quantity of other things.  One would suppose
that the starched manners and sanctified grimace of the times in which
he lived, would of themselves have been sufficiently rich in ludicrous
incidents and characters; but they seem rather to have irritated his
spleen, than to have drawn forth his powers of picturesque imitation.
Certainly if we compare Hudibras with Don Quixote in this respect, it
seems rather a meagre and unsatisfactory performance.

Rochester's poetry is the poetry of wit combined with the love of
pleasure, of thought with licentiousness.  His extravagant heedless
levity has a sort of passionate enthusiasm in it; his contempt for every
thing that others respect, almost amounts to sublimity.  His poem upon
Nothing is itself no trifling work.  His epigrams were the bitterest, the
least laboured, and the truest, that ever were written.

Sir John Suckling was of the same mercurial stamp, but with a greater
fund of animal spirits; as witty, but less malicious.  His Ballad on a
Wedding is perfect in its kind, and has a spirit of high enjoyment in
it, of sportive fancy, a liveliness of description, and a truth of
nature, that never were surpassed.  It is superior to either Gay or
Prior; for with all their _naivete_ and terseness, it has a Shakspearian
grace and luxuriance about it, which they could not have reached.

Denham and Cowley belong to the same period, but were quite distinct
from each other: the one was grave and prosing, the other melancholy and
fantastical.  There are a number of good lines and good thoughts in the
Cooper's Hill.  And in Cowley there is an inexhaustible fund of sense and
ingenuity, buried in inextricable conceits, and entangled in the cobwebs
of the schools.  He was a great man, not a great poet.  But I shall say no
more on this subject.  I never wish to meddle with names that are sacred,
unless when they stand in the way of things that are more sacred.

Withers is a name now almost forgotten, and his works seldom read;
but his poetry is not unfrequently distinguished by a tender and
pastoral turn of thought; and there is one passage of exquisite feeling,
describing the consolations of poetry in the following terms:

        "She doth tell me where to borrow
      Comfort in the midst of sorrow;
      Makes the desolatest place [6]
      To her presence be a grace;
      And the blackest discontents
      Be her fairest ornaments.
      In my former days of bliss
      Her divine skill taught me this,
      That from every thing I saw,
      I could some invention draw;
      And raise pleasure to her height,
      Through the meanest object's sight,
      By the murmur of a spring,
      Or the least bough's rusteling,
      By a daisy whose leaves spread
      Shut when Titan goes to bed;
      Or a shady bush or tree,
      She could more infuse in me,
      Than all Nature's beauties can,
      In some other wiser man.
      By her help I also now
      Make this churlish place allow
      Some things that may sweeten gladness
      In the very gall of sadness.
      The dull loneness, the black shade,
      That these hanging vaults have made,
      The strange music of the waves,
      Beating on these hollow caves,
      This black den which rocks emboss,
      Overgrown with eldest moss,
      The rude portals that give light
      More to terror than delight,
      This my chamber of neglect,
      Wall'd about with disrespect,
      From all these and this dull air,
      A fit object for despair,
      She hath taught me by her might
      To draw comfort and delight.
      Therefore, thou best earthly bliss,
      I will cherish thee for this.
      Poesie; thou sweet'st content
      That ere Heav'n to mortals lent:
      Though they as a trifle leave thee,
      Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee,
      Though thou be to them a scorn,
      That to nought but earth are born:
      Let my life no longer be
      Than I am in love with thee.
      Though our wise ones call thee madness,
      Let me never taste of sadness,
      If I love not thy maddest fits,
      Above all their greatest wits.
      And though some too seeming holy,
      Do account thy raptures folly,
      Thou dost teach me to contemn
      What makes knaves and fools of them."

LECTURE V.
ON THOMSON AND COWPER.


Thomson, the kind-hearted Thomson, was the most indolent of mortals
and of poets.  But he was also one of the best both of mortals and of
poets.  Dr. Johnson makes it his praise that he wrote "no line which
dying he would wish to blot." Perhaps a better proof of his honest
simplicity, and inoffensive goodness of disposition, would be that he
wrote no line which any other person living would wish that he should
blot.  Indeed, he himself wished, on his death-bed, formally to expunge
his dedication of one of the Seasons to that finished courtier, and
candid biographer of his own life, Bub Doddington.  As critics, however,
not as moralists, we might say on the other hand--"Would he had
blotted a thousand!"--The same suavity of temper and sanguine warmth
of feeling which threw such a natural grace and genial spirit of
enthusiasm over his poetry, was also the cause of its inherent vices and
defects.  He is affected through carelessness: pompous from unsuspecting
simplicity of character.  He is frequently pedantic and ostentatious in
his style, because he had no consciousness of these vices in himself.  He
mounts upon stilts, not out of vanity, but indolence.  He seldom writes a
good line, but he makes up for it by a bad one.  He takes advantage of
all the most trite and mechanical common-places of imagery and diction
as a kindly relief to his Muse, and as if he thought them quite as good,
and likely to be quite as acceptable to the reader, as his own poetry.
He did not think the difference worth putting himself to the trouble of
accomplishing.  He had too little art to conceal his art: or did not even
seem to know that there was any occasion for it.  His art is as naked and
undisguised as his nature; the one is as pure and genuine as the other
is gross, gaudy, and meretricious.--All that is admirable in the
Seasons, is the emanation of a fine natural genius, and sincere love of
his subject, unforced, unstudied, that comes uncalled for, and departs
unbidden.  But he takes no pains, uses no self-correction; or if he seems
to labour, it is worse than labour lost.  His genius "cannot be
constrained by mastery." The feeling of nature, of the changes of the
seasons, was in his mind; and he could not help conveying this feeling
to the reader, by the mere force of spontaneous expression; but if the
expression did not come of itself, he left the whole business to chance;
or, willing to evade instead of encountering the difficulties of his
subject, fills up the intervals of true inspiration with the most vapid
and worthless materials, pieces out a beautiful half line with a
bombastic allusion, or overloads an exquisitely natural sentiment or
image with a cloud of painted, pompous, cumbrous phrases, like the
shower of roses, in which he represents the Spring, his own lovely,
fresh, and innocent Spring, as descending to the earth.

      "Come, gentle Spring! ethereal Mildness! come,
      And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud,
      While music wakes around, veil'd in a shower
      Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend."

Who, from such a flimsy, round-about, unmeaning commencement as this,
would expect the delightful, unexaggerated, home-felt descriptions of
natural scenery, which are scattered in such unconscious profusion
through this and the following cantos? For instance, the very next
passage is crowded with a set of striking images.

      "And see where surly Winter passes off
      Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts:
      His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill,
      The shatter'd forest, and the ravag'd vale;
      While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch
      Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost,
      The mountains lift their green heads to the sky.
      As yet the trembling year is unconfirmed,
      And Winter oft at eve resumes the breeze,
      Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets
      Deform the day delightless; so that scarce
      The bittern knows his time with bill ingulpht
      To shake the sounding marsh, or from the shore
      The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath,
      And sing their wild notes to the list'ning waste."

Thomson is the best of our descriptive poets: for he gives most of
the poetry of natural description.  Others have been quite equal to him,
or have surpassed him, as Cowper for instance, in the picturesque part
of his art, in marking the peculiar features and curious details of
objects;--no one has yet come up to him in giving the sum total of
their effects, their varying influences on the mind.  He does not go into
the _minutiae_ of a landscape, but describes the vivid impression which
the whole makes upon his own imagination; and thus transfers the same
unbroken, unimpaired impression to the imagination of his readers.  The
colours with which he paints seem yet wet and breathing, like those of
the living statue in the Winter's Tale.  Nature in his descriptions is
seen growing around us, fresh and lusty as in itself.  We feel the effect
of the atmosphere, its humidity or clearness, its heat or cold, the glow
of summer, the gloom of winter, the tender promise of the spring, the
full overshadowing foliage, the declining pomp and deepening tints of
autumn.  He transports us to the scorching heat of vertical suns, or
plunges us into the chilling horrors and desolation of the frozen zone.
We hear the snow drifting against the broken casement without, and see
the fire blazing on the hearth within.  The first scattered drops of a
vernal shower patter on the leaves above our heads, or the coming storm
resounds through the leafless groves.  In a word, he describes not to the
eye alone, but to the other senses, and to the whole man.  He puts his
heart into his subject, writes as he feels, and humanises whatever he
touches.  He makes all his descriptions teem with life and vivifying
soul.  His faults were those of his style--of the author and the man;
but the original genius of the poet, the pith and marrow of his
imagination, the fine natural mould in which his feelings were bedded,
were too much for him to counteract by neglect, or affectation, or false
ornaments.  It is for this reason that he is, perhaps, the most popular
of all our poets, treating of a subject that all can understand, and in
a way that is interesting to all alike, to the ignorant or the refined,
because he gives back the impression which the things themselves make
upon us in nature.  "That," said a man of genius, seeing a little shabby
soiled copy of Thomson's Seasons lying on the window-seat of an obscure
country alehouse--"That is true fame!"

It has been supposed by some, that the Castle of Indolence is
Thomson's best poem; but that is not the case.  He has in it, indeed,
poured out the whole soul of indolence, diffuse, relaxed, supine,
dissolved into a voluptuous dream; and surrounded himself with a set of
objects and companions, in entire unison with the listlessness of his
own temper.  Nothing can well go beyond the descriptions of these inmates
of the place, and their luxurious pampered way of life--of him who
came among them like "a burnished fly in month of June," but soon left
them on his heedless way; and him,

      "For whom the merry bells had rung, I ween,
      If in this nook of quiet, bells had ever been."

The in-door quiet and cushioned ease, where "all was one full-swelling
bed"; the out-of-door stillness, broken only by "the stock-dove's plaint
amid the forest deep,"

      "That drowsy rustled to the sighing gale"--

are in the most perfect and delightful keeping.  But still there are no
passages in this exquisite little production of sportive ease and fancy,
equal to the best of those in the Seasons.  Warton, in his Essay on Pope,
was the first to point out and do justice to some of these; for
instance, to the description of the effects of the contagion among our
ships at Carthagena--"of the frequent corse heard nightly plunged amid
the sullen waves," and to the description of the pilgrims lost in the
deserts of Arabia.  This last passage, profound and striking as it is, is
not free from those faults of style which I have already noticed.

                    "------Breath'd hot
      From all the boundless furnace of the sky,
      And the wide-glitt'ring waste of burning sand,
      A suffocating wind the pilgrim smites
      With instant death.  Patient of thirst and toil,
      Son of the desert, ev'n the camel feels
      Shot through his wither'd heart the fiery blast.
      Or from the black-red ether, bursting broad,
      Sallies the sudden whirlwind.  Straight the sands,
      Commov'd around, in gath'ring eddies play;
      Nearer and nearer still they dark'ning come,
      Till with the gen'ral all-involving storm
      Swept up, the whole continuous wilds arise,
      And by their noon-day fount dejected thrown,
      Or sunk at night in sad disastrous sleep,
      Beneath descending hills the caravan
      Is buried deep.  In Cairo's crowded streets,
      Th' impatient merchant, wond'ring, waits in vain;
      And Mecca saddens at the long delay."

There are other passages of equal beauty with these; such as that of
the hunted stag, followed by "the inhuman rout,"

          "------That from the shady depth
      Expel him, circling through his ev'ry shift.
      He sweeps the forest oft, and sobbing sees
      The glades mild op'ning to the golden day,
      Where in kind contest with his butting friends
      He wont to struggle, or his loves enjoy."

The whole of the description of the frozen zone, in the Winter, is
perhaps even finer and more thoroughly felt, as being done from early
associations, than that of the torrid zone in his Summer.  Any thing more
beautiful than the following account of the Siberian exiles is, I think,
hardly to be found in the whole range of poetry.

      "There through the prison of unbounded wilds,
      Barr'd by the hand of nature from escape,
      Wide roams the Russian exile.  Nought around
      Strikes his sad eye but deserts lost in snow,
      And heavy-loaded groves, and solid floods,
      That stretch athwart the solitary vast
      Their icy horrors to the frozen main;
      And cheerless towns far distant, never bless'd,
      Save when its annual course the caravan
      Bends to the golden coast of rich Cathay,
      With news of human kind."

The feeling of loneliness, of distance, of lingering, slow-revolving
years of pining expectation, of desolation within and without the heart,
was never more finely expressed than it is here.

The account which follows of the employments of the Polar night--of
the journeys of the natives by moonlight, drawn by rein-deer, and of the
return of spring in Lapland--

      "Where pure Niemi's fairy mountains rise,
      And fring'd with roses Tenglio rolls his stream,"

is equally picturesque and striking in a different way.  The traveller
lost in the snow, is a well-known and admirable dramatic episode.  I
prefer, however, giving one example of our author's skill in painting
common domestic scenery, as it will bear a more immediate comparison
with the style of some later writers on such subjects.  It is of little
consequence what passage we take.  The following description of the
first setting in of winter is, perhaps, as pleasing as any.

      "Through the hush'd air the whitening shower descends,
      At first thin wav'ring, till at last the flakes
      Fall broad and wide, and fast, dimming the day
      With a continual flow.  The cherish'd fields
      Put on their winter-robe of purest white:
      'Tis brightness all, save where the new snow melts
      Along the mazy current.  Low the woods
      Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid Sun,
      Faint, from the West emits his ev'ning ray,
      Earth's universal face, deep hid, and chill,
      Is one wide dazzling waste, that buries wide
      The works of man.  Drooping, the lab'rer-ox
      Stands cover'd o'er with snow, and then demands
      The fruit of all his toil.  The fowls of heav'n,
      Tam'd by the cruel season, crowd around
      The winnowing store, and claim the little boon
      Which Providence assigns them.  One alone,
      The red-breast, sacred to the household Gods,
      Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,
      In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves
      His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man
      His annual visit.  Half-afraid, he first
      Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights
      On the warm hearth; then hopping o'er the floor,
      Eyes all the smiling family askance,
      And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is:
      Till more familiar grown, the table-crumbs
      Attract his slender feet.  The foodless wilds
      Pour forth their brown inhabitants.  The hare,
      Though timorous of heart, and hard beset
      By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs,
      And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,
      Urg'd on by fearless want.  The bleating kind [sic]
      Eye the bleak heav'n, and next, the glist'ning earth,
      With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispers'd,
      Dig for the wither'd herb through heaps of snow."

It is thus that Thomson always gives a _moral sense_ to nature.

Thomson's blank verse is not harsh, or utterly untuneable; but it is
heavy and monotonous; it seems always labouring up-hill.  The selections
which have been made from his works in Enfield's Speaker, and other
books of extracts, do not convey the most favourable idea of his genius
or taste; such as Palemon and Lavinia, Damon and Musidora, Celadon and
Amelia.  Those parts of any author which are most liable to be stitched
in worsted, and framed and glazed, are not by any means always the best.
The moral descriptions and reflections in the Seasons are in an
admirable spirit, and written with great force and fervour.

His poem on Liberty is not equally good: his Muse was too easy and
good-natured for the subject, which required as much indignation against
unjust and arbitrary power, as complacency in the constitutional
monarchy, under which, just after the expulsion of the Stuarts and the
establishment of the House of Hanover, in contempt of the claims of
hereditary pretenders to the throne, Thomson lived.  Thomson was but an
indifferent hater; and the most indispensable part of the love of
liberty has unfortunately hitherto been the hatred of tyranny.  Spleen is
the soul of patriotism, and of public good: but you would not expect a
man who has been seen eating peaches off a tree with both hands in his
waistcoat pockets, to be "overrun with the spleen," or to heat himself
needlessly about an abstract proposition.

His plays are liable to the same objection.  They are never acted, and
seldom read.  The author could not, or would not, put himself out of his
way, to enter into the situations and passions of others, particularly
of a tragic kind.  The subject of Tancred and Sigismunda, which is taken
from a serious episode in Gil Blas, is an admirable one, but poorly
handled: the ground may be considered as still unoccupied.

Cowper, whom I shall speak of in this connection, lived at a
considerable distance of time after Thomson; and had some advantages
over him, particularly in simplicity of style, in a certain precision
and minuteness of graphical description, and in a more careful and
leisurely choice of such topics only as his genius and peculiar habits
of mind prompted him to treat of.  The Task has fewer blemishes than the
Seasons; but it has not the same capital excellence, the "unbought
grace" of poetry, the power of moving and infusing the warmth of the
author's mind into that of the reader.  If Cowper had a more polished
taste, Thomson had, beyond comparison, a more fertile genius, more
impulsive force, a more entire forgetfulness of himself in his subject.
If in Thomson you are sometimes offended with the slovenliness of the
author by profession, determined to get through his task at all events;
in Cowper you are no less dissatisfied with the finicalness of the
private gentleman, who does not care whether he completes his work or
not; and in whatever he does, is evidently more solicitous to please
himself than the public.  There is an effeminacy about him, which shrinks
from and repels common and hearty sympathy.  With all his boasted
simplicity and love of the country, he seldom launches out into general
descriptions of nature: he looks at her over his clipped hedges, and
from his well-swept garden-walks; or if he makes a bolder experiment now
and then, it is with an air of precaution, as if he were afraid of being
caught in a shower of rain, or of not being able, in case of any
untoward accident, to make good his retreat home.  He shakes hands with
nature with a pair of fashionable gloves on, and leads "his Vashti"
forth to public view with a look of consciousness and attention to
etiquette, as a fine gentleman hands a lady out to dance a minuet.  He is
delicate to fastidiousness, and glad to get back, after a romantic
adventure with crazy Kate, a party of gypsies or a little child on a
common, to the drawing room and the ladies again, to the sofa and the
tea-kettle--No, I beg his pardon, not to the singing, well-scoured
tea-kettle, but to the polished and loud-hissing urn.  His walks and
arbours are kept clear of worms and snails, with as much an appearance
of _petit-maitreship_ as of humanity.  He has some of the sickly
sensibility and pampered refinements of Pope; but then Pope prided
himself in them: whereas, Cowper affects to be all simplicity and
plainness.  He had neither Thomson's love of the unadorned beauties of
nature, nor Pope's exquisite sense of the elegances of art.  He was, in
fact, a nervous man, afraid of trusting himself to the seductions of the
one, and ashamed of putting forward his pretensions to an intimacy with
the other: but to be a coward, is not the way to succeed either in
poetry, in war, or in love! Still he is a genuine poet, and deserves all
his reputation.  His worst vices are amiable weaknesses, elegant
trifling.  Though there is a frequent dryness, timidity, and jejuneness
in his manner, he has left a number of pictures of domestic comfort and
social refinement, as well as of natural imagery and feeling, which can
hardly be forgotten but with the language itself.  Such, among others,
are his memorable description of the post coming in, that of the
preparations for tea in a winter's evening in the country, of the
unexpected fall of snow, of the frosty morning (with the fine satirical
transition to the Empress of Russia's palace of ice), and most of all,
the winter's walk at noon.  Every one of these may be considered as
distinct studies, or highly finished cabinet-pieces, arranged without
order or coherence.  I shall be excused for giving the last of them, as
what has always appeared to me one of the most feeling, elegant, and
perfect specimens of this writer's manner.

      "The night was winter in his roughest mood;
      The morning sharp and clear.  But now at noon
      Upon the southern side of the slant hills,
      And where the woods fence off the northern blast,
      The season smiles, resigning all its rage,
      And has the warmth of May.  The vault is blue,
      Without a cloud, and white without a speck
      The dazzling splendour of the scene below.
      Again the harmony comes o'er the vale;
      And through the trees I view th' embattled tow'r,
      Whence all the music.  I again perceive
      The soothing influence of the wafted strains,
      And settle in soft musings as I tread
      The walk, still verdant, under oaks and elms,
      Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.
      The roof, though moveable through all its length,
      As the wind sways it, has yet well suffic'd,
      And, intercepting in their silent fall
      The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.
      No noise is here, or none that hinders thought.
      The redbreast warbles still, but is content
      With slender notes, and more than half suppress'd.
      Pleas'd with his solitude, and flitting light
      From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes
      From many a twig the pendent drop of ice,
      That tinkle in the wither'd leaves below.
      Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,
      Charms more than silence.  Meditation here
      May think down hours to moments.  Here the heart
      May give a useful lesson to the head,
      And Learning wiser grow without his books.
      Knowledge and Wisdom, far from being one,
      Have oft-times no connection.  Knowledge dwells
      In heads replete with thoughts of other men;
      Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
      Books are not seldom talismans and spells,
      By which the magic art of shrewder wits
      Holds an unthinking multitude enthrall'd.
      Some to the fascination of a name
      Surrender judgment hood-wink'd.  Some the style
      Infatuates, and through labyrinths and wilds
      Of error leads them, by a tune entranc'd.
      While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear
      The insupportable fatigue of thought,
      And swallowing therefore without pause or choice
      The total grist unsifted, husks and all.
      But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course
      Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,
      And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,
      And lanes, in which the primrose ere her time
      Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,
      Deceive no student.  Wisdom there, and truth,
      Not shy, as in the world, and to be won
      By slow solicitation, seize at once
      The roving thought, and fix it on themselves."

His satire is also excellent.  It is pointed and forcible, with the
polished manners of the gentleman, and the honest indignation of the
virtuous man.  His religious poetry, except where it takes a tincture of
controversial heat, wants elevation and fire.  His Muse had not a
seraph's wing.  I might refer, in illustration of this opinion, to the
laboured anticipation of the Millennium at the end of the sixth book.  He
could describe a piece of shell-work as well as any modern poet: but he
could not describe the New Jerusalem so well as John Bunyan;--nor are
his verses on Alexander Selkirk so good as Robinson Crusoe.  The one is
not so much like a vision, nor is the other so much like the reality.

The first volume of Cowper's poems has, however, been less read than
it deserved.  The comparison in these poems of the proud and humble
believer to the peacock and the pheasant, and the parallel between
Voltaire and the poor cottager, are exquisite pieces of eloquence and
poetry, particularly the last.

        "Yon cottager, who weaves at her own door,
      Pillow and bobbins all her little store;
      Content though mean, and cheerful if not gay,
      Shuffling her threads about the live-long day,
      Just earns a scanty pittance, and at night,
      Lies down secure, her heart and pocket light;
      She, for her humble sphere by nature fit,
      Has little understanding, and no wit,
      Receives no praise; but, though her lot be such,
      (Toilsome and indigent) she renders much;
      Just knows, and knows no more, her Bible true--
      A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew;
      And in that charter reads with sparkling eyes
      Her title to a treasure in the skies.

        O happy peasant!  Oh unhappy bard!
      His the mere tinsel, hers the rich reward;
      He prais'd, perhaps, for ages yet to come,
      She never heard of half a mile from home:
      He lost in errors his vain heart prefers,
      She safe in the simplicity of hers."

His character of Whitfield, in the poem on Hope, is one of his most
spirited and striking things.  It is written _con amore_.

        "But if, unblameable in word and thought,
      A man arise, a man whom God has taught,
      With all Elijah's dignity of tone,
      And all the love of the beloved John,
      To storm the citadels they build in air,
      To smite the untemper'd wall ('tis death to spare,)
      To sweep away all refuges of lies,
      And place, instead of quirks, themselves devise,
      Lama Sabachthani before their eyes;
      To show that without Christ all gain is loss,
      All hope despair that stands not on his cross;
      Except a few his God may have impressed,
      A tenfold phrensy seizes all the rest."

These lines were quoted, soon after their appearance, by the Monthly
Reviewers, to shew that Cowper was no poet, though they afterwards took
credit to themselves for having been the first to introduce his verses
to the notice of the public.  It is not a little remarkable that these
same critics regularly damned, at its first coming out, every work which
has since acquired a standard reputation with the public.--Cowper's
verses on his mother's picture, and his lines to Mary, are some of the
most pathetic that ever were written.  His stanzas on the loss of the
Royal George have a masculine strength and feeling beyond what was usual
with him.  The story of John Gilpin has perhaps given as much pleasure to
as many people as any thing of the same length that ever was written.

His life was an unhappy one.  It was embittered by a morbid affection,
and by his religious sentiments.  Nor are we to wonder at this, or bring
it as a charge against religion; for it is the nature of the poetical
temperament to carry every thing to excess, whether it be love,
religion, pleasure, or pain, as we may see in the case of Cowper and of
Burns, and to find torment or rapture in that in which others merely
find a resource from _ennui_, or a relaxation from common occupation.

There are two poets still living who belong to the same class of
excellence, and of whom I shall here say a few words; I mean Crabbe, and
Robert Bloomfield, the author of the Farmer's Boy.  As a painter of
simple natural scenery, and of the still life of the country, few
writers have more undeniable and unassuming pretensions than the
ingenious and self-taught poet, last-mentioned.  Among the sketches of
this sort I would mention, as equally distinguished for delicacy,
faithfulness, and _naivete_, his description of lambs racing, of the
pigs going out an acorning, of the boy sent to feed his sheep before the
break of day in winter; and I might add the innocently told story of the
poor bird-boy, who in vain through the live-long day expects his
promised companions at his hut, to share his feast of roasted sloes with
him, as an example of that humble pathos, in which this author excels.
The fault indeed of his genius is that it is too humble: his Muse has
something not only rustic, but menial in her aspect.  He seems afraid of
elevating nature, lest she should be ashamed of him.  Bloomfield very
beautifully describes the lambs in springtime as racing round the
hillocks of green turf: Thomson, in describing the same image, makes the
mound of earth the remains of an old Roman encampment.  Bloomfield never
gets beyond his own experience; and that is somewhat confined.  He gives
the simple appearance of nature, but he gives it naked, shivering, and
unclothed with the drapery of a moral imagination.  His poetry has much
the effect of the first approach of spring, "while yet the year is
unconfirmed," where a few tender buds venture forth here and there, but
are chilled by the early frosts and nipping breath of poverty.--It
should seem from this and other instances that have occurred within the
last century, that we cannot expect from original genius alone, without
education, in modern and more artificial periods, the same bold and
independent results as in former periods.  And one reason appears to be,
that though such persons, from whom we might at first expect a
restoration of the good old times of poetry, are not encumbered and
enfeebled by the trammels of custom, and the dull weight of other men's
ideas; yet they are oppressed by the consciousness of a want of the
common advantages which others have; are looking at the tinsel finery of
the age, while they neglect the rich unexplored mine in their own
breasts; and instead of setting an example for the world to follow,
spend their lives in aping, or in the despair of aping, the hackneyed
accomplishments of their inferiors.  Another cause may be, that original
genius alone is not sufficient to produce the highest excellence,
without a corresponding state of manners, passions, and religious
belief: that no single mind can move in direct opposition to the vast
machine of the world around it; that the poet can do no more than stamp
the mind of his age upon his works; and that all that the ambition of
the highest genius can hope to arrive at, after the lapse of one or two
generations, is the perfection of that more refined and effeminate style
of studied elegance and adventitious ornament, which is the result, not
of nature, but of art.  In fact, no other style of poetry has succeeded,
or seems likely to succeed, in the present day.  The public taste hangs
like a millstone round the neck of all original genius that does not
conform to established and exclusive models.  The writer is not only
without popular sympathy, but without a rich and varied mass of
materials for his mind to work upon and assimilate unconsciously to
itself; his attempts at originality are looked upon as affectation, and
in the end, degenerate into it from the natural spirit of contradiction,
and the constant uneasy sense of disappointment and undeserved ridicule.
But to return.

Crabbe is, if not the most natural, the most literal of our descriptive
poets.  He exhibits the smallest circumstances of the smallest
things.  He gives the very costume of meanness; the nonessentials
of every trifling incident.  He is his own landscape-painter,
and engraver too.  His pastoral scenes seem pricked on paper
in little dotted lines.  He describes the interior of a cottage
like a person sent there to distrain for rent.  He has an eye to the
number of arms in an old worm-eaten chair, and takes care to inform
himself and the reader whether a joint-stool stands upon three legs or
upon four.  If a settle by the fire-side stands awry, it gives him as
much disturbance as a tottering world; and he records the rent in a
ragged counterpane as an event in history.  He is equally curious in his
back-grounds and in his figures.  You know the Christian and surnames of
every one of his heroes,--the dates of their achievements, whether on a
Sunday or a Monday,--their place of birth and burial, the colour of
their clothes, and of their hair, and whether they squinted or not.  He
takes an inventory of the human heart exactly in the same manner as of
the furniture of a sick room: his sentiments have very much the air of
fixtures; he gives you the petrifaction of a sigh, and carves a tear, to
the life, in stone.  Almost all his characters are tired of their lives,
and you heartily wish them dead.  They remind one of anatomical
preservations; or may be said to bear the same relation to actual life
that a stuffed cat in a glass-case does to the real one purring on the
hearth: the skin is the same, but the life and the sense of heat is
gone.  Crabbe's poetry is like a museum, or curiosity-shop: every thing
has the same posthumous appearance, the same inanimateness and identity
of character.  If Bloomfield is too much of the Farmer's Boy, Crabbe is
too much of the parish beadle, an overseer of the country poor.  He has
no delight beyond the walls of a workhouse, and his officious zeal would
convert the world into a vast infirmary.  He is a kind of Ordinary, not
of Newgate, but of nature.  His poetical morality is taken from Burn's
Justice, or the Statutes against Vagrants.  He sets his own imagination
in the stocks, and his Muse, like Malvolio, "wears cruel garters." He
collects all the petty vices of the human heart, and superintends, as in
a panopticon, a select circle of rural malefactors.  He makes out the
poor to be as bad as the rich--a sort of vermin for the others to hunt
down and trample upon, and this he thinks a good piece of work.  With him
there are but two moral categories, riches and poverty, authority and
dependence.  His parish apprentice, Richard Monday, and his wealthy
baronet, Sir Richard Monday, of Monday-place, are the same individual--
the extremes of the same character, and of his whole system.  "The latter
end of his Commonwealth does not forget the beginning." But his parish
ethics are the very worst model for a state: any thing more degrading
and helpless cannot well be imagined.  He exhibits just the contrary view
of human life to that which Gay has done in his Beggar's Opera.  In a
word, Crabbe is the only poet who has attempted and succeeded in the
_still life_ of tragedy: who gives the stagnation of hope and fear--
the deformity of vice without the temptation--the pain of sympathy
without the interest--and who seems to rely, for the delight he is to
convey to his reader, on the truth and accuracy with which he describes
only what is disagreeable.

The best descriptive poetry is not, after all, to be found in our
descriptive poets.  There are set descriptions of the flowers, for
instance, in Thomson, Cowper, and others; but none equal to those in
Milton's Lycidas, and in the Winter's Tale.

We have few good pastorals in the language.  Our manners are not
Arcadian; our climate is not an eternal spring; our age is not the age
of gold.  We have no pastoral-writers equal to Theocritus, nor any
landscapes like those of Claude Lorraine.  The best parts of Spenser's
Shepherd's Calendar are two fables, Mother Hubberd's Tale, and the Oak
and the Briar; which last is as splendid a piece of oratory as any to be
found in the records of the eloquence of the British senate! Browne, who
came after Spenser, and Withers, have left some pleasing allegorical
poems of this kind.  Pope's are as full of senseless finery and trite
affectation, as if a peer of the realm were to sit for his picture with
a crook and cocked hat on, smiling with an insipid air of no-meaning,
between nature and fashion.  Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia is a lasting
monument of perverted power; where an image of extreme beauty, as that
of "the shepherd boy piping as though he should never be old," peeps out
once in a hundred folio pages, amidst heaps of intricate sophistry and
scholastic quaintness.  It is not at all like Nicholas Poussin's picture,
in which he represents some shepherds wandering out in a morning of the
spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription--"I also was an
Arcadian!" Perhaps the best pastoral in the language is that prose-poem,
Walton's Complete Angler.  That well-known work has a beauty and romantic
interest equal to its simplicity, and arising out of it.  In the
description of a fishing-tackle, you perceive the piety and humanity of
the author's mind.  It is to be doubted whether Sannazarius's Piscatory
Eclogues are equal to the scenes described by Walton on the banks of the
river Lea.  He gives the feeling of the open air: we walk with him along
the dusty road-side, or repose on the banks of the river under a shady
tree; and in watching for the finny prey, imbibe what he beautifully
calls "the patience and simplicity of poor honest fishermen." We
accompany them to their inn at night, and partake of their simple, but
delicious fare; while Maud, the pretty milk-maid, at her mother's
desire, sings the classical ditties of the poet Marlow; "Come live with
me, and be my love." Good cheer is not neglected in this work, any more
than in Homer, or any other history that sets a proper value on the good
things of this life.  The prints in the Complete Angler give an
additional reality and interest to the scenes it describes.  While
Tottenham Cross shall stand, and longer, thy work, amiable and happy old
man, shall last!--It is in the notes to it that we find that character
of "a fair and happy milkmaid," by Sir Thomas Overbury, which may vie in
beauty and feeling with Chaucer's character of Griselda.

      "A fair and happy milk-maid is a country wench that is so far from
making herself beautiful by art, that one look of her's is able to put
all face-physic out of countenance.  She knows a fair look is but a dumb
orator to commend virtue, therefore minds it not.  All her excellences
stand in her so silently, as if they had stolen upon her without her
knowledge.  The lining of her apparel (which is herself) is far better
than outsides of tissue; for though she be not arrayed in the spoil of
the silkworm, she is decked in innocency, a far better wearing.  She doth
not, with lying long in bed, spoil both her complexion and conditions.
Nature hath taught her, too immoderate sleep is rust to the soul: she
rises therefore with chanticleer, her dame's cock, and at night makes
the lamb her curfew.  Her breath is her own, which scents all the year
long of June, like a new-made haycock.  She makes her hand hard with
labour, and her heart soft with pity; and when winter evenings fall
early (sitting at her merry wheel) she sings a defiance to the giddy
wheel of Fortune.  She doth all things with so sweet a grace, it seems
ignorance will not suffer her to do ill, being her mind is to do well.
She bestows her year's wages at next fair; and in choosing her garments,
counts no bravery in the world like decency.  The garden and bee-hive are
all her physic and chirurgery, and she lives the longer for't.  She dares
go alone, and unfold sheep in the night, and fears no manner of ill,
because she means none: yet, to say the truth, she is never alone, for
she is still accompanied with old songs, honest thoughts, and prayers,
but short ones; yet they have their efficacy, in that they are not
palled with ensuing idle cogitations.  Lastly, her dreams are so chaste,
that she dare tell them; only a Friday's dream is all her superstition;
that she conceals for fear of anger.  Thus lives she; and all her care is
she may die in the spring-time, to have store of flowers stuck upon her
winding-sheet."

The love of the country has been sung by poets, and echoed by
philosophers; but the first have not attempted, and the last have been
greatly puzzled to account for it.  I do not know that any one has ever
explained, satisfactorily, the true source of this feeling, or of that
soothing emotion which the sight of the country, or a lively description
of rural objects hardly ever fails to infuse into the mind.  Some have
ascribed this feeling to the natural beauty of the objects themselves;
others to the freedom from care, the silence and tranquillity which
scenes of retirement afford; others to the healthy and innocent
employments of a country life; others to the simplicity of country
manners, and others to a variety of different causes; but none to the
right one.  All these, indeed, have their effect; but there is another
principal one which has not been touched upon, or only slightly glanced
at.  I will not, however, imitate Mr. Horne Tooke, who after enumerating
seventeen different definitions of the verb, and laughing at them all as
deficient and nugatory, at the end of two quarto volumes does not tell
us what the verb really is, and has left posterity to pluck out "the
heart of his mystery." I will say at once what it is that distinguishes
this interest from others, and that is its _abstractedness_.  The
interest we feel in human nature is exclusive, and confined to the
individual; the interest we feel in external nature is common, and
transferable from one object to all others of the same class.  Thus.

Rousseau in his Confessions relates, that when he took possession of
his room at Annecy, he found that he could see "a little spot of green"
from his window, which endeared his situation the more to him, because,
he says, it was the first time he had had this object constantly before
him since he left Boissy, the place where he was at school when a child.
[7] Some such feeling as that here described will be found lurking at
the bottom of all our attachments of this sort.  Were it not for the
recollections habitually associated with them, natural objects could not
interest the mind in the manner they do.  No doubt, the sky is beautiful,
the clouds sail majestically along its bosom; the sun is cheering; there
is something exquisitely graceful in the manner in which a plant or tree
puts forth its branches; the motion with which they bend and tremble in
the evening breeze is soft and lovely; there is music in the babbling of
a brook; the view from the top of a mountain is full of grandeur; nor
can we behold the ocean with indifference.  Or, as the Minstrel sweetly
sings,

      "Oh, how canst thou renounce the boundless store
        Of charms which Nature to her votary yields!
      The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,
        The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;
      All that the genial ray of morning gilds,
        And all that echoes to the song of even,
      All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields,
        And all the dread magnificence of heaven,
      Oh, how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!"

[7] Pope also declares that he had a particular regard for an old post
which stood in the court-yard before the house where he was brought up.

It is not, however, the beautiful and magnificent alone that we
admire in Nature; the most insignificant and rudest objects are often
found connected with the strongest emotions; we become attached to the
most common and familiar images, as to the face of a friend whom we have
long known, and from whom we have received many benefits.  It is because
natural objects have been associated with the sports of our childhood,
with air and exercise, with our feelings in solitude, when the mind
takes the strongest hold of things, and clings with the fondest interest
to whatever strikes its attention; with change of place, the pursuit of
new scenes, and thoughts of distant friends; it is because they have
surrounded us in almost all situations, in joy and in sorrow, in
pleasure and in pain; because they have been one chief source and
nourishment of our feelings, and a part of our being, that we love them
as we do ourselves.

There is, generally speaking, the same foundation for our love of
Nature as for all our habitual attachments, namely, association of
ideas.  But this is not all.  That which distinguishes this attachment
from others is the transferable nature of our feelings with respect to
physical objects; the associations connected with any one object
extending to the whole class.  Our having been attached to any particular
person does not make us feel the same attachment to the next person we
may chance to meet; but, if we have once associated strong feelings of
delight with the objects of natural scenery, the tie becomes
indissoluble, and we shall ever after feel the same attachment to other
objects of the same sort.  I remember when I was abroad, the trees, and
grass, and wet leaves, rustling in the walks of the Thuilleries, seemed
to be as much English, to be as much the same trees and grass, that I
had always been used to, as the sun shining over my head was the same
sun which I saw in England; the faces only were foreign to me.  Whence
comes this difference? It arises from our always imperceptibly
connecting the idea of the individual with man, and only the idea of the
class with natural objects.  In the one case, the external appearance or
physical structure is the least thing to be attended to; in the other,
it is every thing.  The springs that move the human form, and make it
friendly or adverse to me, lie hid within it.  There is an infinity of
motives, passions, and ideas, contained in that narrow compass, of which
I know nothing, and in which I have no share.  Each individual is a world
to himself, governed by a thousand contradictory and wayward impulses.  I
can, therefore, make no inference from one individual to another; nor
can my habitual sentiments, with respect to any individual, extend
beyond himself to others.  A crowd of people presents a disjointed,
confused, and unsatisfactory appearance to the eye, because there is
nothing to connect the motley assemblage into one continuous or general
impression, unless when there is some common object of interest to fix
their attention, as in the case of a full pit at the play-house.  The
same principle will also account for that feeling of littleness,
vacuity, and perplexity, which a stranger feels on entering the streets
of a populous city.  Every individual he meets is a blow to his personal
identity.  Every new face is a teazing, unanswered riddle.  He feels the
same wearisome sensation in walking from Oxford Street to Temple Bar, as
a person would do who should be compelled to read through the first leaf
of all the volumes in a library.  But it is otherwise with respect to
nature.  A flock of sheep is not a contemptible, but a beautiful sight.
The greatest number and variety of physical objects do not puzzle the
will, or distract the attention, but are massed together under one
uniform and harmonious feeling.  The heart reposes in greater security on
the immensity of Nature's works, "expatiates freely there," and finds
elbow room and breathing space.  We are always at home with Nature.  There
is neither hypocrisy, caprice, nor mental reservation in her favours.
Our intercourse with her is not liable to accident or change, suspicion
or disappointment: she smiles on us still the same.  A rose is always
sweet, a lily is always beautiful: we do not hate the one, nor envy the
other.  If we have once enjoyed the cool shade of a tree, and been lulled
into a deep repose by the sound of a brook running at its foot, we are
sure that wherever we can find a shady stream, we can enjoy the same
pleasure again; so that when we imagine these objects, we can easily
form a mystic personification of the friendly power that inhabits them,
Dryad or Naiad, offering its cool fountain or its tempting shade.  Hence
the origin of the Grecian mythology.  All objects of the same kind being
the same, not only in their appearance, but in their practical uses, we
habitually confound them together under the same general idea; and
whatever fondness we may have conceived for one, is immediately placed
to the common account.  The most opposite kinds and remote trains of
feeling gradually go to enrich the same sentiment; and in our love of
nature, there is all the force of individual attachment, combined with
the most airy abstraction.  It is this circumstance which gives that
refinement, expansion, and wild interest, to feelings of this sort, when
strongly excited, which every one must have experienced who is a true
lover of nature.

It is the same setting sun that we see and remember year after year,
through summer and winter, seed-time and harvest.  The moon that shines
above our heads, or plays through the checquered shade, is the same moon
that we used to read of in Mrs. Radcliffe's romances.  We see no
difference in the trees first covered with leaves in the spring.  The dry
reeds rustling on the side of a stream--the woods swept by the loud
blast--the dark massy foliage of autumn--the grey trunks and naked
branches of the trees in winter--the sequestered copse, and
wide-extended heath--the glittering sunny showers, and December snows
--are still the same, or accompanied with the same thoughts and
feelings: there is no object, however trifling or rude, that does not in
some mood or other find its way into the heart, as a link in the chain
of our living being; and this it is that makes good that saying of the
poet--

      "To me the meanest flower that blows can give
      Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."

Thus nature is a kind of universal home, and every object it presents to
us an old acquaintance with unaltered looks; for there is that consent
and mutual harmony among all her works, one undivided spirit pervading
them throughout, that to him who has well acquainted himself with them,
they speak always the same well-known language, striking on the heart,
amidst unquiet thoughts and the tumult of the world, like the music of
one's native tongue heard in some far-off country.

      "My heart leaps up when I behold
      A rainbow in the sky:
      So was it when my life began,
      So is it now I am a man,
      So shall it be when I grow old and die.
      The child's the father of the man,
      And I would have my years to be
      Linked each to each by natural piety."

The daisy that first strikes the child's eye in trying to leap over
his own shadow, is the same flower that with timid upward glance
implores the grown man not to tread upon it.  Rousseau, in one of his
botanical excursions, meeting with the periwinkle, fell upon his knees,
crying out--_Ah! voila de la pervenche!_ It was because he had thirty
years before brought home the same flower with him in one of his rambles
with Madame de Warens, near Chambery.  It struck him as the same
identical little blue flower that he remembered so well; and thirty
years of sorrow and bitter regret were effaced from his memory.  That, or
a thousand other flowers of the same name, were the same to him, to the
heart, and to the eye; but there was but one Madame Warens in the world,
whose image was never absent from his thoughts; with whom flowers and
verdure sprung up beneath his feet, and without whom all was cold and
barren in nature and in his own breast.  The cuckoo, "that wandering
voice," that comes and goes with the spring, mocks our ears with one
note from youth to age; and the lapwing, screaming round the traveller's
path, repeats for ever the same sad story of Tereus and Philomel!




LECTURE VI.
ON SWIFT, YOUNG, GRAY, COLLINS, &c.


I shall in the present Lecture go back to the age of Queen Anne, and
endeavour to give a cursory account of the most eminent of our poets, of
whom I have not already spoken, from that period to the present.

The three principal poets among the wits of Queen Anne's reign, next
to Pope, were Prior, Swift, and Gay.  Parnell, though a good-natured,
easy man, and a friend to poets and the Muses, was himself little more
than an occasional versifier; and Arbuthnot, who had as much wit as the
best of them, chose to shew it in prose, and not in verse.  He had a very
notable share in the immortal History of John Bull, and the inimitable
and praiseworthy Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus.  There has been a great
deal said and written about the plagiarisms of Sterne; but the only real
plagiarism he has been guilty of (if such theft were a crime), is in
taking Tristram Shandy's father from Martin's, the elder Scriblerus.  The
original idea of the character, that is, of the opinionated, captious
old gentleman, who is pedantic, not from profession, but choice, belongs
to Arbuthnot.--Arbuthnot's style is distinguished from that of his
contemporaries, even by a greater degree of terseness and conciseness.
He leaves out every superfluous word; is sparing of connecting
particles, and introductory phrases; uses always the simplest forms of
construction; and is more a master of the idiomatic peculiarities and
internal resources of the language than almost any other writer.  There
is a research in the choice of a plain, as well as of an ornamented or
learned style; and, in fact, a great deal more.  Among common English
words, there may be ten expressing the same thing with different degrees
of force and propriety, and only one of them the very word we want,
because it is the only one that answers exactly with the idea we have in
our minds.  Each word in familiar use has a different set of associations
and shades of meaning attached to it, and distinguished from each other
by inveterate custom; and it is in having the whole of these at our
command, and in knowing which to choose, as they are called for by the
occasion, that the perfection of a pure conversational prose-style
consists.  But in writing a florid and artificial style, neither the same
range of invention, nor the same quick sense of propriety--nothing but
learning is required.  If you know the words, and their general meaning,
it is sufficient: it is impossible you should know the nicer inflections
of signification, depending on an endless variety of application, in
expressions borrowed from a foreign or dead language.  They all impose
upon the ear alike, because they are not familiar to it; the only
distinction left is between the pompous and the plain; the
_sesquipedalia verba_ have this advantage, that they are all of one
length; and any words are equally fit for a learned style, so that we
have never heard them before.  Themistocles thought that the same
sounding epithets could not suit all subjects, as the same dress does
not fit all persons.  The style of our modern prose writers is very fine
in itself; but it wants variety of inflection and adaptation; it hinders
us from seeing the differences of the things it undertakes to describe.

What I have here insisted on will be found to be the leading
distinction between the style of Swift, Arbuthnot, Steele, and the other
writers of the age of Queen Anne, and the style of Dr. Johnson, which
succeeded to it.  The one is English, and the other is not.  The writers
first mentioned, in order to express their thoughts, looked about them
for the properest word to convey any idea, that the language which they
spoke, and which their countrymen understood, afforded: Dr. Johnson
takes the first English word that offers, and by translating it at a
venture into the first Greek or Latin word he can think of, only
retaining the English termination, produces an extraordinary effect upon
the reader, by much the same sort of mechanical process that Trim
converted the old jack-boots into a pair of new mortars.

Dr. Johnson was a lazy learned man, who liked to think and talk,
better than to read or write; who, however, wrote much and well, but too
often by rote.  His long compound Latin phrases required less thought,
and took up more room than others.  What shews the facilities afforded by
this style of imposing generalization, is, that it was instantly adopted
with success by all those who were writers by profession, or who were
not; and that at present, we cannot see a lottery puff or a quack
advertisement pasted against a wall, that is not perfectly Johnsonian in
style.  Formerly, the learned had the privilege of translating their
notions into Latin; and a great privilege it was, as it confined the
reputation and emoluments of learning to themselves.  Dr. Johnson may be
said to have naturalised this privilege, by inventing a sort of jargon
translated half-way out of one language into the other, which raised the
Doctor's reputation, and confounded all ranks in literature.

In the short period above alluded to, authors professed to write as
other men spoke; every body now affects to speak as authors write; and
any one who retains the use of his mother tongue, either in writing or
conversation, is looked upon as a very illiterate character.

Prior and Gay belong, in the characteristic excellences of their
style, to the same class of writers with Suckling, Rochester, and
Sedley: the former imbibed most of the licentious levity of the age of
Charles II. and carried it on beyond the Revolution under King William.
Prior has left no single work equal to Gay's Fables, or the Beggar's
Opera.  But in his lyrical and fugitive pieces he has shown even more
genius, more playfulness, more mischievous gaiety.  No one has exceeded
him in the laughing grace with which he glances at a subject that will
not bear examining, with which he gently hints at what cannot be
directly insisted on, with which he half conceals, and half draws aside
the veil from some of the Muses' nicest mysteries.  His Muse is, in fact,
a giddy wanton flirt, who spends her time in playing at snap-dragon and
blind-man's buff, who tells what she should not, and knows more than she
tells.  She laughs at the tricks she shews us, and blushes, or would be
thought to do so, at what she keeps concealed.  Prior has translated
several of Fontaine's Tales from the French; and they have lost nothing
in the translation, either of their wit or malice.  I need not name them:
but the one I like the most, is that of Cupid in search of Venus's
doves.  No one could insinuate a knavish plot, a tender point, a loose
moral, with such unconscious archness, and careless raillery, as if he
gained new self-possession and adroitness from the perplexity and
confusion into which he throws scrupulous imaginations, and knew how to
seize on all the ticklish parts of his subject, from their involuntarily
shrinking under his grasp.  Some of his imitations of Boileau's servile
addresses to Louis XIV. which he has applied with a happy mixture of wit
and patriotic enthusiasm to King William, or as he familiarly calls him,
to

      "Little Will, the scourge of France,
      No Godhead, but the first of men,"

are excellent, and shew the same talent for _double-entendre_ and the
same gallantry of spirit, whether in the softer lyric, or the more
lively heroic.  Some of Prior's _bon mots_ are the best that are
recorded.--His serious poetry, as his _Solomon_, is as heavy as his
familiar style was light and agreeable.  His moral Muse is a Magdalen,
and should not have obtruded herself on public view.  Henry and Emma is a
paraphrase of the old ballad of the Nut-brown Maid, and not so good as
the original.  In short, as we often see in other cases, where men thwart
their own genius, Prior's sentimental and romantic productions are mere
affectation, the result not of powerful impulse or real feeling, but of
a consciousness of his deficiencies, and a wish to supply their place by
labour and art.

Gay was sometimes grosser than Prior, not systematically, but
inadvertently--from not being so well aware of what he was about; nor
was there the same necessity for caution, for his grossness is by no
means so seductive or inviting.

Gay's Fables are certainly a work of great merit, both as to the
quantity of invention implied, and as to the elegance and facility of
the execution.  They are, however, spun out too long; the descriptions
and narrative are too diffuse and desultory; and the moral is sometimes
without point.  They are more like Tales than Fables.  The best are,
perhaps, the Hare with Many Friends, the Monkeys, and the Fox at the
Point of Death.  His Pastorals are pleasing and poetical.  But his capital
work is his Beggar's Opera.  It is indeed a masterpiece of wit and
genius, not to say of morality.  In composing it, he chose a very
unpromising ground to work upon, and he has prided himself in adorning
it with all the graces, the precision, and brilliancy of style.  It is a
vulgar error to call this a vulgar play.  So far from it, that I do not
scruple to say that it appears to me one of the most refined productions
in the language.  The elegance of the composition is in exact proportion
to the coarseness of the materials: by "happy alchemy of mind," the
author has extracted an essence of refinement from the dregs of human
life, and turns its very dross into gold.  The scenes, characters, and
incidents are, in themselves, of the lowest and most disgusting kind:
but, by the sentiments and reflections which are put into the mouths of
highwaymen, turnkeys, their mistresses, wives, or daughters, he has
converted this motley group into a set of fine gentlemen and ladies,
satirists and philosophers.  He has also effected this transformation
without once violating probability, or "o'erstepping the modesty of
nature." In fact, Gay has turned the tables on the critics; and by the
assumed licence of the mock-heroic style, has enabled himself to _do
justice to nature_, that is, to give all the force, truth, and locality
of real feeling to the thoughts and expressions, without being called to
the bar of false taste and affected delicacy.  The extreme beauty and
feeling of the song, "Woman is like the fair flower in its lustre," are
only equalled by its characteristic propriety and _naivete_.  _Polly_
describes her lover going to the gallows, with the same touching
simplicity, and with all the natural fondness of a young girl in her
circumstances, who sees in his approaching catastrophe nothing but the
misfortunes and the personal accomplishments of the object of her
affections.  "I see him sweeter than the nosegay in his hand; the
admiring crowd lament that so lovely a youth should come to an untimely
end:--even butchers weep, and Jack Ketch refuses his fee rather than
consent to tie the fatal knot." The preservation of the character and
costume is complete.  It has been said by a great authority--"There is
some soul of goodness in things evil":--and the _Beggar's Opera_ is a
good-natured but instructive comment on this text.  The poet has thrown
all the gaiety and sunshine of the imagination, all the intoxication of
pleasure, and the vanity of despair, round the shortlived existence of
his heroes; while _Peachum_ and _Lockitt_ are seen in the back-ground,
parcelling out their months and weeks between them.  The general view
exhibited of human life is of the most subtle and abstracted kind.  The
author has, with great felicity, brought out the good qualities and
interesting emotions almost inseparable from the lowest conditions; and
with the same penetrating glance, has detected the disguises which rank
and circumstances lend to exalted vice.  Every line in this sterling
comedy sparkles with wit, and is fraught with the keenest sarcasm.  The
very wit, however, takes off from the offensiveness of the satire; and I
have seen great statesmen, very great statesmen, heartily enjoying the
joke, laughing most immoderately at the compliments paid to them as not
much worse than pickpockets and cut-throats in a different line of life,
and pleased, as it were, to see themselves humanised by some sort of
fellowship with their kind.  Indeed, it may be said that the moral of the
piece is _to shew the vulgarity of vice_; or that the same violations of
integrity and decorum, the same habitual sophistry in palliating their
want of principle, are common to the great and powerful, with the
meanest and most contemptible of the species.  What can be more
convincing than the arguments used by these would-be politicians, to
shew that in hypocrisy, selfishness, and treachery, they do not come up
to many of their betters? The exclamation of _Mrs. Peachum_, when her
daughter marries _Macheath_, "Hussy, hussy, you will be as ill used, and
as much neglected, as if you had married a lord," is worth all Miss
Hannah More's laboured invectives on the laxity of the manners of high
life!

I shall conclude this account of Gay with his verses on Sir Richard
Blackmore, which may serve at once as a specimen of his own manner, and
as a character of a voluminous contemporary poet, who was admired by Mr.
Locke, and knighted by King William III.

        "See who ne'er was nor will be half-read,
      Who first sung Arthur, then sung Alfred;
      Praised great Eliza in God's anger,
      Till all true Englishmen cried, 'Hang her!'--
      Maul'd human wit in one thick satire;
      Next in three books spoil'd human nature:
      Undid Creation at a jerk,
      And of Redemption made damn'd work.
      Then took his Muse at once, and dipt her
      Full in the middle of the Scripture.
      What wonders there the man, grown old, did?
      Sternhold himself he out Sternholded.
      Made David seem so mad and freakish,
      All thought him just what thought King Achish.
      No mortal read his Solomon
      But judg'd Re'boam his own son.
      Moses he serv'd as Moses Pharaoh,
      And Deborah as she Siserah,
      Made Jeremy full sore to cry,
      And Job himself curse God and die.
      What punishment all this must follow?
      Shall Arthur use him like King Tollo?
      Shall David as Uriah slay him?
      Or dextrous Deborah Siserah him?
      No!--none of these!  Heaven spare his life!
      But send him, honest Job, thy wife!"

Gay's Trivia, or Art of Walking the Streets, is as pleasant as walking
the streets must have been at the time when it was written.  His ballad
of Black Eyed Susan is one of the most delightful that can be imagined;
nor do I see that it is a bit the worse for Mr. Jekyll's parody on it.

Swift's reputation as a poet has been in a manner obscured by the
greater splendour, by the natural force and inventive genius of his
prose writings; but if he had never written either the Tale of a Tub or
Gulliver's Travels, his name merely as a poet would have come down to
us, and have gone down to posterity with well earned honours.  His
Imitations of Horace, and still more his Verses on his own Death, place
him in the first rank of agreeable moralists in verse.  There is not only
a dry humour, an exquisite tone of irony, in these productions of his
pen; but there is a touching, unpretending pathos, mixed up with the
most whimsical and eccentric strokes of pleasantry and satire.  His
Description of the Morning in London, and of a City Shower, which were
first published in the Tatler, are among the most delightful of the
contents of that very delightful work.  Swift shone as one of the most
sensible of the poets; he is also distinguished as one of the most
nonsensical of them.  No man has written so many lack-a-daisical,
slip-shod, tedious, trifling, foolish, fantastical verses as he, which
are so little an imputation on the wisdom of the writer; and which, in
fact, only shew his readiness to oblige others, and to forget himself.
He has gone so far as to invent a new stanza of fourteen and sixteen
syllable lines for Mary the cookmaid to vent her budget of nothings, and
for Mrs. Harris to gossip with the deaf old housekeeper.  Oh, when shall
we have such another Rector of Laracor!--The Tale of a Tub is one of
the most masterly compositions in the language, whether for thought,
wit, or style.  It is so capital and undeniable a proof of the author's
talents, that Dr. Johnson, who did not like Swift, would not allow that
he wrote it.  It is hard that the same performance should stand in the
way of a man's promotion to a bishopric, as wanting gravity, and at the
same time be denied to be his, as having too much wit.  It is a pity the
Doctor did not find out some graver author, for whom he felt a critical
kindness, on whom to father this splendid but unacknowledged production.
Dr. Johnson could not deny that Gulliver's Travels were his; he
therefore disputed their merits, and said that after the first idea of
them was conceived, they were easy to execute; all the rest followed
mechanically.  I do not know how that may be; but the mechanism employed
is something very different from any that the author of Rasselas was in
the habit of bringing to bear on such occasions.  There is nothing more
futile, as well as invidious, than this mode of criticising a work of
original genius.  Its greatest merit is supposed to be in the invention;
and you say, very wisely, that it is not _in the execution_.  You might
as well take away the merit of the invention of the telescope, by saying
that, after its uses were explained and understood, any ordinary
eyesight could look through it.  Whether the excellence of Gulliver's
Travels is in the conception or the execution, is of little consequence;
the power is somewhere, and it is a power that has moved the world.  The
power is not that of big words and vaunting common places.  Swift left
these to those who wanted them; and has done what his acuteness and
intensity of mind alone could enable any one to conceive or to perform.
His object was to strip empty pride and grandeur of the imposing air
which external circumstances throw around them; and for this purpose he
has cheated the imagination of the illusions which the prejudices of
sense and of the world put upon it, by reducing every thing to the
abstract predicament of size.  He enlarges or diminishes the scale, as he
wishes to shew the insignificance or the grossness of our overweening
self-love.  That he has done this with mathematical precision, with
complete presence of mind and perfect keeping, in a manner that comes
equally home to the understanding of the man and of the child, does not
take away from the merit of the work or the genius of the author.  He has
taken a new view of human nature, such as a being of a higher sphere
might take of it; he has torn the scales from off his moral vision; he
has tried an experiment upon human life, and sifted its pretensions from
the alloy of circumstances; he has measured it with a rule, has weighed
it in a balance, and found it, for the most part, wanting and worthless
--in substance and in shew.  Nothing solid, nothing valuable is left in
his system but virtue and wisdom.  What a libel is this upon mankind!
What a convincing proof of misanthropy! What presumption and what
_malice prepense_, to shew men what they are, and to teach them what
they ought to be! What a mortifying stroke aimed at national glory, is
that unlucky incident of Gulliver's wading across the channel and
carrying off the whole fleet of Blefuscu! After that, we have only to
consider which of the contending parties was in the right.  What a shock
to personal vanity is given in the account of Gulliver's nurse
Glumdalclitch! Still, notwithstanding the disparagement to her personal
charms, her good-nature remains the same amiable quality as before.  I
cannot see the harm, the misanthropy, the immoral and degrading tendency
of this.  The moral lesson is as fine as the intellectual exhibition is
amusing.  It is an attempt to tear off the mask of imposture from the
world; and nothing but imposture has a right to complain of it.  It is,
indeed, the way with our quacks in morality to preach up the dignity of
human nature, to pamper pride and hypocrisy with the idle mockeries of
the virtues they pretend to, and which they have not: but it was not
Swift's way to cant morality, or any thing else; nor did his genius
prompt him to write unmeaning panegyrics on mankind!

I do not, therefore, agree with the estimate of Swift's moral or
intellectual character, given by an eminent critic, who does not seem to
have forgotten the party politics of Swift.  I do not carry my political
resentments so far back: I can at this time of day forgive Swift for
having been a Tory.  I feel little disturbance (whatever I might think of
them) at his political sentiments, which died with him, considering how
much else he has left behind him of a more solid and imperishable
nature! If he had, indeed, (like some others) merely left behind him the
lasting infamy of a destroyer of his country, or the shining example of
an apostate from liberty, I might have thought the case altered.

The determination with which Swift persisted in a preconcerted
theory, savoured of the morbid affection of which he died.  There is
nothing more likely to drive a man mad, than the being unable to get rid
of the idea of the distinction between right and wrong, and an
obstinate, constitutional preference of the true to the agreeable.  Swift
was not a Frenchman.  In this respect he differed from Rabelais and
Voltaire.  They have been accounted the three greatest wits in modern
times; but their wit was of a peculiar kind in each.  They are little
beholden to each other; there is some resemblance between Lord Peter in
the Tale of a Tub, and Rabelais' Friar John; but in general they are all
three authors of a substantive character in themselves.  Swift's wit
(particularly in his chief prose works) was serious, saturnine, and
practical; Rabelais' was fantastical and joyous; Voltaire's was light,
sportive, and verbal.  Swift's wit was the wit of sense; Rabelais', the
wit of nonsense; Voltaire's, of indifference to both.  The ludicrous in
Swift arises out of his keen sense of impropriety, his soreness and
impatience of the least absurdity.  He separates, with a severe and
caustic air, truth from falsehood, folly from wisdom, "shews vice her
own image, scorn her own feature"; and it is the force, the precision,
and the honest abruptness with which the separation is made, that
excites our surprise, our admiration, and laughter.  He sets a mark of
reprobation on that which offends good sense and good manners, which
cannot be mistaken, and which holds it up to our ridicule and contempt
ever after.  His occasional disposition to trifling (already noticed) was
a relaxation from the excessive earnestness of his mind.  _Indignatio
facit versus_.  His better genius was his spleen.  It was the biting
acrimony of his temper that sharpened his other faculties.  The truth of
his perceptions produced the pointed coruscations of his wit; his
playful irony was the result of inward bitterness of thought; his
imagination was the product of the literal, dry, incorrigible
tenaciousness of his understanding.  He endeavoured to escape from the
persecution of realities into the regions of fancy, and invented his
Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians, Yahoos, and Houynhyms, as a diversion
to the more painful knowledge of the world around him: _they_ only made
him laugh, while men and women made him angry.  His feverish impatience
made him view the infirmities of that great baby the world, with the
same scrutinizing glance and jealous irritability that a parent regards
the failings of its offspring; but, as Rousseau has well observed,
parents have not on this account been supposed to have more affection
for other people's children than their own.  In other respects, and
except from the sparkling effervescence of his gall, Swift's brain was
as "dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage." He hated absurdity--
Rabelais loved it, exaggerated it with supreme satisfaction, luxuriated
in its endless varieties, rioted in nonsense, "reigned there and
revelled." He dwelt on the absurd and ludicrous for the pleasure they
gave him, not for the pain.  He lived upon laughter, and died laughing.
He indulged his vein, and took his full swing of folly.  He did not baulk
his fancy or his readers.  His wit was to him "as riches fineless"; he
saw no end of his wealth in that way, and set no limits to his
extravagance: he was communicative, prodigal, boundless, and
inexhaustible.  His were the Saturnalia of wit, the riches and the
royalty, the health and long life.  He is intoxicated with gaiety, mad
with folly.  His animal spirits drown him in a flood of mirth: his blood
courses up and down his veins like wine.  His thirst of enjoyment is as
great as his thirst of drink: his appetite for good things of all sorts
is unsatisfied, and there is a never-ending supply.  _Discourse is dry_;
so they moisten their words in their cups, and relish their dry jests
with plenty of Botargos and dried neats' tongues.  It is like Camacho's
wedding in Don Quixote, where Sancho ladled out whole pullets and fat geese
from the soup-kettles at a pull.  The flagons are setting a running,
their tongues wag at the same time, and their mirth flows as a river.
How Friar John roars and lays about him in the vineyard! How Panurge
whines in the storm, and how dexterously he contrives to throw the
sheep overboard! How much Pantagruel behaves like a wise king! How
Gargantua mewls, and pules [sic], and slabbers his nurse, and demeans
himself most like a royal infant! what provinces he devours! what seas
he drinks up! How he eats, drinks, and sleeps--sleeps, eats, and
drinks! The style of Rabelais is no less prodigious than his matter.  His
words are of marrow, unctuous, dropping fatness.  He was a mad wag, the
king of good fellows, and prince of practical philosophers!

Rabelais was a Frenchman of the old school--Voltaire of the new.
The wit of the one arose from an exuberance of enjoyment--of the
other, from an excess of indifference, real or assumed.  Voltaire had no
enthusiasm for one thing or another: he made light of every thing.  In
his hands all things turn to chaff and dross, as the pieces of silver
money in the Arabian Nights were changed by the hands of the enchanter
into little dry crumbling leaves! He is a Parisian.  He never
exaggerates, is never violent: he treats things with the most provoking
_sang froid_; and expresses his contempt by the most indirect hints, and
in the fewest words, as if he hardly thought them worth even his
contempt.  He retains complete possession of himself and of his subject.
He does not effect his purpose by the eagerness of his blows, but by the
delicacy of his tact.  The poisoned wound he inflicted was so fine, as
scarcely to be felt till it rankled and festered in its "mortal
consequences." His callousness was an excellent foil for the antagonists
he had mostly to deal with.  He took knaves and fools on his shield well.
He stole away its cloak from grave imposture.  If he reduced other things
below their true value, making them seem worthless and hollow, he did
not degrade the pretensions of tyranny and superstition below their true
value, by making them seem utterly worthless and hollow, as contemptible
as they were odious.  This was the service he rendered to truth and
mankind! His _Candide_ is a masterpiece of wit.  It has been called "the
dull product of a scoffer's pen"; it is indeed the "product of a
scoffer's pen"; but after reading the Excursion, few people will think
it _dull_.  It is in the most perfect keeping, and without any appearance
of effort.  Every sentence tells, and the whole reads like one sentence.
There is something sublime in Martin's sceptical indifference to moral
good and evil.  It is the repose of the grave.  It is better to suffer
this living death, than a living martyrdom.  "Nothing can touch him
further." The moral of Candide (such as it is) is the same as that of
Rasselas: the execution is different.  Voltaire says, "A great book is a
great evil." Dr. Johnson would have laboured this short apophthegm into
a voluminous common-place.  Voltaire's traveller (in another work) being
asked "whether he likes black or white mutton best," replies that "he is
indifferent, provided it is tender." Dr. Johnson did not get at a
conclusion by so short a way as this.  If Voltaire's licentiousness is
objected to me, I say, let it be placed to its true account, the manners
of the age and court in which he lived.  The lords and ladies of the
bedchamber in the reign of Louis XV. found no fault with the immoral
tendency of his writings.  Why then should our modern _purists_ quarrel
with them?--But to return.

Young is a gloomy epigrammatist.  He has abused great powers both of
thought and language.  His moral reflections are sometimes excellent; but
he spoils their beauty by overloading them with a religious horror, and
at the same time giving them all the smart turns and quaint expression
of an enigma or repartee in verse.  The well-known lines on
Procrastination are in his best manner:

        "Be wise to-day; 'tis madness to defer;
      Next day the fatal precedent will plead;
      Thus on, till wisdom is push'd out of life.
      Procrastination is the thief of time;
      Year after year it steals, till all are fled,
      And to the mercies of a moment leaves
      The vast concerns of an eternal scene.

        Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears
      The palm, "That all men are about to live,"
      For ever on the brink of being born.
      All pay themselves the compliment to think
      They, one day, shall not drivel; and their pride
      On this reversion takes up ready praise;
      At least, their own; their future selves applauds;
      How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!
      Time lodg'd in their own hands is Folly's vails:
      That lodg'd in Fate's, to Wisdom they consign;
      The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone.
      'Tis not in Folly, not to scorn a fool;
      And scarce in human Wisdom to do more.
      All Promise is poor dilatory man,
      And that through every stage.  When young, indeed,
      In full content we, sometimes, nobly rest,
      Un-anxious for ourselves; and only wish,
      As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.
      At thirty man suspects himself a fool;
      Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;
      At fifty chides his infamous delay,
      Pushes his prudent purpose to Resolve;
      In all the magnanimity of thought
      Resolves, and re-resolves; then dies the same.

        And why?  Because he thinks himself immortal.
      All men think all men mortal, but themselves;
      Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate
      Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread;
      But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,
      Soon close; where past the shaft, no trace is found.
      As from the wing no scar the sky retains;
      The parted wave no furrow from the keel;
      So dies in human hearts the thought of death.
      Ev'n with the tender tear which nature sheds
      O'er those we love, we drop it in their grave."

His Universal Passion is a keen and powerful satire; but the effort
takes from the effect, and oppresses attention by perpetual and violent
demands upon it.  His tragedy of the Revenge is monkish and scholastic.
Zanga is a vulgar caricature of Iago.  The finest lines in it are the
burst of triumph at the end, when his revenge is completed:

      "Let Europe and her pallid sons go weep,
      Let Afric on her hundred thrones rejoice," &c.

Collins is a writer of a very different stamp, who had perhaps less
general power of mind than Young; but he had that true _vivida vis_,
that genuine inspiration, which alone can give birth to the highest
efforts of poetry.  He leaves stings in the minds of his readers, certain
traces of thought and feelings which never wear out, because nature had
left them in his own mind.  He is the only one of the minor poets of
whom, if he had lived, it cannot be said that he might not have done the
greatest things.  The germ is there.  He is sometimes affected, unmeaning,
and obscure; but he also catches rich glimpses of the bowers of
Paradise, and has lofty aspirations after the highest seats of the
Muses.  With a great deal of tinsel and splendid patch-work, he has not
been able to hide the solid sterling ore of genius.  In his best works
there is an attic simplicity, a pathos, and fervour of imagination,
which make us the more lament that the efforts of his mind were at first
depressed by neglect and pecuniary embarrassment, and at length buried
in the gloom of an unconquerable and fatal malady.  How many poets have
gone through all the horrors of poverty and contempt, and ended their
days in moping melancholy or moody madness!

      "We poets in our youth begin in gladness,
      But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness."

Is this the fault of themselves, of nature in tempering them of too fine
a clay, or of the world, that spurner of living, and patron of dead
merit? Read the account of Collins--with hopes frustrated, with
faculties blighted, at last, when it was too late for himself or others,
receiving the deceitful favours of relenting Fortune, which served only
to throw their sunshine on his decay, and to light him to an early
grave.  He was found sitting with every spark of imagination
extinguished, and with only the faint traces of memory and reason left
--with only one book in his room, the Bible; "but that," he said, "was
the best." A melancholy damp hung like an unwholesome mildew upon his
faculties--a canker had consumed the flower of his life.  He produced
works of genius, and the public regarded them with scorn: he aimed at
excellence that should be his own, and his friends treated his efforts
as the wanderings of fatuity.  The proofs of his capacity are, his Ode on
Evening, his Ode on the Passions (particularly the fine personification
of Hope), his Ode to Fear, the Dirge in Cymbeline, the Lines on
Thomson's Grave, and his Eclogues, parts of which are admirable.  But
perhaps his Ode on the Poetical Character is the best of all.  A rich
distilled perfume emanates from it like the breath of genius; a golden
cloud envelopes it; a honeyed paste of poetic diction encrusts it, like
the candied coat of the auricula.  His Ode to Evening shews equal genius
in the images and versification.  The sounds steal slowly over the ear,
like the gradual coming on of evening itself:

      "If aught of oaten stop or pastoral song
      May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy modest ear,
          Like thy own solemn springs,
          Thy springs and dying gales,

      O nymph reserv'd, while now the bright-haired sun
      Sits on yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts
          With brede ethereal wove,
          O'erhang his wavy bed:

      Now air is hush'd, save where the weak-ey'd bat,
      With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing,
          Or where the beetle winds
          His small but sullen horn,

      As oft he rises midst the twilight path,
      Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum.
          Now teach me, maid compos'd,
          To breathe some soften'd strain,

      Whose numbers stealing through thy darkling vale
      May not unseemly with its stillness suit,
          As musing slow, I hail
          Thy genial, lov'd return!

      For when thy folding star arising shews
      His paly circlet, at his warning lamp
          The fragrant Hours and Elves
          Who slept in flow'rs the day,

      And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge,
      And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still,
          The pensive Pleasures sweet
          Prepare thy shadowy car;

      Then lead, calm Votress, where some sheety lake
      Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallow'd pile,
          Or upland fallows grey
          Reflect its last cool gleam.

      But when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain,
      Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut,
          That from the mountain's side
          Views wilds and swelling floods,

      And hamlets brown, and dim discover'd spires,
      And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all
          Thy dewy fingers draw
          The gradual dusky veil.

      While Spring shall pour his show'rs, as oft he wont,
      And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve!
          While Summer loves to sport
          Beneath thy lingering light;

      While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;
      Or Winter yelling through the troublous air,
          Affrights thy shrinking train,
          And rudely rends thy robes;

      So long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed,
      Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lipp'd Health,
          Thy gentlest influence own,
          And hymn thy favourite name."

Hammond, whose poems are bound up with Collins's, in Bell's pocket
edition, was a young gentleman, who appears to have fallen in love about
the year 1740, and who translated Tibullus into English verse, to let
his mistress and the public know of it.

I should conceive that Collins had a much greater poetical genius
than Gray: he had more of that fine madness which is inseparable from
it, of its turbid effervescence, of all that pushes it to the verge of
agony or rapture.  Gray's Pindaric Odes are, I believe, generally given
up at present: they are stately and pedantic, a kind of methodical
borrowed phrenzy.  But I cannot so easily give up, nor will the world be
in any haste to part with his Elegy in a Country Church-yard: it is one
of the most classical productions that ever was penned by a refined and
thoughtful mind, moralising on human life.  Mr. Coleridge (in his
Literary Life) says, that his friend Mr. Wordsworth had undertaken to
shew that the language of the Elegy is unintelligible: it has, however,
been understood! The Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College is more
mechanical and common-place; but it touches on certain strings about the
heart, that vibrate in unison with it to our latest breath.  No one ever
passes by Windsor's "stately heights," or sees the distant spires of
Eton College below, without thinking of Gray.  He deserves that we should
think of him; for he thought of others, and turned a trembling,
ever-watchful ear to "the still sad music of humanity."--His Letters
are inimitably fine.  If his poems are sometimes finical and pedantic,
his prose is quite free from affectation.  He pours his thoughts out upon
paper as they arise in his mind; and they arise in his mind without
pretence, or constraint, from the pure impulse of learned leisure and
contemplative indolence.  He is not here on stilts or in buckram; but
smiles in his easy chair, as he moralises through the loopholes of
retreat, on the bustle and raree-show of the world, or on "those
reverend bedlams, colleges and schools!" He had nothing to do but to
read and to think, and to tell his friends what he read and thought.  His
life was a luxurious, thoughtful dream.  "Be mine," he says in one of his
Letters, "to read eternal new romances of Marivaux and Crebillon." And
in another, to shew his contempt for action and the turmoils of
ambition, he says to someone, "Don't you remember Lords ------ and ------,
who are now great statesmen, little dirty boys playing at cricket? For
my part, I do not feel a bit wiser, or bigger, or older than I did
then." What an equivalent for not being wise or great, to be always
young! What a happiness never to lose or gain any thing in the game of
human life, by being never any thing more than a looker-on!

How different from Shenstone, who only wanted to be looked at: who
withdrew from the world to be followed by the crowd, and courted
popularity by affecting privacy! His Letters shew him to have lived in a
continual fever of petty vanity, and to have been a finished literary
coquet.  He seems always to say, "You will find nothing in the world so
amiable as Nature and me: come, and admire us." His poems are
indifferent and tasteless, except his Pastoral Ballad, his Lines on
Jemmy Dawson, and his School-mistress, which last is a perfect piece of
writing.

Akenside had in him the materials of poetry, but he was hardly a
great poet.  He improved his Pleasures of the Imagination in the
subsequent editions, by pruning away a great many redundances of style
and ornament.  Armstrong is better, though he has not chosen a very
exhilarating subject--The Art of Preserving Health.  Churchill's
Satires on the Scotch, and Characters of the Players, are as good as the
subjects deserved--they are strong, coarse, and full of an air of
hardened assurance.  I ought not to pass over without mention Green's
Poem on the Spleen, or Dyer's Grongar Hill.

The principal name of the period we are now come to is that of
Goldsmith, than which few names stand higher or fairer in the annals of
modern literature.  One should have his own pen to describe him as he
ought to be described--amiable, various, and bland, with careless
inimitable grace touching on every kind of excellence--with manners
unstudied, but a gentle heart--performing miracles of skill from pure
happiness of nature, and whose greatest fault was ignorance of his own
worth.  As a poet, he is the most flowing and elegant of our versifiers
since Pope, with traits of artless nature which Pope had not, and with a
peculiar felicity in his turns upon words, which he constantly repeated
with delightful effect: such as--

        "------His lot, though small,
      He sees that little lot, the lot of all."

      *   *   *   *   *

      "And turn'd and look'd, and turn'd to look again."

As a novelist, his Vicar of Wakefield has charmed all Europe.  What
reader is there in the civilised world, who is not the better for the
story of the washes which the worthy Dr. Primrose demolished so
deliberately with the poker--for the knowledge of the guinea which the
Miss Primroses kept unchanged in their pockets--the adventure of the
picture of the Vicar's family, which could not be got into the house--
and that of the Flamborough family, all painted with oranges in their
hands--or for the story of the case of shagreen spectacles and the
cosmogony?

As a comic writer, his Tony Lumpkin draws forth new powers from Mr.
Liston's face.  That alone is praise enough for it.  Poor Goldsmith! how
happy he has made others! how unhappy he was in himself! He never had
the pleasure of reading his own works! He had only the satisfaction of
good-naturedly relieving the necessities of others, and the consolation
of being harassed to death with his own! He is the most amusing and
interesting person, in one of the most amusing and interesting books in
the world, Boswell's Life of Johnson.  His peach-coloured coat shall
always bloom in Boswell's writings, and his fame survive in his own!--
His genius was a mixture of originality and imitation: he could do
nothing without some model before him, and he could copy nothing that he
did not adorn with the graces of his own mind.  Almost all the latter
part of the Vicar of Wakefield, and a great deal of the former, is taken
from Joseph Andrews; but the circumstances I have mentioned above are
not.

The finest things he has left behind him in verse are his character
of a country school-master, and that prophetic description of Burke in
the Retaliation.  His moral Essays in the Citizen of the World, are as
agreeable chit-chat as can be conveyed in the form of didactic
discourses.

Warton was a poet and a scholar, studious with ease, learned without
affectation.  He had a happiness which some have been prouder of than he,
who deserved it less--he was poet-laureat.

      "And that green wreath which decks the bard when dead,
      That laurel garland crown'd his living head."

But he bore his honours meekly, and performed his half-yearly task
regularly.  I should not have mentioned him for this distinction alone
(the highest which a poet can receive from the state), but for another
circumstance; I mean his being the author of some of the finest sonnets
in the language--at least so they appear to me; and as this species of
composition has the necessary advantage of being short (though it is
also sometimes both "tedious and brief"), I will here repeat two or
three of them, as treating pleasing subjects in a pleasing and
philosophical way.

      _Written in a blank leaf of Dugdale's Monasticon_

      "Deem not, devoid of elegance, the sage,
      By Fancy's genuine feelings unbeguil'd,
      Of painful pedantry the poring child;
      Who turns of these proud domes the historic page,
      Now sunk by Time, and Henry's fiercer rage.
      Think'st thou the warbling Muses never smil'd
      On his lone hours?  Ingenuous views engage
      His thoughts, on themes unclassic falsely styl'd,
      Intent.  While cloister'd piety displays
      Her mouldering roll, the piercing eye explores
      New manners, and the pomp of elder days,
      Whence culls the pensive bard his pictur'd stores.
      Not rough nor barren are the winding ways
      Of hoar Antiquity, but strewn with flowers."

      "Thou noblest monument of Albion's isle,
      Whether, by Merlin's aid, from Scythia's shore
      To Amber's fatal plain Pendragon bore,
      Huge frame of giant hands, the mighty pile,
      T'entomb his Britons slain by Hengist's guile:
      Or Druid priests, sprinkled with human gore,
      Taught mid thy massy maze their mystic lore:
      Or Danish chiefs, enrich'd with savage spoil,
      To victory's idol vast, an unhewn shrine,
      Rear'd the rude heap, or in thy hallow'd ground
      Repose the kings of Brutus' genuine line;
      Or here those kings in solemn state were crown'd;
      Studious to trace thy wondrous origin,
      We muse on many an ancient tale renown'd."

Nothing can be more admirable than the learning here displayed, or the
inference from it, that it is of no use but as it leads to interesting
thought and reflection.

That written after seeing Wilton House is in the same style, but I
prefer concluding with that to the river Lodon, which has a personal as
well as poetical interest about it.

      "Ah! what a weary race my feet have run,
      Since first I trod thy banks with alders crown'd,
      And thought my way was all through fairy ground,
      Beneath the azure sky and golden sun:
      When first my Muse to lisp her notes begun!
      While pensive memory traces back the round
      Which fills the varied interval between;
      Much pleasure, more of sorrow, marks the scene.--
      Sweet native stream! those skies and suns so pure
      No more return, to cheer my evening road!
      Yet still one joy remains, that not obscure
      Nor useless, all my vacant days have flow'd
      From youth's gay dawn to manhood's prime mature,
      Nor with the Muse's laurel unbestow'd."

I have thus gone through all the names of this period I could think
of, but I find that there are others still waiting behind that I had
never thought of.  Here is a list of some of them--Pattison, Tickell,
Hill, Somerville, Browne, Pitt, Wilkie, Dodsley, Shaw, Smart, Langhorne,
Bruce, Greame, Glover, Lovibond, Penrose, Mickle, Jago, Scott,
Whitehead, Jenyns, Logan, Cotton, Cunningham, and Blacklock.--I think
it will be best to let them pass and say nothing about them.  It will be
hard to persuade so many respectable persons that they are dull writers,
and if we give them any praise, they will send others.

But here comes one whose claims cannot be so easily set aside: they
have been sanctioned by learning, hailed by genius, and hallowed by
misfortune--I mean Chatterton.  Yet I must say what I think of him, and
that is not what is generally thought.  I pass over the disputes between
the learned antiquaries, Dr. Mills, Herbert Croft, and Dr. Knox, whether
he was to be placed after Shakspeare and Dryden, or to come after
Shakspeare alone.  A living poet has borne a better testimony to him--

      "I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous boy,
         The sleepless soul that perished in his pride;
      And him [8] who walked in glory and in joy
         Beside his plough along the mountain side."

I am loth to put asunder whom so great an authority has joined together;
but I cannot find in Chatterton's works any thing so extraordinary as
the age at which they were written.  They have a facility, vigour, and
knowledge, which were prodigious in a boy of sixteen, but which would
not have been so in a man of twenty.  He did not shew extraordinary
powers of genius, but extraordinary precocity.  Nor do I believe he would
have written better, had he lived.  He knew this himself, or he would
have lived.  Great geniuses, like great kings, have too much to think of
to kill themselves; for their mind to them also "a kingdom is." With an
unaccountable power coming over him at an unusual age, and with the
youthful confidence it inspired, he performed wonders, and was willing
to set a seal on his reputation by a tragic catastrophe.  He had done his
best; and, like another Empedocles, threw himself into AEtna, to ensure
immortality.  The brazen slippers alone remain!--

LECTURE VII.
ON BURNS, AND THE OLD ENGLISH BALLADS.


I am sorry that what I said in the conclusion of the last Lecture
respecting Chatterton, should have given dissatisfaction to some
persons, with whom I would willingly agree on all such matters.  What I
meant was less to call in question Chatterton's genius, than to object
to the common mode of estimating its magnitude by its prematureness.  The
lists of fame are not filled with the dates of births or deaths; and the
side-mark of the age at which they were done, wears out in works
destined for immortality.  Had Chatterton really done more, we should
have thought less of him, for our attention would then have been fixed
on the excellence of the works themselves, instead of the singularity of
the circumstances in which they were produced.  But because he attained
to the full powers of manhood at an early age, I do not see that he
would have attained to more than those powers, had he lived to be a man.
He was a prodigy, because in him the ordinary march of nature was
violently precipitated; and it is therefore inferred, that he would have
continued to hold on his course, "unslacked of motion." On the contrary,
who knows but he might have lived to be poet-laureat? It is much better
to let him remain as he was.  Of his actual productions, any one may
think as highly as he pleases; I would only guard against adding to the
account of his _quantum meruit_, those possible productions by which the
learned rhapsodists of his time raised his gigantic pretensions to an
equality with those of Homer and Shakspeare.  It is amusing to read some
of these exaggerated descriptions, each rising above the other in
extravagance.  In Anderson's Life, we find that Mr. Warton speaks of him
"as a prodigy of genius," as "a singular instance of prematurity of
abilities": that may be true enough, and Warton was at any rate a
competent judge; but Mr. Malone "believes him to have been the greatest
genius that England has produced since the days of Shakspeare." Dr.
Gregory says, "he must rank, as a universal genius, above Dryden, and
perhaps only second to Shakspeare." Mr. Herbert Croft is still more
unqualified in his praises; he asserts, that "no such being, at any
period of life, has ever been known, or possibly ever will be known." He
runs a parallel between Chatterton and Milton; and asserts, that "an
army of Macedonian and Swedish mad butchers fly before him," meaning, I
suppose, that Alexander the Great and Charles the Twelfth were nothing
to him; "nor," he adds, "does my memory supply me with any human being,
who at such an age, with such advantages, has produced such
compositions.  Under the heathen mythology, superstition and admiration
would have explained all, by bringing Apollo on earth; nor would the God
ever have descended with more credit to himself."--Chatterton's
physiognomy would at least have enabled him to pass _incognito_.  It is
quite different from the look of timid wonder and delight with which
Annibal Caracci has painted a young Apollo listening to the first sounds
he draws from a Pan's pipe, under the tutelage of the old Silenus! If
Mr. Croft is sublime on the occasion, Dr. Knox is no less pathetic.  "The
testimony of Dr. Knox," says Dr. Anderson, (Essays, p. 144.), "does equal
credit to the classical taste and amiable benevolence of the writer, and
the genius and reputation of Chatterton."  "When I read," says the
Doctor, "the researches of those learned antiquaries who have
endeavoured to prove that the poems attributed to Rowley were really
written by him, I observe many ingenious remarks in confirmation of
their opinion, which it would be tedious, if not difficult, to
controvert."

Now this is so far from the mark, that the whole controversy might
have been settled by any one but the learned antiquaries themselves, who
had the smallest share of their learning, from this single circumstance,
that the poems read as smooth as any modern poems, if you read them as
modern compositions; and that you cannot read them, or make verse of
them at all, if you pronounce or accent the words as they were spoken at
the time when the poems were pretended to have been written.  The whole
secret of the imposture, which nothing but a deal of learned dust,
raised by collecting and removing a great deal of learned rubbish, could
have prevented our laborious critics from seeing through, lies on the
face of it (to say nothing of the burlesque air which is scarcely
disguised throughout) in the repetition of a few obsolete words, and in
the mis-spelling of common ones.

"No sooner," proceeds the Doctor, "do I turn to the poems, than the
labour of the antiquaries appears only waste of time; and I am
involuntarily forced to join in placing that laurel, which he seems so
well to have deserved, on the brow of Chatterton.  The poems bear so many
marks of superior genius, that they have deservedly excited the general
attention of polite scholars, and are considered as the most remarkable
productions in modern poetry.  We have many instances of poetical
eminence at an early age; but neither Cowley, Milton, nor Pope, ever
produced any thing while they were boys, which can justly be compared to
the poems of Chatterton.  The learned antiquaries do not indeed dispute
their excellence.  They extol it in the highest terms of applause.  They
raise their favourite Rowley to a rivalry with Homer: but they make the
very merits of the works an argument against their real author.  Is it
possible, say they, that a boy should produce compositions so beautiful
and masterly? That a common boy should produce them is not possible,"
rejoins the Doctor; "but that they should be produced by a boy of an
extraordinary genius, such as was that of Homer or Shakspeare, though a
prodigy, is such a one as by no means exceeds the bounds of rational
credibility."

Now it does not appear that Shakspeare or Homer were such early
prodigies; so that by this reasoning he must take precedence of them
too, as well as of Milton, Cowley, and Pope.  The reverend and classical
writer then breaks out into the following melancholy raptures:--

      "Unfortunate boy! short and evil were thy days, but thy fame shall
be immortal.  Hadst thou been known to the munificent patrons of
genius . . .
      "Unfortunate boy! poorly wast thou accommodated during thy short
sojourning here among us;--rudely wast thou treated--sorely did thy
feelings suffer from the scorn of the unworthy; and there are at last
those who wish to rob thee of thy only meed, thy posthumous glory.
Severe too are the censures of thy morals.  In the gloomy moments of
despondency, I fear thou hast uttered impious and blasphemous thoughts.
But let thy more rigid censors reflect, that thou wast literally and
strictly but a boy.  Let many of thy bitterest enemies reflect what were
their own religious principles, and whether they had any at the age of
fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.  Surely it is a severe and an unjust
surmise that thou wouldst probably have ended thy life as a victim to
the laws, if thou hadst not ended it as thou didst."

Enough, enough, of the learned antiquaries, and of the classical and
benevolent testimony of Dr. Knox. Chatterton was, indeed, badly enough
off; but he was at least saved from the pain and shame of reading this
woful lamentation over fallen genius, which circulates splendidly bound
in the fourteenth edition, while he is a prey to worms.  As to those who
are really capable of admiring Chatterton's genius, or of feeling an
interest in his fate, I would only say, that I never heard any one speak
of any one of his works as if it were an old well-known favourite, and
had become a faith and a religion in his mind.  It is his name, his
youth, and what he might have lived to have done, that excite our wonder
and admiration.  He has the same sort of posthumous fame that an actor of
the last age has--an abstracted reputation which is independent of any
thing we know of his works.  The admirers of Collins never think of him
without recalling to their minds his Ode on Evening, or on the Poetical
Character.  Gray's Elegy, and his poetical popularity, are identified
together, and inseparable even in imagination.  It is the same with
respect to Burns: when you speak of him as a poet, you mean his works,
his Tam o'Shanter, or his Cotter's Saturday Night.  But the enthusiasts
for Chatterton, if you ask for the proofs of his extraordinary genius,
are obliged to turn to the volume, and perhaps find there what they
seek; but it is not in their minds; and it is of _that_ I spoke.  The
Minstrel's song in AElla is I think the best.

To proceed to the more immediate subject of the present Lecture, the
character and writings of Burns.--Shakspeare says of some one, that "he
was like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring." Burns, the poet,
was not such a man.  He had a strong mind, and a strong body, the fellow
to it.  He had a real heart of flesh and blood beating in his bosom--
you can almost hear it throb.  Some one said, that if you had shaken
hands with him, his hand would have burnt yours.  The Gods, indeed, "made
him poetical"; but nature had a hand in him first.  His heart was in the
right place.  He did not "create a soul under the ribs of death," by
tinkling siren sounds, or by piling up centos of poetic diction; but for
the artificial flowers of poetry, he plucked the mountain-daisy under
his feet; and a field-mouse, hurrying from its ruined dwelling, could
inspire him with the sentiments of terror and pity.  He held the plough
or the pen with the same firm, manly grasp; nor did he cut out poetry as
we cut out watch-papers, with finical dexterity, nor from the same
flimsy materials.  Burns was not like Shakspeare in the range of his
genius; but there is something of the same magnanimity, directness, and
unaffected character about him.  He was not a sickly sentimentalist, a
namby-pamby poet, a mincing metre ballad-monger, any more than
Shakspeare.  He would as soon hear "a brazen candlestick tuned, or a dry
wheel grate on the axletree." He was as much of a man--not a twentieth
part as much of a poet as Shakspeare.  With but little of his imagination
or inventive power, he had the same life of mind: within the narrow
circle of personal feeling or domestic incidents, the pulse of his
poetry flows as healthily and vigorously.  He had an eye to see; a heart
to feel:--no more.  His pictures of good fellowship, of social glee, of
quaint humour, are equal to any thing; they come up to nature, and they
cannot go beyond it.  The sly jest collected in his laughing eye at the
sight of the grotesque and ludicrous in manners--the large tear rolled
down his manly cheek at the sight of another's distress.  He has made us
as well acquainted with himself as it is possible to be; has let out the
honest impulses of his native disposition, the unequal conflict of the
passions in his breast, with the same frankness and truth of
description.  His strength is not greater than his weakness: his virtues
were greater than his vices.  His virtues belonged to his genius: his
vices to his situation, which did not correspond to his genius.

It has been usual to attack Burns's moral character, and the moral
tendency of his writings at the same time; and Mr. Wordsworth, in a
letter to Mr. Gray, Master of the High School at Edinburgh, in
attempting to defend, has only laid him open to a more serious and
unheard-of responsibility.  Mr. Gray might very well have sent him back,
in return for his epistle, the answer of Holofernes in Love's Labour's
Lost:--"_Via_ goodman Dull, thou hast spoken no word all this while."
The author of this performance, which is as weak in effect as it is
pompous in pretension, shews a great dislike of Robespierre, Buonaparte,
and of Mr. Jeffrey, whom he, by some unaccountable fatality, classes
together as the three most formidable enemies of the human race that
have appeared in his (Mr. Wordsworth's) remembrance; but he betrays very
little liking to Burns.  He is, indeed, anxious to get him out of the
unhallowed clutches of the Edinburgh Reviewers (as a mere matter of
poetical privilege), only to bring him before a graver and higher
tribunal, which is his own; and after repeating and insinuating
ponderous charges against him, shakes his head, and declines giving any
opinion in so tremendous a case; so that though the judgment of the
former critic is set aside, poor Burns remains just where he was, and
nobody gains any thing by the cause but Mr. Wordsworth, in an increasing
opinion of his own wisdom and purity.  "Out upon this half-faced
fellowship!" The author of the Lyrical Ballads has thus missed a fine
opportunity of doing Burns justice and himself honour.  He might have
shewn himself a philosophical prose-writer, as well as a philosophical
poet.  He might have offered as amiable and as gallant a defence of the
Muses, as my uncle Toby, in the honest simplicity of his heart, did of
the army.  He might have said at once, instead of making a parcel of wry
faces over the matter, that Burns had written Tam o'Shanter, and that
that alone was enough; that he could hardly have described the excesses
of mad, hairbrained, roaring mirth and convivial indulgence, which are
the soul of it, if he himself had not "drunk full ofter of the ton than
of the well"--unless "the act and practique part of life had been the
mistress of his theorique." Mr. Wordsworth might have quoted such lines
as--

      "The landlady and Tam grew gracious,
      Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious";--

or,

      "Care, mad to see a man so happy,
      E'en drown'd himself among the nappy";--

and fairly confessed that he could not have written such lines from a
want of proper habits and previous sympathy; and that till some great
puritanical genius should arise to do these things equally well without
any knowledge of them, the world might forgive Burns the injuries he had
done his health and fortune in his poetical apprenticeship to
experience, for the pleasure he had afforded them.  Instead of this, Mr.
Wordsworth hints, that with different personal habits and greater
strength of mind, Burns would have written differently, and almost as
well as _he_ does.  He might have taken that line of Gay's,

      "The fly that sips treacle is lost in the sweets,"--

and applied it in all its force and pathos to the poetical character.  He
might have argued that poets are men of genius, and that a man of genius
is not a machine; that they live in a state of intellectual
intoxication, and that it is too much to expect them to be distinguished
by peculiar _sang froid_, circumspection, and sobriety.  Poets are by
nature men of stronger imagination and keener sensibilities than others;
and it is a contradiction to suppose them at the same time governed only
by the cool, dry, calculating dictates of reason and foresight.  Mr.
Wordsworth might have ascertained the boundaries that part the provinces
of reason and imagination:--that it is the business of the
understanding to exhibit things in their relative proportions and
ultimate consequences--of the imagination to insist on their immediate
impressions, and to indulge their strongest impulses; but it is the
poet's office to pamper the imagination of his readers and his own with
the extremes of present ecstacy or agony, to snatch the swift-winged
golden minutes, the torturing hour, and to banish the dull, prosaic,
monotonous realities of life, both from his thoughts and from his
practice.  Mr. Wordsworth might have shewn how it is that all men of
genius, or of originality and independence of mind, are liable to
practical errors, from the very confidence their superiority inspires,
which makes them fly in the face of custom and prejudice, always rashly,
sometimes unjustly; for, after all, custom and prejudice are not without
foundation in truth and reason, and no one individual is a match for the
world in power, very few in knowledge.  The world may altogether be set
down as older and wiser than any single person in it.

Again, our philosophical letter-writer might have enlarged on the
temptations to which Burns was exposed from his struggles with fortune
and the uncertainty of his fate.  He might have shewn how a poet, not
born to wealth or title, was kept in a constant state of feverish
anxiety with respect to his fame and the means of a precarious
livelihood: that "from being chilled with poverty, steeped in contempt,
he had passed into the sunshine of fortune, and was lifted to the very
pinnacle of public favour"; yet even there could not count on the
continuance of success, but was, "like the giddy sailor on the mast,
ready with every blast to topple down into the fatal bowels of the
deep!" He might have traced his habit of ale-house tippling to the last
long precious draught of his favourite usquebaugh, which he took in the
prospect of bidding farewel for ever to his native land; and his
conjugal infidelities to his first disappointment in love, which would
not have happened to him, if he had been born to a small estate in land,
or bred up behind a counter!

Lastly, Mr. Wordsworth might have shewn the incompatibility between
the Muses and the Excise, which never agreed well together, or met in
one seat, till they were unaccountably reconciled on Rydal Mount.  He
must know (no man better) the distraction created by the opposite calls
of business and of fancy, the torment of extents, the plague of receipts
laid in order or mislaid, the disagreeableness of exacting penalties or
paying the forfeiture; and how all this (together with the broaching of
casks and the splashing of beer-barrels) must have preyed upon a mind
like Burns, with more than his natural sensibility and none of his
acquired firmness.

Mr. Coleridge, alluding to this circumstance of the promotion of the
Scottish Bard to be "a gauger of ale-firkins," in a poetical epistle to
his friend Charles Lamb, calls upon him in a burst of heartfelt
indignation, to gather a wreath of henbane, nettles, and nightshade,

                         "------To twine
      The illustrious brow of Scotch nobility."

If, indeed, Mr. Lamb had undertaken to write a letter in defence of
Burns, how different would it have been from this of Mr. Wordsworth's!
How much better than I can even imagine it to have been done!

It is hardly reasonable to look for a hearty or genuine defence of
Burns from the pen of Mr. Wordsworth; for there is no common link of
sympathy between them.  Nothing can be more different or hostile than the
spirit of their poetry.  Mr. Wordsworth's poetry is the poetry of mere
sentiment and pensive contemplation: Burns's is a very highly sublimated
essence of animal existence.  With Burns, "self-love and social are the
same"--

      "And we'll tak a cup of kindness yet,
      For auld lang syne."

Mr. Wordsworth is "himself alone," a recluse philosopher, or a reluctant
spectator of the scenes of many-coloured life; moralising on them, not
describing, not entering into them.  Robert Burns has exerted all the
vigour of his mind, all the happiness of his nature, in exalting the
pleasures of wine, of love, and good fellowship: but in Mr. Wordsworth
there is a total disunion and divorce of the faculties of the mind from
those of the body; the banns are forbid, or a separation is austerely
pronounced from bed and board--_a mensa et thoro_.  From the Lyrical
Ballads, it does not appear that men eat or drink, marry or are given in
marriage.  If we lived by every sentiment that proceeded out of mouths,
and not by bread or wine, or if the species were continued like trees
(to borrow an expression from the great Sir Thomas Brown), Mr.
Wordsworth's poetry would be just as good as ever.  It is not so with
Burns: he is "famous for the keeping of it up," and in his verse is ever
fresh and gay.  For this, it seems, he has fallen under the displeasure
of the Edinburgh Reviewers, and the still more formidable patronage of
Mr. Wordsworth's pen.

      "This, this was the unkindest cut of all."

I was going to give some extracts out of this composition in support
of what I have said, but I find them too tedious.  Indeed (if I may be
allowed to speak my whole mind, under correction) Mr. Wordsworth could
not be in any way expected to tolerate or give a favourable
interpretation to Burns's constitutional foibles--even his best
virtues are not good enough for him.  He is repelled and driven back into
himself, not less by the worth than by the faults of others.  His taste
is as exclusive and repugnant as his genius.  It is because so few things
give him pleasure, that he gives pleasure to so few people.  It is not
every one who can perceive the sublimity of a daisy, or the pathos to be
extracted from a withered thorn!

To proceed from Burns's patrons to his poetry, than which no two
things can be more different.  His "Twa Dogs" is a very spirited piece of
description, both as it respects the animal and human creation, and
conveys a very vivid idea of the manners both of high and low life.  The
burlesque panegyric of the first dog,

      "His locked, lettered, braw brass collar
      Shew'd him the gentleman and scholar"--

reminds one of Launce's account of his dog Crabbe, where he is said, as
an instance of his being in the way of promotion, "to have got among
three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table." The
"Halloween" is the most striking and picturesque description of local
customs and scenery.  The Brigs of Ayr, the Address to a Haggis, Scotch
Drink, and innumerable others are, however, full of the same kind of
characteristic and comic painting.  But his master-piece in this way is
his Tam o'Shanter.  I shall give the beginning of it, but I am afraid I
shall hardly know when to leave off.

        "When chapman billies leave the street,
      And drouthy neebors, neebors meet,
      As market-days are wearing late,
      And folk begin to tak the gate;
      While we sit bousing at the nappy,
      And getting fou and unco happy,
      We think na on the lang Scots miles,
      The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,
      That lie between us and our hame,
      Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame,
      Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
      Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.

        This truth fand honest Tam o'Shanter,
      As he frae Ayr ae night did canter;
      (Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses,
      For honest men and bonny lasses.)

        O Tam! hadst thou but been sae wise,
      As ta'en thy ain wife Kate's advice!
      She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,
      A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum;
      That frae November till October
      Ae market-day thou was na sober;
      That ilka melder, wi' the miller,
      Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;
      That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on,
      The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;
      That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday,
      Thou drank wi' Kirton Jean till Monday--
      She prophesy'd, that late or soon,
      Thou wad be found deep drown'd in Doon;
      Or catch't wi' warlocks in the mirk,
      By Alloway's auld haunted kirk.

        Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet,
      To think how mony counsels sweet,
      How mony lengthen'd, sage advices,
      The husband frae the wife despises!

        But to our tale: Ae market night,
      Tam had got planted unco right
      Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,
      Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely;
      And at his elbow, Souter Johnny,
      His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony;
      Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither;
      They had been fou for weeks thegither.
      The night drave on wi' sangs an clatter,
      And aye the ale was growing better:
      The landlady and Tam grew gracious
      Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious:
      The Souter tauld his queerest stories;
      The landlord's laugh was ready chorus:
      The storm without might rair and rustle,
      Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.

        Care, mad to see a man sae happy,
      E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy;
      As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,
      The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure:
      Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,
      O'er a' the ills of life victorious!

        But pleasures are like poppies spread,
      You seize the flow'r--its bloom is shed;
      Or like the snow, falls in the river,
      A moment white--then melts for ever;
      Or like the Borealis race,
      That flit ere you can point their place;
      Or like the rainbow's lovely form,
      Evanishing amid the storm.--
      Nae man can tether time or tide,
      The hour approaches, Tam maun ride;
      That hour o' night's black arch the key-stane,
      That dreary hour he mounts his beast in,
      And sic a night he taks the road in,
      As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.

        The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last;
      The rattling showers rose on the blast,
      The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd,
      Loud, deep, and lang, the thunder bellow'd:
      That night a child might understand,
      The Deil had business on his hand.

        Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,
      A better never lifted leg,
      Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire,
      Despising wind, and rain, and fire;
      Whiles haulding fast his gude blue bonnet;
      Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet;
      Whiles glowring round wi' prudent cares,
      Lest bogles catch him unawares;
      Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,
      Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.--

        By this time Tam was cross the ford,
      Whare in the snaw, the chapman smoor'd;
      And past the birks and meikle stane,
      Whare drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane;
      And thro' the whins, and by the cairn,
      Where hunters fand the murder'd bairn;
      And near the thorn, aboon the well,
      Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel.--
      Before him Doon pours all his floods;
      The doubling storm roars thro' the woods;
      The lightnings flash from pole to pole;
      Near and more near the thunders roll:
      Whan, glimmering thro' the groaning trees,
      Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze;
      Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing;
      And loud resounded mirth and dancing.

        Inspiring bold John Barleycorn!
      What dangers thou canst make us scorn!
      Wi' Tippenny, we fear nae evil,
      Wi' Usqueba, we'll face the devil!
      The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,
      Fair play, he car'd na de'ils a boddle.
      But Maggie stood right sair astonish'd,
      Till by the heel and hand admonish'd,
      She ventur'd forward on the light,
      And, vow! Tam saw an unco sight!
      Warlocks and witches in a dance,
      Nae light cotillion new frae France,
      But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,
      Put life and mettle in their heels.
      As winnock-bunker, in the east,
      There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast;
      A touzie tyke, black, grim, and large,
      To gie them music was his charge;
      He screw'd the pipes, and gart them skirl,
      Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.--
      Coffins stood round like open presses,
      That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses;
      And, by some devilish cantrip slight,
      Each in its cauld hand held a light--
      By which heroic Tam was able
      To note upon the haly table,
      A murderer's banes in gibbet-airns;
      Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns;
      A thief, new cutted frae a rape,
      Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape;
      Five tomahawks, wi' bluid red rusted;
      Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted;
      A garter, which a babe had strangled;
      A knife, a father's throat had mangled,
      Whom his ain son o' life bereft,
      The grey hairs yet stack to the heft;
      Wi' mair, o' horrible and awfu',
      Which e'en to name wad be unlawfu'.

        As Tammie glowr'd amaz'd, and curious,
      The mirth and fun grew fast and furious:
      The Piper loud and louder blew;
      The dancers quick and quicker flew;
      They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,
      Till ilka Carlin swat and reekit,
      And coost her duddies to the wark,
      And linket at it in her sark!

        Now Tam, O Tam! had they been queans
      A' plump and strapping in their teens;
      Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen,
      Been snaw-white seventeen hundred linen!
      Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,
      That ance were plush, o' guid blue hair,
      I wad hae gi'en them aff my hurdies,
      For ae blink o' the bonnie burdies!

        But wither'd beldams, auld and droll,
      Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,
      Louping and flinging on a crummock,
      I wonder did na turn thy stomach.

        But Tam ken'd what was what fu' brawly,
      There was ae winsome wench and waly,
      That night enlisted in the core,
      (Lang after ken'd on Carrick shore;
      For mony a beast to dead she shot,
      And perish'd mony a bonnie boat,
      And shook baith meikle corn and bear,
      And kept the country-side in fear--)
      Her cutty sark o' Paisley harn,
      That while a lassie she had worn,
      In longitude tho' sorely scanty,
      It was her best, and she was vaunty.--
      Ah! little ken'd thy reverend grannie,
      That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,
      Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches),
      Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches!

        But here my Muse her wing maun cour;
      Sic flights are far beyond her power:
      To sing how Nannie lap and flang,
      (A souple jade she was, and strang)
      And how Tam stood like ane bewitch'd,
      And thought his very een enrich'd;
      Ev'n Satan glowr'd and fidg'd fu' fain,
      And hotch't, and blew wi' might and main;
      Till first ae caper, syne anither,
      Tam tint his reason a' thegither,
      And roars out, "Weel done, Cutty Sark!"
      And in an instant all was dark;
      And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,
      When out the hellish legion sallied.

        As bees biz out wi' angry fyke
      When plundering herds assail their byke;
      As open pussie's mortal foes,
      When, pop! she starts before their nose;
      As eager rins the market-crowd,
      When "Catch the thief!" resounds aloud;
      So Maggie rins--the witches follow,
      Wi' mony an eldritch skreech and hollow,

        Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou 'll get thy fairin'!
      In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'!
      In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin'!
      Kate soon will be a waefu' woman!
      Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,
      And win the key-stane o' the brig;
      There, at them thou thy tail may toss,
      A running stream they dare na cross;
      But ere the key-stane she could make,
      The fient a tail she had to shake!
      For Nannie, far before the rest,
      Hard upon noble Maggie prest,
      And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;
      But little wist she Maggie's mettle--
      Ae spring brought off her master hale,
      But left behind, her ain grey tail:
      The Carlin claught her by the rump,
      And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.

        Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,
      Ilk man and mother's son tak heed:
      Whane'er to drink you are inclin'd,
      Or Cutty Sarks rin in your mind,
      Think, ye may buy the joys owre dear;
      Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare."

Burns has given the extremes of licentious eccentricity and convivial
enjoyment, in the story of this scape-grace, and of patriarchal
simplicity and gravity in describing the old national character of the
Scottish peasantry.  The Cotter's Saturday Night is a noble and pathetic
picture of human manners, mingled with a fine religious awe.  It comes
over the mind like a slow and solemn strain of music.  The soul of the
poet aspires from this scene of low-thoughted care, and reposes, in
trembling hope, on "the bosom of its Father and its God." Hardly any
thing can be more touching than the following stanzas, for instance,
whether as they describe human interests, or breathe a lofty devotional
spirit.

      "The toil-worn Cotter frae his labour goes,
        This night his weekly moil is at an end,
      Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes,
        Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,
      And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.

      At length his lonely cot appears in view,
        Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;
      Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through
        To meet their dad, wi' flichterin noise and glee.
      His wee-bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,
        His clean hearth-stane, his thriftie wifie's smile,
      The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,
        Does a' his weary carking cares beguile,
      And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil.

      Belyve, the elder bairns come drapping in,
        At service out, amang the farmers roun',
      Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin
        A cannie errand to a neebor town;
      Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,
        In youthfu' bloom, love sparkling in her e'e,
      Comes hame, perhaps, to shew a braw new gown,
        Or deposit her sair-won penny-fee,
      To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.

      Wi' joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet,
        An' each for other's welfare kindly spiers;
      The social hours, swift-winged, unnotic'd fleet;
        Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears:
      The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;
        Anticipation forward points the view;
      The mither, wi' her needle an' her shears,
        Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;
      The father mixes a' wi' admonition due.

      *   *   *   *   *   *   *

      But, hark! a rap comes gently to the door;
        Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,
      Tells how a neebor lad cam o'er the moor,
        To do some errands, and convoy her hame.
      The wily mother sees the conscious flame
        Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek;
      With heart-struck, anxious care, inquires his name,
        While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;
      Weel pleas'd the mother hears it's nae wild, worthless rake.

      Wi' kindly welcome, Jenny brings him ben;
        A strappan youth; he taks the mother's eye;
      Blithe Jenny sees the visit's no ill ta'en;
        The father craks of horses, pleughs, and kye.
      The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,
        But blate an' laithfu', scarce can weel behave;
      The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy
        What makes the youth sae bashfu' an' sae grave;
      Weel-pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave.

      But now the supper crowns their simple board,
        The halesome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food:
      The soupe their only hawkie does afford,
        That 'yont the hallan snugly chows her cood:
      The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,
        To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd kebbuck, fell,
      An' aft he's prest, an' aft he ca's it guid;
        The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell,
      How 'twas a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell.

      The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face,
        They, round the ingle, form a circle wide;
      The sire turns o'er, with patriarchal grace,
        The big ha'-Bible, ance his father's pride:
      His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
        His lyart haffets wearing thin an' bare;
      Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,
        He wales a portion wi' judicious care;
      And "Let us worship God!" he says, with solemn air.

      They chant their artless notes in simple guise;
        They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim:
      Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise,
        Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;
      Or noble Elgin beets the heav'n-ward flame,
        The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays:
      Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;
        The tickled ears no heart-felt raptures raise;
      Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise."--

Burns's poetical epistles to his friends are admirable, whether for
the touches of satire, the painting of character, or the sincerity of
friendship they display.  Those to Captain Grose, and to Davie, a brother
poet, are among the best:--they are "the true pathos and sublime of
human life." His prose-letters are sometimes tinctured with affectation.
They seem written by a man who has been admired for his wit, and is
expected on all occasions to shine.  Those in which he expresses his
ideas of natural beauty in reference to Alison's Essay on Taste, and
advocates the keeping up the remembrances of old customs and seasons,
are the most powerfully written.  His English serious odes and moral
stanzas are, in general, failures, such as The Lament, Man was made to
Mourn, &c. nor do I much admire his "Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled." In
this strain of didactic or sentimental moralising, the lines to
Glencairn are the most happy, and impressive.  His imitations of the old
humorous ballad style of Ferguson's songs are no whit inferior to the
admirable originals, such as "John Anderson, my Joe," and many more.  But
of all his productions, the pathetic and serious love-songs which he has
left behind him, in the manner of the old ballads, are perhaps those
which take the deepest and most lasting hold of the mind.  Such are the
lines to Mary Morison, and those entitled Jessy.

      "Here's a health to ane I lo'e dear--
      Here's a health to ane I lo'e dear--
      Thou art sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet,
        And soft as their parting tear--Jessy!

      Altho' thou maun never be mine,
        Altho' even hope is denied;
      'Tis sweeter for thee despairing,
        Than aught in the world beside--Jessy!"

The conclusion of the other is as follows.

      "Yestreen, when to the trembling string
        The dance gaed through the lighted ha',
      To thee my fancy took its wing,
        I sat, but neither heard nor saw.
      Tho' this was fair, and that was bra',
        And yon the toast of a' the town,
      I sighed and said among them a',
        Ye are na' Mary Morison."

That beginning, "Oh gin my love were a bonny red rose," is a piece of
rich and fantastic description.  One would think that nothing could
surpass these in beauty of expression, and in true pathos: and nothing
does or can, but some of the old Scotch ballads themselves.  There is in
them a still more original cast of thought, a more romantic imagery--
the thistle's glittering down, the gilliflower on the old garden-wall,
the horseman's silver bells, the hawk on its perch--a closer intimacy
with nature, a firmer reliance on it, as the only stock of wealth which
the mind has to resort to, a more infantine simplicity of manners, a
greater strength of affection, hopes longer cherished and longer
deferred, sighs that the heart dare hardly heave, and "thoughts that
often lie too deep for tears." We seem to feel that those who wrote and
sung them (the early minstrels) lived in the open air, wandering on from
place to place with restless feet and thoughts, and lending an ever-open
ear to the fearful accidents of war or love, floating on the breath of
old tradition or common fame, and moving the strings of their harp with
sounds that sank into a nation's heart.  How fine an illustration of this
is that passage in Don Quixote, where the knight and Sancho, going in
search of Dulcinea, inquire their way of the countryman, who was driving
his mules to plough before break of day, "singing the ancient ballad of
Roncesvalles." Sir Thomas Overbury describes his country girl as still
accompanied with fragments of old songs.  One of the best and most
striking descriptions of the effects of this mixture of national poetry
and music is to be found in one of the letters of Archbishop Herring,
giving an account of a confirmation-tour in the mountains of Wales.

      "That pleasure over, our work became very arduous, for we were to
mount a rock, and in many places of the road, over natural stairs of
stone.  I submitted to this, which they told me was but a taste of the
country, and to prepare me for worse things to come.  However, worse
things did not come that morning, for we dined soon after out of our own
wallets; and though our inn stood in a place of the most frightful
solitude, and the best formed for the habitation of monks (who once
possessed it) in the world, yet we made a cheerful meal.  The novelty of
the thing gave me spirits, and the air gave me appetite much keener than
the knife I ate with.  We had our music too; for there came in a harper,
who soon drew about us a group of figures that Hogarth would have given
any price for.  The harper was in his true place and attitude; a man and
woman stood before him, singing to his instrument wildly, but not
disagreeably; a little dirty child was playing with the bottom of the
harp; a woman in a sick night-cap hanging over the stairs; a boy with
crutches fixed in a staring attention, and a girl carding wool in the
chimney, and rocking a cradle with her naked feet, interrupted in her
business by the charms of the music; all ragged and dirty, and all
silently attentive.  These figures gave us a most entertaining picture,
and would please you or any man of observation; and one reflection gave
me a particular comfort, that the assembly before us demonstrated, that
even here, the influential sun warmed poor mortals, and inspired them
with love and music."

I could wish that Mr. Wilkie had been recommended to take this group
as the subject of his admirable pencil; he has painted a picture of
Bathsheba, instead.

In speaking of the old Scotch ballads, I need do no more than mention
the name of Auld Robin Gray.  The effect of reading this old ballad is as
if all our hopes and fears hung upon the last fibre of the heart, and we
felt that giving way.  What silence, what loneliness, what leisure for
grief and despair!

      "My father pressed me sair,
        Though my mother did na' speak;
      But she looked in my face
        Till my heart was like to break."

The irksomeness of the situations, the sense of painful dependence, is
excessive; and yet the sentiment of deep-rooted, patient affection
triumphs over all, and is the only impression that remains.  Lady Ann
Bothwell's Lament is not, I think, quite equal to the lines beginning--

      "O waly, waly, up the bank,
        And waly, waly, down the brae,
      And waly, waly, yon burn side,
        Where I and my love wont to gae.
      I leant my back unto an aik,
        I thought it was a trusty tree;
      But first it bow'd, and syne it brak,
        Sae my true-love's forsaken me.

      O waly, waly, love is bonny,
        A little time while it is new;
      But when its auld, it waxeth cauld,
        And fades awa' like the morning dew.
      When cockle-shells turn siller bells,
        And muscles grow on every tree,
      Whan frost and snaw sall warm us aw,
        Then sall my love prove true to me.

      Now Arthur seat sall be my bed,
        The sheets sall ne'er be fyld by me:
      Saint Anton's well sall be my drink,
        Since my true-love's forsaken me.
      Martinmas wind, when wilt thou blaw,
        And shake the green leaves aff the tree?
      O gentle death, whan wilt thou cum,
        And tak' a life that wearies me!

      'Tis not the frost that freezes sae,
        Nor blawing snaw's inclemencie,
      'Tis not sic cauld, that makes me cry,
        But my love's heart grown cauld to me.
      Whan we came in by Glasgow town,
        We were a comely sight to see,
      My love was clad in black velvet,
        And I myself in cramasie.

      But had I wist before I kist,
        That love had been sae hard to win;
      I'd lockt my heart in case of gowd,
        And pinn'd it with a siller pin.
      And oh! if my poor babe were born,
        And set upon the nurse's knee,
      And I mysel in the cold grave!
        Since my true-love 's forsaken me."

The finest modern imitation of this style is the Braes of Yarrow; and
perhaps the finest subject for a story of the same kind in any modern
book, is that told in Turner's History of England, of a Mahometan woman,
who having fallen in love with an English merchant, the father of Thomas
a Becket, followed him all the way to England, knowing only the word
London, and the name of her lover, Gilbert.

But to have done with this, which is rather too serious a subject.--
The old English ballads are of a gayer and more lively turn.
They are adventurous and romantic; but they relate chiefly to good
living and good fellowship, to drinking and hunting scenes.  Robin Hood
is the chief of these, and he still, in imagination, haunts Sherwood
Forest.  The archers green glimmer under the waving branches; the print
on the grass remains where they have just finished their noon-tide meal
under the green-wood tree; and the echo of their bugle-horn and twanging
bows resounds through the tangled mazes of the forest, as the tall slim
deer glances startled by.

      "The trees in Sherwood Forest are old and good;
        The grass beneath them now is dimly green:
        Are they deserted all?  Is no young mien,
      With loose-slung bugle, met within the wood?

      No arrow found--foil'd of its antler'd food--
        Struck in the oak's rude side?--Is there nought seen
        To mark the revelries which there have been,
      In the sweet days of merry Robin Hood?

      Go there with summer, and with evening--go
        In the soft shadows, like some wand'ring man--
        And thou shalt far amid the forest know
      The archer-men in green, with belt and bow,
        Feasting on pheasant, river-fowl, and swan,
        With Robin at their head, and Marian." [9]

LECTURE VIII.
ON THE LIVING POETS.


      "No more of talk where God or Angel guest
      With man, as with his friend, familiar us'd
      To sit indulgent."------

Genius is the heir of fame; but the hard condition on which the
bright reversion must be earned is the loss of life.  Fame is the
recompense not of the living, but of the dead.  The temple of fame stands
upon the grave: the flame that burns upon its altars is kindled from the
ashes of great men.  Fame itself is immortal, but it is not begot till
the breath of genius is extinguished.  For fame is not popularity, the
shout of the multitude, the idle buzz of fashion, the venal puff, the
soothing flattery of favour or of friendship; but it is the spirit of a
man surviving himself in the minds and thoughts of other men, undying
and imperishable.  It is the power which the intellect exercises over the
intellect, and the lasting homage which is paid to it, as such,
independently of time and circumstances, purified from partiality and
evil-speaking.  Fame is the sound which the stream of high thoughts,
carried down to future ages, makes as it flows--deep, distant,
murmuring evermore like the waters of the mighty ocean.  He who has ears
truly touched to this music, is in a manner deaf to the voice of
popularity.--The love of fame differs from mere vanity in this, that
the one is immediate and personal, the other ideal and abstracted.  It is
not the direct and gross homage paid to himself, that the lover of true
fame seeks or is proud of; but the indirect and pure homage paid to the
eternal forms of truth and beauty as they are reflected in his mind,
that gives him confidence and hope.  The love of nature is the first
thing in the mind of the true poet: the admiration of himself the last.
A man of genius cannot well be a coxcomb; for his mind is too full of
other things to be much occupied with his own person.  He who is
conscious of great powers in himself, has also a high standard of
excellence with which to compare his efforts: he appeals also to a test
and judge of merit, which is the highest, but which is too remote,
grave, and impartial, to flatter his self-love extravagantly, or puff
him up with intolerable and vain conceit.  This, indeed, is one test of
genius and of real greatness of mind, whether a man can wait patiently
and calmly for the award of posterity, satisfied with the unwearied
exercise of his faculties, retired within the sanctuary of his own
thoughts; or whether he is eager to forestal his own immortality, and
mortgage it for a newspaper puff.  He who thinks much of himself, will be
in danger of being forgotten by the rest of the world: he who is always
trying to lay violent hands on reputation, will not secure the best and
most lasting.  If the restless candidate for praise takes no pleasure, no
sincere and heartfelt delight in his works, but as they are admired and
applauded by others, what should others see in them to admire or
applaud? They cannot be expected to admire them because they are _his_;
but for the truth and nature contained in them, which must first be inly
felt and copied with severe delight, from the love of truth and nature,
before it can ever appear there.  Was Raphael, think you, when he painted
his pictures of the Virgin and Child in all their inconceivable truth
and beauty of expression, thinking most of his subject or of himself? Do
you suppose that Titian, when he painted a landscape, was pluming
himself on being thought the finest colourist in the world, or making
himself so by looking at nature? Do you imagine that Shakspeare, when he
wrote Lear or Othello, was thinking of any thing but Lear and Othello?
Or that Mr. Kean, when he plays these characters, is thinking of the
audience?--No: he who would be great in the eyes of others, must first
learn to be nothing in his own.  The love of fame, as it enters at times
into his mind, is only another name for the love of excellence; or it is
the ambition to attain the highest excellence, sanctioned by the highest
authority--that of time.

Those minds, then, which are the most entitled to expect it, can best
put up with the postponement of their claims to lasting fame.  They can
afford to wait.  They are not afraid that truth and nature will ever wear
out; will lose their gloss with novelty, or their effect with fashion.
If their works have the seeds of immortality in them, they will live; if
they have not, they care little about them as theirs.  They do not
complain of the start which others have got of them in the race of
everlasting renown, or of the impossibility of attaining the honours
which time alone can give, during the term of their natural lives.  They
know that no applause, however loud and violent, can anticipate or
over-rule the judgment of posterity; that the opinion of no one
individual, nor of any one generation, can have the weight, the
authority (to say nothing of the force of sympathy and prejudice), which
must belong to that of successive generations.  The brightest living
reputation cannot be equally imposing to the imagination, with that
which is covered and rendered venerable with the hoar of innumerable
ages.  No modern production can have the same atmosphere of sentiment
around it, as the remains of classical antiquity.  But then our moderns
may console themselves with the reflection, that they will be old in
their turn, and will either be remembered with still increasing honours,
or quite forgotten!

I would speak of the living poets as I have spoken of the dead (for I
think highly of many of them); but I cannot speak of them with the same
reverence, because I do not feel it; with the same confidence, because I
cannot have the same authority to sanction my opinion.  I cannot be
absolutely certain that any body, twenty years hence, will think any
thing about any of them; but we may be pretty sure that Milton and
Shakspeare will be remembered twenty years hence.  We are, therefore, not
without excuse if we husband our enthusiasm a little, and do not
prematurely lay out our whole stock in untried ventures, and what may
turn out to be false bottoms.  I have myself out-lived one generation of
favourite poets, the Darwins, the Hayleys, the Sewards.  Who reads them
now?--If, however, I have not the verdict of posterity to bear me out
in bestowing the most unqualified praises on their immediate successors,
it is also to be remembered, that neither does it warrant me in
condemning them.  Indeed, it was not my wish to go into this ungrateful
part of the subject; but something of the sort is expected from me, and
I must run the gauntlet as well as I can.  Another circumstance that adds
to the difficulty of doing justice to all parties is, that I happen to
have had a personal acquaintance with some of these jealous votaries of
the Muses; and that is not the likeliest way to imbibe a high opinion of
the rest.  Poets do not praise one another in the language of hyperbole.
I am afraid, therefore, that I labour under a degree of prejudice
against some of the most popular poets of the day, from an early habit
of deference to the critical opinions of some of the least popular.  I
cannot say that I ever learnt much about Shakspeare or Milton, Spenser
or Chaucer, from these professed guides; for I never heard them say much
about them.  They were always talking of themselves and one another.  Nor
am I certain that this sort of personal intercourse with living authors,
while it takes away all real relish or freedom of opinion with regard to
their contemporaries, greatly enhances our respect for themselves.  Poets
are not ideal beings; but have their prose-sides, like the commonest of
the people.  We often hear persons say, What they would have given to
have seen Shakspeare! For my part, I would give a great deal not to have
seen him; at least, if he was at all like any body else that I have ever
seen.  But why should he; for his works are not! This is, doubtless, one
great advantage which the dead have over the living.  It is always
fortunate for ourselves and others, when we are prevented from
exchanging admiration for knowledge.  The splendid vision that in youth
haunts our idea of the poetical character, fades, upon acquaintance,
into the light of common day; as the azure tints that deck the
mountain's brow are lost on a nearer approach to them.  It is well,
according to the moral of one of the Lyrical Ballads,--"To leave Yarrow
unvisited." But to leave this "face-making," and begin.--

I am a great admirer of the female writers of the present day; they
appear to me like so many modern Muses.  I could be in love with Mrs.
Inchbald, romantic with Mrs. Radcliffe, and sarcastic with Madame
D'Arblay: but they are novel-writers, and, like Audrey, may "thank the
Gods for not having made them poetical." Did any one here ever read Mrs.
Leicester's School? If they have not, I wish they would; there will be
just time before the next three volumes of the Tales of My Landlord come
out.  That is not a school of affectation, but of humanity.  No one can
think too highly of the work, or highly enough of the author.

The first poetess I can recollect is Mrs. Barbauld, with whose works
I became acquainted before those of any other author, male or female,
when I was learning to spell words of one syllable in her story-books
for children.  I became acquainted with her poetical works long after in
Enfield's Speaker; and remember being much divided in my opinion at that
time, between her Ode to Spring and Collins's Ode to Evening.  I wish I
could repay my childish debt of gratitude in terms of appropriate
praise.  She is a very pretty poetess; and, to my fancy, strews the
flowers of poetry most agreeably round the borders of religious
controversy.  She is a neat and pointed prose-writer.  Her "Thoughts on
the Inconsistency of Human Expectations," is one of the most ingenious
and sensible essays in the language.  There is the same idea in one of
Barrow's Sermons.

Mrs. Hannah More is another celebrated modern poetess, and I believe
still living.  She has written a great deal which I have never read.

Miss Baillie must make up this trio of female poets.  Her tragedies
and comedies, one of each to illustrate each of the passions, separately
from the rest, are heresies in the dramatic art.  She is a Unitarian in
poetry.  With her the passions are, like the French republic, one and
indivisible: they are not so in nature, or in Shakspeare.  Mr. Southey
has, I believe, somewhere expressed an opinion, that the Basil of Miss
Baillie is superior to Romeo and Juliet.  I shall not stay to contradict
him.  On the other hand, I prefer her De Montfort, which was condemned on
the stage, to some later tragedies, which have been more fortunate--to
the Remorse, Bertram, and lastly, Fazio.  There is in the chief character
of that play a nerve, a continued unity of interest, a setness of
purpose and precision of outline which John Kemble alone was capable of
giving; and there is all the grace which women have in writing.  In
saying that De Montfort was a character which just suited Mr. Kemble, I
mean to pay a compliment to both.  He was not "a man of no mark or
likelihood": and what he could be supposed to do particularly well, must
have a meaning in it.  As to the other tragedies just mentioned, there is
no reason why any common actor should not "make mouths in them at the
invisible event,"--one as well as another.  Having thus expressed my
sense of the merits of this authoress, I must add, that her comedy of
the Election, performed last summer at the Lyceum with indifferent
success, appears to me the perfection of baby-house theatricals.  Every
thing in it has such a _do-me-good_ air, is so insipid and amiable.
Virtue seems such a pretty playing at make-believe, and vice is such a
naughty word.  It is a theory of some French author, that little girls
ought not to be suffered to have dolls to play with, to call them
_pretty dears_, to admire their black eyes and cherry cheeks, to lament
and bewail over them if they fall down and hurt their faces, to praise
them when they are good, and scold them when they are naughty.  It is a
school of affectation: Miss Baillie has profited of it.  She treats her
grown men and women as little girls treat their dolls--makes moral
puppets of them, pulls the wires, and they talk virtue and act vice,
according to their cue and the title prefixed to each comedy or tragedy,
not from any real passions of their own, or love either of virtue or
vice.

The transition from these to Mr. Rogers's Pleasures of Memory, is not
far: he is a very lady-like poet.  He is an elegant, but feeble writer.
He wraps up obvious thoughts in a glittering cover of fine words; is
full of enigmas with no meaning to them; is studiously inverted, and
scrupulously far-fetched; and his verses are poetry, chiefly because no
particle, line, or syllable of them reads like prose.  He differs from
Milton in this respect, who is accused of having inserted a number of
prosaic lines in Paradise Lost.  This kind of poetry, which is a more
minute and inoffensive species of the Della Cruscan, is like the game of
asking what one's thoughts are like.  It is a tortuous, tottering,
wriggling, fidgetty translation of every thing from the vulgar tongue,
into all the tantalizing, teasing, tripping, lisping _mimminee-pimminee_
of the highest brilliancy and fashion of poetical diction.  You have
nothing like truth of nature or simplicity of expression.  The fastidious
and languid reader is never shocked by meeting, from the rarest chance
in the world, with a single homely phrase or intelligible idea.  You
cannot see the thought for the ambiguity of the language, the figure for
the finery, the picture for the varnish.  The whole is refined, and
frittered away into an appearance of the most evanescent brilliancy and
tremulous imbecility.--There is no other fault to be found with the
Pleasures of Memory, than a want of taste and genius.  The sentiments are
amiable, and the notes at the end highly interesting, particularly the
one relating to the Countess Pillar (as it is called) between Appleby
and Penrith, erected (as the inscription tells the thoughtful traveller)
by Anne Countess of Pembroke, in the year 1648, in memory of her last
parting with her good and pious mother in the same place in the year
1616--

      "To shew that power of love, how great
      Beyond all human estimate."

This story is also told in the poem, but with so many artful innuendos
and tinsel words, that it is hardly intelligible; and still less does it
reach the heart.

Campbell's Pleasures of Hope is of the same school, in which a
painful attention is paid to the expression in proportion as there is
little to express, and the decomposition of prose is substituted for the
composition of poetry.  How much the sense and keeping in the ideas are
sacrificed to a jingle of words and epigrammatic turn of expression, may
be seen in such lines as the following:--one of the characters, an old
invalid, wishes to end his days under

      "Some hamlet shade, to yield his sickly form
      Health in the breeze, and shelter in the storm."

Now the antithesis here totally fails: for it is the breeze, and not the
tree, or as it is quaintly expressed, _hamlet shade_, that affords
health, though it is the tree that affords shelter in or from the storm.
Instances of the same sort of _curiosa infelicitas_ are not rare in this
author.  His verses on the Battle of Hohenlinden have considerable spirit
and animation.  His Gertrude of Wyoming is his principal performance.  It
is a kind of historical paraphrase of Mr. Wordsworth's poem of Ruth.  It
shews little power, or power enervated by extreme fastidiousness.  It is

             "------Of outward show
      Elaborate; of inward less exact."

There are painters who trust more to the setting of their pictures than
to the truth of the likeness.  Mr. Campbell always seems to me to be
thinking how his poetry will look when it comes to be hot-pressed on
superfine wove paper, to have a disproportionate eye to points and
commas, and dread of errors of the press.  He is so afraid of doing
wrong, of making the smallest mistake, that he does little or nothing.
Lest he should wander irretrievably from the right path, he stands
still.  He writes according to established etiquette.  He offers the Muses
no violence.  If he lights upon a good thought, he immediately drops it
for fear of spoiling a good thing.  When he launches a sentiment that you
think will float him triumphantly for once to the bottom of the stanza,
he stops short at the end of the first or second line, and stands
shivering on the brink of beauty, afraid to trust himself to the
fathomless abyss.  _Tutus nimium, timidusque procellarum_.  His very
circumspection betrays him.  The poet, as well as the woman, that
deliberates, is undone.  He is much like a man whose heart fails him just
as he is going up in a balloon, and who breaks his neck by flinging
himself out of it when it is too late.  Mr. Campbell too often maims and
mangles his ideas before they are full formed, to fit them to the
Procustes' bed of criticism; or strangles his intellectual offspring in
the birth, lest they should come to an untimely end in the Edinburgh
Review.  He plays the hypercritic on himself, and starves his genius to
death from a needless apprehension of a plethora.  No writer who thinks
habitually of the critics, either to tremble at their censures or set
them at defiance, can write well.  It is the business of reviewers to
watch poets, not of poets to watch reviewers.--There is one admirable
simile in this poem, of the European child brought by the sooty Indian
in his hand, "like morning brought by night." The love-scenes in
Gertrude of Wyoming breathe a balmy voluptuousness of sentiment; but
they are generally broken off in the middle; they are like the scent of
a bank of violets, faint and rich, which the gale suddenly conveys in a
different direction.  Mr. Campbell is careful of his own reputation, and
economical of the pleasures of his readers.  He treats them as the fox in
the fable treated his guest the stork; or, to use his own expression,
his fine things are

      "Like angels' visits, few, and far between." [10]

There is another fault in this poem, which is the mechanical structure
of the fable.  The most striking events occur in the shape of antitheses.
The story is cut into the form of a parallelogram.  There is the same
systematic alternation of good and evil, of violence and repose, that
there is of light and shade in a picture.  The Indian, who is the chief
agent in the interest of the poem, vanishes and returns after long
intervals, like the periodical revolutions of the planets.  He
unexpectedly appears just in the nick of time, after years of absence,
and without any known reason but the convenience of the author and the
astonishment of the reader; as if nature were a machine constructed on a
principle of complete contrast, to produce a theatrical effect.  _Nec
Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus_.  Mr. Campbell's savage never
appears but upon great occasions, and then his punctuality is
preternatural and alarming.  He is the most wonderful instance on record
of poetical _reliability_.  The most dreadful mischiefs happen at the
most mortifying moments; and when your expectations are wound up to the
highest pitch, you are sure to have them knocked on the head by a
premeditated and remorseless stroke of the poet's pen.  This is done so
often for the convenience of the author, that in the end it ceases to be
for the satisfaction of the reader.

[10] There is the same idea in Blair's Grave.

                            "------Its visits,
      Like those of angels, short, and far between."

Mr. Campbell in altering the expression has  spoiled it.  "Few," and "far
between," are the same thing.

Tom Moore is a poet of a quite different stamp.  He is as heedless,
gay, and prodigal of his poetical wealth, as the other is careful,
reserved, and parsimonious.  The genius of both is national.  Mr. Moore's
Muse is another Ariel, as light, as tricksy, as indefatigable, and as
humane a spirit.  His fancy is for ever on the wing, flutters in the
gale, glitters in the sun.  Every thing lives, moves, and sparkles in his
poetry, while over all love waves his purple light.  His thoughts are as
restless, as many, and as bright as the insects that people the sun's
beam.  "So work the honey-bees," extracting liquid sweets from opening
buds; so the butterfly expands its wings to the idle air; so the
thistle's silver down is wafted over summer seas.  An airy voyager on
life's stream, his mind inhales the fragrance of a thousand shores, and
drinks of endless pleasures under halcyon skies.  Wherever his footsteps
tend over the enamelled ground of fairy fiction--

      "Around him the bees in play flutter and cluster,
      And gaudy butterflies frolic around."

The fault of Mr. Moore is an exuberance of involuntary power.  His
facility of production lessens the effect of, and hangs as a dead weight
upon, what he produces.  His levity at last oppresses.  The infinite
delight he takes in such an infinite number of things, creates
indifference in minds less susceptible of pleasure than his own.  He
exhausts attention by being inexhaustible.  His variety cloys; his
rapidity dazzles and distracts the sight.  The graceful ease with which
he lends himself to every subject, the genial spirit with which he
indulges in every sentiment, prevents him from giving their full force
to the masses of things, from connecting them into a whole.  He wants
intensity, strength, and grandeur.  His mind does not brood over the
great and permanent; it glances over the surfaces, the first impressions
of things, instead of grappling with the deep-rooted prejudices of the
mind, its inveterate habits, and that  "perilous stuff that weighs upon
the heart." His pen, as it is rapid and fanciful, wants momentum and
passion.  It requires the same principle to make us thoroughly like
poetry, that makes us like ourselves so well, the feeling of continued
identity.  The impressions of Mr. Moore's poetry are detached, desultory,
and physical.  Its gorgeous colours brighten and fade like the rainbow's.
Its sweetness evaporates like the effluvia exhaled from beds of flowers!
His gay laughing style, which relates to the immediate pleasures of love
or wine, is better than his sentimental and romantic vein.  His Irish
melodies are not free from affectation and a certain sickliness of
pretension.  His serious descriptions are apt to run into flowery
tenderness.  His pathos sometimes melts into a mawkish sensibility, or
crystallizes into all the prettinesses of allegorical language, and
glittering hardness of external imagery.  But he has wit at will, and of
the first quality.  His satirical and burlesque poetry is his best: it is
first-rate.  His Twopenny Post-Bag is a perfect "nest of spicery"; where
the Cayenne is not spared.  The politician there sharpens the poet's pen.
In this too, our bard resembles the bee--he has its honey and its
sting.

Mr. Moore ought not to have written Lalla Rookh, even for three
thousand guineas.  His fame is worth more than that.  He should have
minded the advice of Fadladeen.  It is not, however, a failure, so much
as an evasion and a consequent disappointment of public expectation.  He
should have left it to others to break conventions with nations, and
faith with the world.  He should, at any rate, have kept his with the
public.  Lalla Rookh is not what people wanted to see whether Mr. Moore
could do; namely, whether he could write a long epic poem.  It is four
short tales.  The interest, however, is often high-wrought and tragic,
but the execution still turns to the effeminate and voluptuous side.
Fortitude of mind is the first requisite of a tragic or epic writer.
Happiness of nature and felicity of genius are the pre-eminent
characteristics of the bard of Erin.  If he is not perfectly contented
with what he is, all the world beside is.  He had no temptation to risk
any thing in adding to the love and admiration of his age, and more than
one country.

      "Therefore to be possessed with double pomp,
      To guard a title that was rich before,
      To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
      To throw a perfume on the violet,
      To smooth the ice, or add another hue
      Unto the rainbow, or with taper light
      To seek the beauteous eye of heav'n to garnish,
      Is wasteful and ridiculous excess."

The same might be said of Mr. Moore's seeking to bind an epic crown, or
the shadow of one, round his other laurels.

If Mr. Moore has not suffered enough personally, Lord Byron (judging
from the tone of his writings) might be thought to have suffered too
much to be a truly great poet.  If Mr. Moore lays himself too open to all
the various impulses of things, the outward shews of earth and sky, to
every breath that blows, to every stray sentiment that crosses his
fancy; Lord Byron shuts himself up too much in the impenetrable gloom of
his own thoughts, and buries the natural light of things in "nook
monastic." The Giaour, the Corsair, Childe Harold, are all the same
person, and they are apparently all himself.  The everlasting repetition
of one subject, the same dark ground of fiction, with the darker colours
of the poet's mind spread over it, the unceasing accumulation of horrors
on horror's head, steels the mind against the sense of pain, as
inevitably as the unwearied Siren sounds and luxurious monotony of Mr.
Moore's poetry make it inaccessible to pleasure.  Lord Byron's poetry is
as morbid as Mr. Moore's is careless and dissipated.  He has more depth
of passion, more force and impetuosity, but the passion is always of the
same unaccountable character, at once violent and sullen, fierce and
gloomy.  It is not the passion of a mind struggling with misfortune, or
the hopelessness of its desires, but of a mind preying upon itself, and
disgusted with, or indifferent to all other things.  There is nothing
less poetical than this sort of unaccommodating selfishness.  There is
nothing more repulsive than this sort of ideal absorption of all the
interests of others, of the good and ills of life, in the ruling passion
and moody abstraction of a single mind, as if it would make itself the
centre of the universe, and there was nothing worth cherishing but its
intellectual diseases.  It is like a cancer, eating into the heart of
poetry.  But still there is power; and power rivets attention and forces
admiration.  "He hath a demon:" and that is the next thing to being full
of the God.  His brow collects the scattered gloom: his eye flashes livid
fire that withers and consumes.  But still we watch the progress of the
scathing bolt with interest, and mark the ruin it leaves behind with
awe.  Within the contracted range of his imagination, he has great unity
and truth of keeping.  He chooses elements and agents congenial to his
mind, the dark and glittering ocean, the frail bark hurrying before the
storm, pirates and men that "house on the wild sea with wild usages." He
gives the tumultuous eagerness of action, and the fixed despair of
thought.  In vigour of style and force of conception, he in one sense
surpasses every writer of the present day.  His indignant apothegms are
like oracles of misanthropy.  He who wishes for "a curse to kill with,"
may find it in Lord Byron's writings.  Yet he has beauty lurking
underneath his strength, tenderness sometimes joined with the phrenzy of
despair.  A flash of golden light sometimes follows from a stroke of his
pencil, like a falling meteor.  The flowers that adorn his poetry bloom
over charnel-houses and the grave!

There is one subject on which Lord Byron is fond of writing, on which
I wish he would not write--Buonaparte.  Not that I quarrel with his
writing for him, or against him, but with his writing both for him and
against him.  What right has he to do this? Buonaparte's character, be it
what else it may, does not change every hour according to his Lordship's
varying humour.  He is not a pipe for Fortune's finger, or for his
Lordship's Muse, to play what stop she pleases on.  Why should Lord Byron
now laud him to the skies in the hour of his success, and then peevishly
wreak his disappointment on the God of his idolatry? The man he writes
of does not rise or fall with circumstances: but "looks on tempests and
is never shaken." Besides, he is a subject for history, and not for
poetry.

      "Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
        But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
      And in themselves their pride lies buried;
        For at a frown they in their glory die.
      The painful warrior, famoused for fight,
        After a thousand victories once foil'd,
      Is from the book of honour razed quite,
        And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd."

If Lord Byron will write any thing more on this hazardous theme, let him
take these lines of Shakspeare for his guide, and finish them in the
spirit of the original--they will then be worthy of the subject.

Walter Scott is the most popular of all the poets of the present day,
and deservedly so.  He describes that which is most easily and generally
understood with more vivacity and effect than any body else.  He has no
excellences, either of a lofty or recondite kind, which lie beyond the
reach of the most ordinary capacity to find out; but he has all the good
qualities which all the world agree to understand.  His style is clear,
flowing, and transparent: his sentiments, of which his style is an easy
and natural medium, are common to him with his readers.  He has none of
Mr. Wordsworth's _idiosyncracy_.  He differs from his readers only in a
greater range of knowledge and facility of expression.  His poetry
belongs to the class of _improvisatori_ poetry.  It has neither depth,
height, nor breadth in it; neither uncommon strength, nor uncommon
refinement of thought, sentiment, or language.  It has no originality.
But if this author has no research, no moving power in his own breast,
he relies with the greater safety and success on the force of his
subject.  He selects a story such as is sure to please, full of
incidents, characters, peculiar manners, costume, and scenery; and he
tells it in a way that can offend no one.  He never wearies or
disappoints you.  He is communicative and garrulous; but he is not his
own hero.  He never obtrudes himself on your notice to prevent your
seeing the subject.  What passes in the poem, passes much as it would
have done in reality.  The author has little or nothing to do with it.
Mr. Scott has great intuitive power of fancy, great vividness of pencil
in placing external objects and events before the eye.  The force of his
mind is picturesque, rather than _moral_.  He gives more of the features
of nature than the soul of passion.  He conveys the distinct outlines and
visible changes in outward objects, rather than "their mortal
consequences." He is very inferior to Lord Byron in intense passion, to
Moore in delightful fancy, to Mr. Wordsworth in profound sentiment: but
he has more picturesque power than any of them; that is, he places the
objects themselves, about which _they_ might feel and think, in a much
more striking point of view, with greater variety of dress and attitude,
and with more local truth of colouring.  His imagery is Gothic and
grotesque.  The manners and actions have the interest and curiosity
belonging to a wild country and a distant period of time.  Few
descriptions have a more complete reality, a more striking appearance of
life and motion, than that of the warriors in the Lady of the Lake, who
start up at the command of Rhoderic Dhu, from their concealment under
the fern, and disappear again in an instant.  The Lay of the Last
Minstrel and Marmion are the first, and perhaps the best of his works.
The Goblin Page, in the first of these, is a very interesting and
inscrutable little personage.  In reading these poems, I confess I am a
little disconcerted, in turning over the page, to find Mr. Westall's
pictures, which always seem _fac-similes_ of the persons represented,
with ancient costume and a theatrical air.  This may be a compliment to
Mr. Westall, but it is not one to Walter Scott.  The truth is, there is a
modern air in the midst of the antiquarian research of Mr. Scott's
poetry.  It is history or tradition in masquerade.  Not only the crust of
old words and images is worn off with time,--the substance is grown
comparatively light and worthless.  The forms are old and uncouth; but
the spirit is effeminate and frivolous.  This is a deduction from the
praise I have given to his pencil for extreme fidelity, though it has
been no obstacle to its drawing-room success.  He has just hit the town
between the romantic and the fashionable; and between the two, secured
all classes of readers on his side.  In a word, I conceive that he is to
the great poet, what an excellent mimic is to a great actor.  There is no
determinate impression left on the mind by reading his poetry.  It has no
results.  The reader rises up from the perusal with new images and
associations, but he remains the same man that he was before.  A great
mind is one that moulds the minds of others.  Mr. Scott has put the
Border Minstrelsy and scattered traditions of the country into easy,
animated verse.  But the Notes to his poems are just as entertaining as
the poems themselves, and his poems are only entertaining.

Mr. Wordsworth is the most original poet now living.  He is the
reverse of Walter Scott in his defects and excellences.  He has nearly
all that the other wants, and wants all that the other possesses.  His
poetry is not external, but internal; it does not depend upon tradition,
or story, or old song; he furnishes it from his own mind, and is his own
subject.  He is the poet of mere sentiment.  Of many of the Lyrical
Ballads, it is not possible to speak in terms of too high praise, such
as Hart-leap Well, the Banks of the Wye, Poor Susan, parts of the
Leech-gatherer, the lines to a Cuckoo, to a Daisy, the Complaint,
several of the Sonnets, and a hundred others of inconceivable beauty, of
perfect originality and pathos.  They open a finer and deeper vein of
thought and feeling than any poet in modern times has done, or
attempted.  He has produced a deeper impression, and on a smaller circle,
than any other of his contemporaries.  His powers have been mistaken by
the age, nor does he exactly understand them himself.  He cannot form a
whole.  He has not the constructive faculty.  He can give only the fine
tones of thought, drawn from his mind by accident or nature, like the
sounds drawn from the AEolian harp by the wandering gale.--He is
totally deficient in all the machinery of poetry.  His _Excursion_, taken
as a whole, notwithstanding the noble materials thrown away in it, is a
proof of this.  The line labours, the sentiment moves slow, but the poem
stands stock-still.  The reader makes no way from the first line to the
last.  It is more than any thing in the world like Robinson Crusoe's
boat, which would have been an excellent good boat, and would have
carried him to the other side of the globe, but that he could not get it
out of the sand where it stuck fast.  I did what little I could to help
to launch it at the time, but it would not do.  I am not, however, one of
those who laugh at the attempts or failures of men of genius.  It is not
my way to cry "Long life to the conqueror." Success and desert are not
with me synonymous terms; and the less Mr. Wordsworth's general merits
have been understood, the more necessary is it to insist upon them.  This
is not the place to repeat what I have already said on the subject.  The
reader may turn to it in the Round Table.  I do not think, however, there
is any thing in the larger poem equal to many of the detached pieces in
the Lyrical Ballads.  As Mr. Wordsworth's poems have been little known to
the public, or chiefly through garbled extracts from them, I will here
give an entire poem (one that has always been a favourite with me), that
the reader may know what it is that the admirers of this author find to
be delighted with in his poetry.  Those who do not feel the beauty and
the force of it, may save themselves the trouble of inquiring farther.

HART-LEAP WELL.

      The knight had ridden down from Wensley moor
        With the slow motion of a summer's cloud;
      He turned aside towards a vassal's door,
        And, "Bring another horse!" he cried aloud.

      "Another horse!"--That shout the vassal heard,
        And saddled his best steed, a comely gray;
      Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third
        Which he had mounted on that glorious day.

      Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes:
        The horse and horseman are a happy pair;
      But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,
        There is a doleful silence in the air.

      A rout this morning left Sir Walter's hall,
        That as they galloped made the echoes roar;
      But horse and man are vanished, one and all;
        Such race, I think, was never seen before.

      Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,
        Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain:
      Brach, Swift, and Music, noblest of their kind,
        Follow, and up the weary mountain strain.

      The knight hallooed, he chid and cheered them on
        With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern;
      But breath and eye-sight fail; and, one by one,
        The dogs are stretched among the mountain fern.

      Where is the throng, the tumult of the race?
        The bugles that so joyfully were blown?
        --This chase it looks not like an earthly chase;
        Sir Walter and the hart are left alone.

      The poor hart toils along the mountain side;
        I will not stop to tell how far he fled,
      Nor will I mention by what death he died;
        But now the knight beholds him lying dead.

      Dismounting then, he leaned against a thorn;
        He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy:
      He neither smacked his whip, nor blew his horn,
        But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy.

      Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned,
        Stood his dumb partner in this glorious act;
      Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned;
        And foaming like a mountain cataract.

      Upon his side the hart was lying stretched:
        His nose half-touched a spring beneath a hill,
      And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched
        The waters of the spring were trembling still.

      And now, too happy for repose or rest,
        (Was never man in such a joyful case!)
      Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west,
        And gazed, and gazed upon that darling place.

      And climbing up the hill--(it was at least
        Nine roods of sheer ascent) Sir Walter found,
      Three several hoof-marks which the hunted beast
        Had left imprinted on the verdant ground.

      Sir Walter wiped his face and cried, "Till now
        Such sight was never seen by living eyes:
      Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,
        Down to the very fountain where he lies.

      I'll build a pleasure-house upon this spot,
        And a small arbour, made for rural joy;
      'Twill be the traveller's shed, the pilgrim's cot,
        A place of love for damsels that are coy.

      A cunning artist will I have to frame
        A bason for that fountain in the dell;
      And they, who do make mention of the same
        From this day forth, shall call it HART-LEAP WELL.

      And, gallant brute! to make thy praises known,
        Another monument shall here be raised;
      Three several pillars, each a rough-hewn stone,
        And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed.

      And, in the summer-time when days are long,
        I will come hither with my paramour;
      And with the dancers, and the minstrel's song,
        We will make merry in that pleasant bower.

      Till the foundations of the mountains fail,
        My mansion with its arbour shall endure;--
      The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,
        And them who dwell among the woods of Ure!"

      Then home he went, and left the hart, stone-dead,
        With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring.
      --Soon did the knight perform what he had said,
        And far and wide the fame thereof did ring.

      Ere thrice the moon into her port had steered,
        A cup of stone received the living well;
      Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter reared,
        And built a house of pleasure in the dell.

      And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall
        With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,--
      Which soon composed a little sylvan hall,
        A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.

      And thither, when the summer-days were long,
        Sir Walter journeyed with his paramour;
      And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
        Made merriment within that pleasant bower.

      The knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time,
        And his bones lie in his paternal vale.--
      But there is matter for a second rhyme,
        And I to this would add another tale."

PART SECOND.

      "The moving accident is not my trade:
        To freeze the blood I have no ready arts:
      'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,
        To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts.

      As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair,
        It chanced that I saw standing in a dell
      Three aspens at three corners of a square,
        And one, not four yards distant, near a well.

      What this imported I could ill divine:
        And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop,
      I saw three pillars standing in a line,
        The last stone pillar on a dark hill-top.

      The trees were gray, with neither arms nor head;
        Half-wasted the square mound of tawny green;
      So that you just might say, as then I said,
        "Here in old time the hand of man hath been."

      I looked upon the hill both far and near,
        More doleful place did never eye survey;
      It seemed as if the spring-time came not here,
        And Nature here were willing to decay.

      I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost,
        When one, who was in shepherd's garb attired,
      Came up the hollow:--Him did I accost,
        And what this place might be I then inquired.

      The shepherd stopped, and that same story told
        Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed.
      "A jolly place," said he, "in times of old!
        But something ails it now; the spot is curst.

      You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood--
        Some say that they are beeches, others elms--
      These were the bower; and here a mansion stood,
        The finest palace of a hundred realms!

      The arbour does its own condition tell;
        You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream;
      But as to the great lodge! you might as well
        Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.

      There's neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep,
        Will wet his lips within that cup of stone;
      And oftentimes, when all are fast asleep,
        This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.

      Some say that here a murder has been done,
        And blood cries out for blood: but, for my part,
      I've guessed, when I've been sitting in the sun,
        That it was all for that unhappy hart.

      What thoughts must through the creature's brain have passed!
        Even from the top-most stone, upon the steep,
      Are but three bounds--and look, Sir, at this last--
        --O Master! it has been a cruel leap.

      For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race;
        And in my simple mind we cannot tell
      What cause the hart might have to love this place,
        And come and make his death-bed near the well.

      Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank,
        Lulled by this fountain in the summer-tide;
      This water was perhaps the first he drank
        When he had wandered from his mother's side.

      In April here beneath the scented thorn
        He heard the birds their morning carols sing;
      And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born
        Not half a furlong from that self-same spring.

      But now here's neither grass nor pleasant shade;
        The sun on drearier hollow never shone;
      So will it be, as I have often said,
        Till trees, and stones, and fountain all are gone."

      "Gray-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well;
        Small difference lies between thy creed and mine:
      This beast not unobserved by Nature fell;
        His death was mourned by sympathy divine.

      The Being, that is in the clouds and air,
        That is in the green leaves among the groves,
      Maintains a deep, and reverential care
        For the unoffending creatures whom he loves.

      The pleasure-house is dust:--behind, before,
        This is no common waste, no common gloom;
      But Nature, in due course of time, once more
        Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.

      She leaves these objects to a slow decay,
        That what we are, and have been, may be known;
      But at the coming of the milder day,
        These monuments shall all be overgrown.

      One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide,
        Taught both by what she shews, and what conceals,
      Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
        With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels."

Mr. Wordsworth is at the head of that which has been denominated the
Lake school of poetry; a school which, with all my respect for it, I do
not think sacred from criticism or exempt from faults, of some of which
faults I shall speak with becoming frankness; for I do not see that the
liberty of the press ought to be shackled, or freedom of speech
curtailed, to screen either its revolutionary or renegado extravagances.
This school of poetry had its origin in the French revolution, or rather
in those sentiments and opinions which produced that revolution; and
which sentiments and opinions were indirectly imported into this country
in translations from the German about that period.  Our poetical
literature had, towards the close of the last century, degenerated into
the most trite, insipid, and mechanical of all things, in the hands of
the followers of Pope and the old French school of poetry.  It wanted
something to stir it up, and it found that some thing in the principles
and events of the French revolution.  From the impulse it thus received,
it rose at once from the most servile imitation and tamest common-place,
to the utmost pitch of singularity and paradox.  The change in the
belles-lettres was as complete, and to many persons as startling, as the
change in politics, with which it went hand in hand.  There was a mighty
ferment in the heads of statesmen and poets, kings and people.  According
to the prevailing notions, all was to be natural and new.  Nothing that
was established was to be tolerated.  All the common-place figures of
poetry, tropes, allegories, personifications, with the whole heathen
mythology, were instantly discarded; a classical allusion was considered
as a piece of antiquated foppery; capital letters were no more allowed
in print, than letters-patent of nobility were permitted in real life;
kings and queens were dethroned from their rank and station in
legitimate tragedy or epic poetry, as they were decapitated elsewhere;
rhyme was looked upon as a relic of the feudal system, and regular metre
was abolished along with regular government.  Authority and fashion,
elegance or arrangement, were hooted out of countenance, as pedantry and
prejudice.  Every one did that which was good in his own eyes.  The object
was to reduce all things to an absolute level; and a singularly affected
and outrageous simplicity prevailed in dress and manners, in style and
sentiment.  A striking effect produced where it was least expected,
something new and original, no matter whether good, bad, or indifferent,
whether mean or lofty, extravagant or childish, was all that was aimed
at, or considered as compatible with sound philosophy and an age of
reason.  The licentiousness grew extreme: Coryate's Crudities were
nothing to it.  The world was to be turned topsy-turvy; and poetry, by
the good will of our Adam-wits, was to share its fate and begin _de
novo_.  It was a time of promise, a renewal of the world and of letters;
and the Deucalions, who were to perform this feat of regeneration, were
the present poet-laureat and the two authors of the Lyrical Ballads.  The
Germans, who made heroes of robbers, and honest women of cast-off
mistresses, had already exhausted the extravagant and marvellous in
sentiment and situation: our native writers adopted a wonderful
simplicity of style and matter.  The paradox they set out with was, that
all things are by nature equally fit subjects for poetry; or that if
there is any preference to be given, those that are the meanest and most
unpromising are the best, as they leave the greatest scope for the
unbounded stores of thought and fancy in the writer's own mind.  Poetry
had with them "neither buttress nor coigne of vantage to make its
pendant bed and procreant cradle." It was not "born so high: its aiery
buildeth in the cedar's top, and dallies with the wind, and scorns the
sun." It grew like a mushroom out of the ground; or was hidden in it
like a truffle, which it required a particular sagacity and industry to
find out and dig up.  They founded the new school on a principle of sheer
humanity, on pure nature void of art.  It could not be said of these
sweeping reformers and dictators in the republic of letters, that "in
their train walked crowns and crownets; that realms and islands, like
plates, dropt from their pockets": but they were surrounded, in company
with the Muses, by a mixed rabble of idle apprentices and Botany Bay
convicts, female vagrants, gipsies, meek daughters in the family of
Christ, of ideot boys and mad mothers, and after them "owls and
night-ravens flew." They scorned "degrees, priority, and place,
insisture, course, proportion, season, form, office, and custom in all
line of order":--the distinctions of birth, the vicissitudes of
fortune, did not enter into their abstracted, lofty, and levelling
calculation of human nature.  He who was more than man, with them was
none.  They claimed kindred only with the commonest of the people:
peasants, pedlars, and village-barbers were their oracles and bosom
friends.  Their poetry, in the extreme to which it professedly tended,
and was in effect carried, levels all distinctions of nature and
society; has "no figures nor no fantasies," which the prejudices of
superstition or the customs of the world draw in the brains of men; "no
trivial fond records" of all that has existed in the history of past
ages; it has no adventitious pride, pomp, or circumstance, to set it
off; "the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe;" neither tradition,
reverence, nor ceremony, "that to great ones 'longs": it breaks in
pieces the golden images of poetry, and defaces its armorial bearings,
to melt them down in the mould of common humanity or of its own upstart
self-sufficiency.  They took the same method in their new-fangled "metre
ballad-mongering" scheme, which Rousseau did in his prose paradoxes--
of exciting attention by reversing the established standards of opinion
and estimation in the world.  They were for bringing poetry back to its
primitive simplicity and state of nature, as he was for bringing society
back to the savage state: so that the only thing remarkable left in the
world by this change, would be the persons who had produced it.  A
thorough adept in this school of poetry and philanthropy is jealous of
all excellence but his own.  He does not even like to share his
reputation with his subject; for he would have it all proceed from his
own power and originality of mind.  Such a one is slow to admire any
thing that is admirable; feels no interest in what is most interesting
to others, no grandeur in any thing grand, no beauty in anything
beautiful.  He tolerates only what he himself creates; he sympathizes
only with what can enter into no competition with him, with "the bare
trees and mountains bare, and grass in the green field." He sees nothing
but himself and the universe.  He hates all greatness and all pretensions
to it, whether well or ill-founded.  His egotism is in some respects a
madness; for he scorns even the admiration of himself, thinking it a
presumption in any one to suppose that he has taste or sense enough to
understand him.  He hates all science and all art; he hates chemistry, he
hates conchology; he hates Voltaire; he hates Sir Isaac Newton; he hates
wisdom; he hates wit; he hates metaphysics, which he says are
unintelligible, and yet he would be thought to understand them; he hates
prose; he hates all poetry but his own; he hates the dialogues in
Shakespeare; he hates music, dancing, and painting; he hates Rubens, he
hates Rembrandt; he hates Raphael, he hates Titian; he hates Vandyke; he
hates the antique; he hates the Apollo Belvidere; he hates the Venus of
Medicis.  This is the reason that so few people take an interest in his
writings, because he takes an interest in nothing that others do!--The
effect has been perceived as something odd; but the cause or principle
has never been distinctly traced to its source before, as far as I know.
The proofs are to be found every where--in Mr. Southey's Botany Bay
Eclogues, in his book of Songs and Sonnets, his Odes and Inscriptions,
so well parodied in the Anti-Jacobin Review, in his Joan of Arc, and
last, though not least, in his Wat Tyler:

      "When Adam delved, and Eve span,
      Where was then the gentleman?"

(--or the poet laureat either, we may ask?)--In Mr. Coleridge's Ode to
an Ass's Foal, in his Lines to Sarah, his Religious Musings; and in his
and Mr. Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads, _passim_.

Of Mr. Southey's larger epics, I have but a faint recollection at
this distance of time, but all that I remember of them is mechanical and
extravagant, heavy and superficial.  His affected, disjointed style is
well imitated in the Rejected Addresses.  The difference between him and
Sir Richard Blackmore seems to be, that the one is heavy and the other
light, the one solemn and the other pragmatical, the one phlegmatic and
the other flippant; and that there is no Gay in the present time to give
a Catalogue Raisonne of the performances of the living undertaker of
epics.  Kehama is a loose sprawling figure, such as we see cut out of
wood or paper, and pulled or jerked with wire or thread, to make sudden
and surprising motions, without meaning, grace, or nature in them.  By
far the best of his works are some of his shorter personal compositions,
in which there is an ironical mixture of the quaint and serious, such as
his lines on a picture of Gaspar Poussin, the fine tale of Gualberto,
his Description of a Pig, and the Holly-tree, which is an affecting,
beautiful, and modest retrospect on his own character.  May the
aspiration with which it concludes be fulfilled! [11]--But the little
he has done of true and sterling excellence, is overloaded by the
quantity of indifferent matter which he turns out every year, "prosing
or versing," with equally mechanical and irresistible facility.  His
Essays, or political and moral disquisitions, are not so full of
original matter as Montaigne's.  They are second or third rate
compositions in that class.

      "O reader! hast thou ever stood to see
            The Holly Tree?
      The eye that contemplates it well perceives
            Its glossy leaves,
      Ordered by an intelligence so wise
      As might confound the Atheist's sophistries.

      Below, a circling fence, its leaves are seen
            Wrinkled and keen;
      No grazing cattle through their prickly round
            Can reach to wound;
      But as they grow where nothing is to fear,
      Smooth and unarm'd the pointless leaves appear.

      I love to view these things with curious eyes,
            And moralize;
      And in the wisdom of the Holly Tree
            Can emblems see
      Wherewith perchance to make a pleasant rhyme,
      Such as may profit in the after time.

      So, though abroad perchance I might appear
            Harsh and austere,
      To those who on my leisure would intrude
            Reserved and rude,
      Gentle at home amid my friends I'd be,
      Like the high leaves upon the Holly Tree.

      And should my youth, as youth is apt I know,
            Some harshness show,
      All vain asperities I day by day
            Would wear away,
      Till the smooth temper of my age should be
      Like the high leaves upon the Holly Tree.

      And as when all the summer trees are seen
            So bright and green,
      The Holly leaves their fadeless hues display
            Less bright than they,
      But when the bare and wintry woods we see,
      What then so cheerful as the Holly Tree?

      So serious should my youth appear among
            The thoughtless throng,
      So would I seem amid the young and gay
            More grave than they,
      That in my age as cheerful I might be
      As the green winter of the Holly Tree."--

It remains that I should say a few words of Mr. Coleridge; and there
is no one who has a better right to say what he thinks of him than I
have.  "Is there here any dear friend of Caesar? To him I say, that
Brutus's love to Caesar was no less than his." But no matter.--His
Ancient Mariner is his most remarkable performance, and the only one
that I could point out to any one as giving an adequate idea of his
great natural powers.  It is high German, however, and in it he seems to
"conceive of poetry but as a drunken dream, reckless, careless, and
heedless, of past, present, and to come." His tragedies (for he has
written two) are not answerable to it; they are, except a few poetical
passages, drawling sentiment and metaphysical jargon.  He has no genuine
dramatic talent.  There is one fine passage in his Christobel, that which
contains the description of the quarrel between Sir Leoline and Sir
Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine, who had been friends in youth.

        "Alas! they had been friends in youth,
      But whispering tongues can poison truth;
      And constancy lives in realms above;
      And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
      And to be wroth with one we love,
      Doth work like madness in the brain:
      And thus it chanc'd as I divine,
      With Roland and Sir Leoline.
      Each spake words of high disdain
      And insult to his heart's best brother,
      And parted ne'er to meet again!
      But neither ever found another
      To free the hollow heart from paining--

        They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
      Like cliffs which had been rent asunder:
      A dreary sea now flows between,
      But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
      Shall wholly do away I ween
      The marks of that which once hath been.

        Sir Leoline a moment's space
      Stood gazing on the damsel's face;
      And the youthful lord of Tryermaine
      Came back upon his heart again."

It might seem insidious if I were to praise his ode entitled Fire,
Famine, and Slaughter, as an effusion of high poetical enthusiasm, and
strong political feeling.  His Sonnet to Schiller conveys a fine
compliment to the author of the Robbers, and an equally fine idea of the
state of youthful enthusiasm in which he composed it.

      "Schiller! that hour I would have wish'd to die,
        If through the shudd'ring midnight I had sent
        From the dark dungeon of the tower time-rent,
      That fearful voice, a famish'd father's cry--

      That in no after moment aught less vast
        Might stamp me mortal!  A triumphant shout
        Black Horror scream'd, and all her goblin rout
      From the more with'ring scene diminish'd pass'd.

      Ah! Bard tremendous in sublimity!
        Could I behold thee in thy loftier mood,
      Wand'ring at eve, with finely frenzied eye,
        Beneath some vast old tempest-swinging wood!
        Awhile, with mute awe gazing, I would brood,
      Then weep aloud in a wild ecstacy!"--

His _Conciones ad Populum_, Watchman, &c. are dreary trash.  Of his
Friend, I have spoken the truth elsewhere.  But I may say of him here,
that he is the only person I ever knew who answered to the idea of a man
of genius.  He is the only person from whom I ever learnt any thing.
There is only one thing he could learn from me in return, but _that_ he
has not.  He was the first poet I ever knew.  His genius at that time had
angelic wings, and fed on manna.  He talked on for ever; and you wished
him to talk on for ever.  His thoughts did not seem to come with labour
and effort; but as if borne on the gusts of genius, and as if the wings
of his imagination lifted him from off his feet.  His voice rolled on the
ear like the pealing organ, and its sound alone was the music of
thought.  His mind was clothed with wings; and raised on them, he lifted
philosophy to heaven.  In his descriptions, you then saw the progress of
human happiness and liberty in bright and never-ending succession, like
the steps of Jacob's ladder, with airy shapes ascending and descending,
and with the voice of God at the top of the ladder.  And shall I, who
heard him then, listen to him now?  Not I! . . . That spell is broke; that
time is gone for ever; that voice is heard no more: but still the
recollection comes rushing by with thoughts of long-past years, and
rings in my ears with never-dying sound.

        "What though the radiance which was once so bright,
      Be now for ever taken from my sight,
      Though nothing can bring back the hour
      Of glory in the grass, of splendour in the flow'r;
        I do not grieve, but rather find
        Strength in what remains behind;
        In the primal sympathy,
        Which having been, must ever be;
        In the soothing thoughts that spring
        Out of human suffering;
      In years that bring the philosophic mind!"--

I have thus gone through the task I intended, and have come at last
to the level ground.  I have felt my subject gradually sinking from under
me as I advanced, and have been afraid of ending in nothing.  The
interest has unavoidably decreased at almost every successive step of
the progress, like a play that has its catastrophe in the first or
second act.  This, however, I could not help.  I have done as well as I
could.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
