  NOTES.

  THE BREECHES, OR GENEVA BIBLE.


  Of this, the most popular edition of the Scriptures
  in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, we meet
  continually with erroneous opinions of its rarity,
  and also of its value, which the following brief
  statement may tend in a degree to correct.

  The translation was undertaken by certain reformers
  who fled to Geneva during the reign of
  Queen Mary; and is attributed to W. Whittingham,
  Anthony Gilby, Miles Coverdale, Thomas
  Sampson, Christopher Goodman, Thomas Cole,
  John Knox, John Bodleigh, and John Pullain;
  but Mr. Anderson, in his _History of the English
  Bible_, says that the translators were Whittingham,
  Gilby, and Sampson: and from the facts stated, he
  is, no doubt, correct.

  It is called the "Breeches Bible" from the
  rendering of Genesis, iii. 7.:

  "Then the eyes of them bothe were opened, and they
  knewe that they were naked, and they sewed fig tree
  leaves together, and made themselves breeches."

  The first edition of the Geneva Bible was printed
  at Geneva in 1562, folio, preceded by a dedication
  to Queen Elizabeth, and an address "To our beloved
  in the lord the brethren of England, Scotland,
  Ireland," &c.; dated from Geneva, 10th
  April, 1561. This edition contains two remarkable
  errors: Matt. v. 9. "Blessed are the _place_
  makers." Luke xxi. "Chris _condemneth_ the poor
  widow." This is the first Bible divided into verses.

  Second edit. 4to., printed at Geneva, 1569. To
  this edition is added "Certeine Tables, A Calendar,
  and Fairs in Fraunce and elsewhere."

  The first edition printed in London is a small
  folio. Imprinted by Christopher Barker, 1576.

  The first edition of the Scriptures printed in
  Scotland is the Geneva version, folio, began 1576,
  by Thomas Bassandyne; and finished in 1579 by
  Alexander Arbuthnot.

  Other editions, 1577, London, sm. fol.; 1578,
  sm. fol.; 4to., 1579; two editions 4to., 1580, 1581;
  sm. fol.; 1582; 4to., 1583; lar. fol., 1583; 4to.,
  1585; 4to., 1586; 8vo., 1586; 4to., 1587; 4to.,
  1588; 4to., 1589; 8vo., Cambridge, 1591, supposed
  to be first printed at the university; fol.,
  1592; 4to., 1594; 4to., 1595; fol., 1595; 4to.,
  1597; sm. fol., 1597; 4to., 1598; 4to., 1599. Of this
  last date, said to be "Imprinted at London by the
  deputies of Chr. Barker," but probably printed at
  Dort, and other places in Holland, there were at
  least seven editions; and, before 1611, there were
  at least twenty other editions.

  Between the years 1562 and 1611, there were
  printed at least 130 editions of the Geneva Bible,
  in folio, 4to., and 8vo.; each edition probably consisted
  of 1000 copies.

  Persons who know but little of the numbers
  which are extant of this volume, have asked 100l.,
  {18}
  30l., and other like sums, for a copy; whereas, as
  many shillings is about the value of the later
  editions.

  The notes by the Reformers from the margin
  of the Geneva version, have been reprinted with
  what is usually called King James' version, the one
  now in use, in the editions printed at Amsterdam,
  at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

  POEMS DISCOVERED AMONG THE PAPERS OF SIR KENELM DIGBY.

  MR. HALLIWELL (Vol. ii., p. 238.) says that he
  does not believe my MS. of the "Minde of the
  Lady Venetia Digby" can be an autograph. I
  have reason to think that he is right from discovering
  another MS. written in the same hand as the
  above, and containing two poems without date or
  signature, neither of which (I _believe_) are Ben
  Jonson's. I enclose the shorter of the two, and
  should feel obliged if any of your correspondents
  could tell me the author of it, as this would throw
  some light upon the _writer_ of the two MSS.

          THE HOURGLASSE.

  Doe but consider this small dust running in this glasse,
      By atoms moved;
  Would you believe that this the body ever was
      Of one that loved;
  Who in his mistresse flames playing like a fly,
      Burnt to cinders by her eye?
  Yes! and in death as life unblest,
      To have it exprest
  Even ashes of lovers have no rest.

I also enclose a copy of another poem I have discovered, which appears to
me very curious, and, from the date, written the very year of the visit of
Prince Charles and Buckingham to the court of Spain. Has it ever been
printed, and who is the author?

  What sodaine change hath dark't of late
    The glory of the Arcadian state?
  The fleecy flocks refuse to feede
  The Lambes to play, the Ewes to breede
    The altars make(s) the offeringes burne
    That Jack and Tom may safe returne.

  The Springe neglectes his course to keepe,
    The Ayre continual stormes do weepe,
  The pretty Birdes disdaine to singe,
  The Maides to smile, the woods to springe,
    The Mountaines droppe, the valleys morne
    Till Jack and Tom do safe returne.

  What may that be that mov'd this woe?
    Whose want afflicts Arcadia so?
  The hope of Greece, the proppe of artes,
  Was prinly Jack, the joy of hartes.
    And Tom was to his Royall Paw
    His trusty swayne, his chiefest maw.

  The loftye Toppes of Menalus
    Did shake with winde from Hesperus,
  Whose sweete delicious Ayre did fly
  Through all the Boundes of Arcady,
    Which mov'd a vaine in Jack and Tom
    To see the coast the winde came from.

  This winde was love, which Princes state
    To Pages turn, but who can hate
  Where equall fortune love procures,
  Or equall love success assures?
    So virtuous Jack shall bring from Greece
    The Beautyous prize, the Golden fleece.

  Love is a world of many paines,
    Where coldest hills, and hottest playnes,
  With barren rockes and fertill fieldes
  By turne despaire and comforte yeldes;
    But who can doubt of prosperous lucke
    Where Love and fortune both conducte?

  Thy Grandsire great, and father too,
    Were thine examples thus to doe,
  Whose brave attempts, in heate of love,
  Both France and Denmark did approve.
    For Jack and Tom do nothing newe
    When Love and Fortune they pursue.

  Kind shepheardes that have lov'd them long,
    Be not rasfe in censuringe wronge,
  Correct your feares, leave of to mourne,
  The Heavens will favour their returne;
    Committ your cares to Royall Pan,
    For Jack his sonne and Tom his man.

                  FINIS.

From London, 31. Martii, 1623.

Prefaced to this poem is an extract from a letter of Buckingham's to his
wife, containing an account of their reception: but it is hardly worth
copying.

WORKS OF CAMOENS.

Having been requested by a foreign nobleman to furnish him with a list of
the editions of the works of Camoens, and of the various translations, I
have prepared one; and considering the information might be interesting to
several of your readers, I send you a copy for insertion It besides affords
an opportunity of asking after those editions, to which I have added the
observations. The first star indicates that the works are in my private
collection, as are several other works relating to that celebrated poet.
Obras means the collected works.

FOLK LORE.

_May Cats._--In Wilts, and also in Devon, it is believed that cats born in
the month of May will catch no mice nor rats, but will, contrary to the
wont of all other cats, bring in snakes and slow-worms. Such cats are
called "May cats," and are held in contempt.

_Folk Lore of Wales_: _Shewri-while._--There is a legend connected with one
of the Monmouthshire mountains (_Mynydd Llanhilleth_), that was, until very
recently, implicitly believed by most of the residents in that
neighbourhood. They stated that the mountain was haunted by a spirit in the
form of a woman, and known by the name of "Shewri-while." Her principal
employment appears to have been misleading those whose business or
inclination led them across the mountain; and so powerful was her
influence, that few, even of those who resided in the neighbourhood, could
cross the mountain without losing their way. If some unlucky wanderer
hesitated in which direction to go, Shewri would attract his attention by a
loud "whoo-whoop," and with upraised arm beckon him on. If followed, she
glided on before him: sometimes allowing him to approach so near, that the
colour and arrangement of her dress could be distinguished; at other times,
she would only be seen at a distance, and then she frequently repeated her
call of "whoo-whoop." At length, after wandering over the mountain for
hours in the hope of overtaking her, she would leave her weary and
bewildered pursuer at the very spot from which he had first started.

_Charm for the Tooth-ache._--The following doggerel, to be written on a

  "When Peter sat at Jerusalems gate

  Ask counsel of Christ and follow me
  Of the tooth eake you shall be ever free
  Not you a Lone but also all those
  Who carry these few Laines safe under clothes
  In the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoste."

_Quinces._--In an old family memorandum-book, I find the following curious
entry:

    "Sept. 15. 1725. My Father Mr. ---- ---- brought my mother home to my
    grandfather's house, and the wedding dinner was kept there on Monday,
    Sept. 20., with all the family, and Mr. ---- and Mr. ---- and his wife
    were present.

    "In the Evening my Honoured Grandfather gave all his Children a serious
    admonition to live in Love and Charity ... and afterwards gave his wife
    a {21} present of some _Quinces_, and to his sister ----, and every Son
    and Daughter, Son in Law and Daughter in Law, Five Guineas each."

The last-named gift consisted of gold five-guinea pieces of Charles II. and
James II., some of which have been preserved in the family. The part of the
record, however, which appears to me worthy of note, is that which concerns
the _quinces_, which brings to one's mind the ancient Greek custom that the
bridegroom and bride should eat a _quince_ together, as a part of the
wedding ceremonies. (See Potter's _Grecian Antiquities_.)

Can any of your readers furnish any additional information on this curious
point?

ELIZABETH WALKER.--SHAKSPEARE.

I have before me a reprint (Blackwell, Sheffield, 1829) of _The Holy Life
of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, late Wife of A. Walker, D.D., Rector of Fyfield,
in Essex_, originally published by her husband in 1690. It is a beautiful
record of that sweet, simple, and earnest piety which characterised many of
the professors of religion in the seventeenth century. It is not, however,
the general character of the book, however excellent, but an incidental
allusion in the first section of it, that suggests this communication. The
good woman above named, and who was born in London in 1623, says, in her
Diary:

    "My dear father was John Sadler, a very eminent citizen. He was born at
    Stratford-upon-Avon, where his ancestors lived. My grandfather had a
    good estate in and about the town. He was of a free and noble spirit,
    which somewhat outreached his estate, but was not given to any
    debauchery that I ever heard of. My father's mother was a very wise,
    pious, and good woman, and lived and died a good Christian. My father
    had no brother, but three sisters who were all eminently wise and good
    women, especially his youngest sister."

It is, I confess, very agreeable to me, amidst the interest of association
created by the world-wide fame of the "Swan of Avon," to record this
pleasing tribute to the character of the _genius loci_ at so interesting a
period. In a passage on a subsequent page, Mrs. Walker, referring to some
spiritual troubles, says:

    "My father's sister, my dear aunt Quiney, a gracious good woman, taking
    notice of my dejected spirit, she waylaid me in my coming home from the
    morning exercise then in our parish."

This was in London: but it is impossible to have read attentively some of
the minuter memorials of Shakspeare (_e.g._ Hunter's, Halliwell's, &c.)
without recognising in "Aunt Quiney" a collateral relationship to the
immortal bard himself. I am not aware that any Shakspearian reader of the
"NOTES AND QUERIES" will feel the slightest interest in this remote branch
of a genealogical tree, which seems to have borne "diverse manner of
fruits;" but assuredly the better portion of those who most justly admire
its exuberance of dramatic yield, will not disparage their taste should
they equally relish the evangelical flavour of its "holier products,"
exemplified in the Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker.

OLD ENGLISH ACTORS AND MUSICIANS IN GERMANY.

(Vol. ii., pp. 184. 459.)

The following extracts furnish decisive evidence of the custom of our old
English actors' and musicians' professional peregrinations on the continent
at the beginning of the seventeenth century--a subject which has been ably
treated by Mr. Thoms in the _Athenaeum_ for 1849, p. 862.

In September, 1603, King James I. despatched the Lord Spenser and Sir
William Dethick, Garter King-at-arms, to Stuttgart, for the purpose of
investing the Duke of Wuertemberg with the ensigns of the Garter, he having
been elected into the order in the 39th year of the late Queen's reign. A
description of this important ceremony was published at Tubingen in 1605,
in a 4to. volume of 270 pages, by Erhardus Cellius, professor of poetry and
history at that University, entitled: "Eques auratus Anglo-Wirtembergicus."
At page 120. we are told that among the ambassador's retinue were "four
excellent musicians, with ten other assistants." (Four excellentes musici,
una cum decem ministris aliis.) These performed at a grand banquet given
after the Duke's investiture, and are described at p. 229. as "the royal
English music, which the illustrious royal ambassador had brought with him
to enhance the magnificence of the embassy and the present ceremony; and
who, though few in number, were eminently well skilled in the art. For
England produces many excellent musicians, commedians, and tragedians, most
skilful in the histrionic art; certain companies of whom quitting their own
abodes for a time, are in the habit of visiting foreign countries at
particular seasons, exhibiting and representing their art principally at
the courts of princes. A few years ago, some English musicians coming over
to our Germany with this view, remained for some time at the courts of
great princes; their skill both in music and in the histrionic art, having
procured them such favour, that they returned home beautifully rewarded,
and loaded with gold and silver."

(Musica Anglicana Regiae, quam Regius illustris Legatus secum ad Legationis
et actus huius magnificentiam adduxerat: non ita multos quidem sed
excellenter in hac arte versatos. Profert enim multos et praestantes Anglia
musicos, comoedos, tragaedos, histrionicae peritissimos, e quibus interdum
aliquot consociati sedibus {22} suis ad tempus relictis ad exteras nationes
excurrere, artemq'; suam illis praesertim Principum aulis demonstrare,
ostentareq'; consueverunt. Paucis ab hinc annis in Germaniam nostram
Anglicani musici dictum ob finem expaciati, et in magnorum Principum aulis
aliquandiu versati, tantum ex arte musica, histrionicaq'; sibi favorem
conciliarunt, ut largiter remunerati domum inde auro et argento onusti sint
reversi.)

Dancing succeeded the feast and then (p. 244.) "the English players made
their appearance, and represented the sacred history of _Susanna_, with so
much art of histrionic action, and with such dexterity, that they obtained
both praise and a most ample reward."

(Histriones Anglicani mature prodibant, et sacram Susannae historiam tanta
actionis histrionicae arte, tanta dexteritate representabant, ut et laudem
inde et praemium amplissimum reportarent.)

MINOR NOTES.

_The Curse of Scotland._--In Vol. i. p. 61., is a Query why the Nine of
Diamonds is called the Curse of Scotland. Reference is made to a print
dated Oct. 21, 1745, entitled "Briton's Association against the Pope's
Bulls," in which the young Pretender is represented attempting to lead
across the Tweed a herd of bulls laden with curses, excommunications,
indulgences, &c.: on the ground before them lies the Nine of Diamonds. In
p. 90. it is said that the "Curse of Scotland" is a corruption of the
"Cross of Scotland," and that the allusion is to St. Andrew's cross, which
is supposed to resemble the Nine of Diamonds. This explanation is
unsatisfactory. The _nine_ resembles St. Andrew's cross less than the
_five_, in a pack of cards; and, moreover, the nine of any other suit would
be equally applicable. The true explanation is evidently to be found in the
game of Pope Joan, in which the Nine of Diamonds is the pope. The
well-known antipapal spirit of the Scottish people caused the pope to be
called the Curse of Scotland.

The game of Pope Joan is stated to have been originally called Pope Julio,
and to be as old as the reign of Queen Elizabeth. See Sir John Harington's
"Treatise on Playe," written about 1597, Nugae Antiquae, vol. i. p. 220.

_George Herbert._--It is much to be desired that the suggestion thrown out
by your correspondent (Vol. ii., p. 460.) may be acted upon. The admirers
of George Herbert are doubtless so numerous, that the correct and complete
restoration of Bemerton Church might be effected by means of a small
subscription among them, as in the case of the Chaucer monument. Most
gladly would I aid in the good work.

_Dutch Versions of English Essayists._--How much the works of the British
Essayists were appreciated by my Dutch ancestors, the following plain facts
may show. I have now before me

A translation of the Tatler:

    "De Snapper, of de Britsche Tuchtmeester. Door den Ridder Richard
    Steele. Uit het Engelsch vertaald door P. le Clerc. t'Amsterdam, by
    Hendrik Vieroot, 1733, iv. vol. in 12º."

_Long Meg of Westminster_ (Vol. ii., p. 131.).--The same epithet has been
applied to women in other places. In the parish Register of Tiverton,
Devon, is the following entry:

    "Burials. April, 1596. The long Jone seruant to Mr. Demant's. iii.
    day."

Why should "long Meg" be more fabulous than "long Jone?"

_Errors in the Date of Printed Books._--In the title-page of Peter Heylin's
_Microcosmos_, 8th ed., the date is printed 1939 instead of 1639. In like
manner, in _Historical Applications and occasional Meditations upon several
Subjects, written by a Person of Honour_, printed in 1670, the imprimatur,
signed "Sam. Parker," is dated 1970, instead of 1670. In each of these
cases the error is evidently caused by the compositor having inverted the
figure 6, which thus became 9.

QUERIES.

DOUSA'S POEM ON SIDNEY.--OLD DUTCH SONG-BOOK.

Your correspondent, who subscribes himself JANUS DOUSA in the last number
of "NOTES AND QUERIES," ought to be able, and I dare say will be able, to
supply through your columns information of which I have been long in
search. In 1586 his great namesake printed at Lugd. Batav. a collection of
Greek and Latin poems upon dead and living persons of distinction. Geoffrey
Whitney, an Englishman, apparently residing at Leyden, and {23} who printed
two works there in his own language, has fifteen six-line stanzas preceding
Dousa's collection, and he subjoins to it a translation of a copy of
Dousa's verses on the Earl of Leicester. Of these I have a memorandum, and
they are not what I want; but what I am at a loss for is a copy of verses
by Dousa, in the same volume, upon Sir Philip Sidney. It is many years
since I saw the book, and I am not sure if there be not two copies of
verses to Sidney, in which he is addressed as _Princeps_; and if your
correspondent can furnish me with either, or both, I shall be much obliged
to him.

Will you allow me to put another question relating to an old Dutch
song-book that has lately fallen in my way; and though I can hardly expect
a man like JANUS DOUSA to know anything about such a trifle, it is on some
accounts a matter of importance to me, in connection with two early English
songs, and one or other of your many friends may not object to aid me. The
book is called _De zingende Lootsman of de Vrolyke Boer_, and it professes
to be the _tweede druk_: the imprint is _Te Amsteldam By S. en W. Koene,
Boekdrukkers, Boek en Papierverkoopers, op de Linde Gragt_. The information
I request is the date of the work, for I can find none; and whether any
_first part_ of it is known in England, and where?

You are probably aware that the Dutch adopted not a few of our early tunes,
and they translated also some of our early songs. These I am anxious to
trace.

_Private Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth._--Several years ago I met with a book
bearing this, or a similar title, upon one of the tables of the reading
room of the British Museum. A passing glance made me anxious to refer to it
at a future opportunity. But, although I have again and again searched
through the Catalogues, and made anxious inquiries of the attendants in the
reading-room, I have never yet been able to catch a glimpse of it. Can any
of your correspondents furnish me with the correct title, and state whether
it is still preserved in this national library?

_Invention of Steam Power._--The following doggerel is the burden of a
common street-ditty, among the boys of Campden, in Gloucestershire.

    "Jonathan Hulls,
    With his paper skulls,
  Invented a machine
  To go against wind and stream;
    But he, being an ass,
    Couldn't bring it to pass,
  And so was asham'd to be seen."

Now this Jonathan Hulls was the great grandfather of a man of the same
name, now residing in Campden; so that if there be any truth in the
tradition, the application of steam power to the propulsion of hulls must
be long prior to the time of _Watts his name!_

Can any reader of NOTES AND QUERIES throw any light on the inventions of
this man Hulls?

NOCAB.

_Mythology of the Stars._--I want (in perfect {24} ignorance whether there
is such a book) a "Mythology of the Stars." Considering how often persons
of sound mind express an enthusiasm for the celestial bodies, and exclaim,
of clear night, that the stars are the poetry of Heaven, it is wonderful
how little most of us know about them. Nine out of ten educated persons
would be quite unable to do more than point out the Great Bear and North
Star.

If there is not, there _ought_ to be, some collection of the nomenclature
and mythological history of the heavens, with a familiar treatise on
astrology ancient and modern. The Chaldeans, Egyptians, Grecians, Arabs,
Celts, and Norsemen, must have had names and stories, whose relation (both
in itself and to one another) would make a very pretty volume either of
poetry or prose. Perhaps some of your readers may be able to inform me of
such a work, or where detached masses of the information I want could be
found.

_Sword of William the Conqueror._--Can any one inform me where is the sword
of William the Conqueror? It was kept in Battle Abbey till the dissolution,

_Neville Family._--Will any of your correspondents inform me what family of
the Nevilles were connected by marriage with the Fleetwoods or Cromwells?

In a collateral note in my family pedigree, I find it stated, that Sarah
Neville (who married Thomas Burkitt, in 1683) was cousin to General Charles
Fleetwood, who married Bridget Cromwell, daughter of the Protector; and, on
the cover of a book, I find written--

    "My Cozen Fleetwood he gave me this book.--Sarah Burkitt, 1684."

I have also traditional testimony in possessing a valuable cabinet, known
us "the Fleetwood;" and a portrait of the above Bridget Cromwell; both of
which have been preserved in the family for more than a century and a half,
and supposed to have passed into their possession by the marriage of Sarah
Neville.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES BY R.G.

(Vol. ii., p. 422.).

_Pagnini's Bible._--I have before me a 12mo. copy of _Liber Psalmorum
Davidis. Tralatio Duplex Vetus et Nova_. It contains also the Songs of
Moses, Deborah, etc., with annotations. In the title-page, the new
translation is said to be that of Pagnini. It was printed by Robert
Stephens, and is dated on the title-page "1556," and in the colophon "1557,
cal. Jan."

In this edition, both the old and new versions have the _verses
distinguished by cyphers_ (numerals). I have not the means of knowing
whether, in the earlier editions of Pagnini's Bible, the verses are so
distinguished; but I gather from R.G. that they are.

The writer of the article "BIBLE" in Rees's _Cyclopaedia_, says that R.
Stephens reprinted Pagnini's Bible in folio, with the Vulgate, in 1557. And
it appears, from my copy of the Psalms of David, that he also printed that
part of Pagnini's Bible in 12mo. in the same year, 1557--the colophon
probably containing the correct date.

Your pages have recommended that communications should be made of MS. notes
and remarks found in fly-leaves, margins, etc. of printed books; and the
above is written, partly in confirmation of Pagnini's title to the honour
of distinguishing the verses of the Bible with cyphers, as suggested by
R.G., but chiefly to note that there is written with a pen, in my copy, the
word "Vetus" over the column which contains the old, or Vulgate, and the
words "Pagnini _sive_ Ariae Montani" over the column containing the new
version of the first psalm.

The writer in Rees's _Cyclopaedia_, above referred to, says, that "in the
number of Latin Bibles is also usually ranked the version of the same
Pagninus, corrected, or rather rendered literal by {25} Arias Montanus."
But in the title-page of my copy Montanus is not mentioned.

My copy belonged to Jo. Sheldrake (who was he?) in 1663; to D. Hughes, of
Queen's College, Cambridge, in 1761; and to E. Tymewell Bridges (as the
family name was then spelled) in 1777. The latter was a brother of the late
Sir S. Egerton Br_y_dges. But the MS. note above mentioned does not seem to
be in the handwriting of either of them.

Will some learned reader of your work let me know whether there be any, and
what ground for attributing the new translation, as it stands in this
volume, to Montanus; or as Pagnini's corrected by Montanus?

THE FROZEN HORN.

(Vol. ii., p. 262.)

The quotation from Heylin is good; "the amusing anecdote from Munchausen"
may be better; but the personal testimony of Sir John Mandeville is best of
all, and, if I am not mistaken, as true a traveller's lie as ever was told.
Many years ago I met with an extract from his antiquated volume, of which,
having preserved no copy, I cannot give the admirable verbiage of the
fourteenth century, but must submit for it the following tame translation
in the flat English of our degenerate days.

long. ***, the cold was so intense, that for a while whatever was spoken on
board the vessel became frost-bound, and remained so, till, after certain
days, there came a sudden thaw, which let loose the whole rabblement of
sounds and syllables that had been accumulating during the suspense of
audible speech; but now fell clattering down like hailstones about the ears
of the crew, not less to their annoyance than the embargo had been to their
dismay. Among the unlucky revelations at this denouement, the author
gravely states that a rude fellow (the boatswain, I think), having cursed
the knight himself in a fit of passion, his sin then found him out, and was
promptly visited by retributive justice, in the form of a sound flogging.
If this salutary moral of the fable be not proof sufficient to authenticate
both the fact in natural history, and the veracity of the narrator, I know
nothing in the world of evidence that could do so. It may be added, that
the author of _Hudibras_, in his significant manner, alludes to the popular
belief of such an atmospheric phenomenon in the following couplet:

  "Where Truth in person doth appear,
  Like words congeal'd in northern air."
                  _Hudibras_, Book i. Canto i.

It is possible that Zachary Grey, in his copiously illustrated edition of
the poem, may have quoted Sir John Mandeville's account of this notable
adventure, in his wanderings, like a true knight-errant, through Scythia,
Armenia, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Media, Persia, Chaldea, Greece, Dalmatia,
Belgium, &c. He wrote an Itinerary of his travels in English, French, and
Latin. In these he occupied nearly forty years, and was long supposed to
have died in the course of them, but (as if his person had been "congealed
in northern air" and suddenly thawed into warm life again) when he
re-appeared, his friends with difficulty recognised him.

DOMINICALS

(Vol. ii., p 154.)

I believe to have been that kind of customary payment or oblations made _on
Sundays_ to the rector, or his vicegerent, of the church where a person
heard divine service and received the sacraments:

    "Hostiensis dicit quod in praecipuis festivitatibus tenetur quis
    offerre, et _cogi potest_; maxime cum sit quasi _generalis consuetudo
    ubique terrarum_ ... et intelligit festivitates praecipuas, _dies
    Dominicos_, et alios dies festivos."--Lyndwood, _Prov._, p. 21., not.
    e., ed. Oxon. 1679.

Though Lyndwood himself, as I understand him, seems to doubt the cardinal's
statement, that the payment could be _enforced_, unless sanctioned by local
custom.

Ducange, in v. "Denarius," 8vo. ed., Adel. 1774, says, the "Denarius de
Palma" and "Denarius Dominicalis" were the same:

    "Habebit (vicarius) cum eis victum suum competentem, et ad vestes sibi
    emendas XL. solidos Andegavenses, et _Denarium singulis diebus
    Dominicis ecclesiastica consuetudine offerendum_."

On this extract from a charter he observes:

    "Erat itaque _Denarius de Palma_, ille qui singulis Diebus Dominicis et
    [lege a] fidelibus offerrebatur. Cur autem dictus 'de Palma' non
    constat, nisi forte sic dictus fuerit quod in manum seu _palmam_
    traderetur." _Denarius Dominicalis_, idem.--Arest. MS. a. 1407.

It would seem also from his definition to be the same as the payment called
"Denaria Sacramentorum," that is:

    "iidem denarii qui _singulis offerrebantur Dominicis_, ideoque
    Sacramentorum dicti, quod tempore Sacrosancti Missae Sacrificii, pro
    excellentia interdum nude appellati Sacramentum, a fidelibus
    offerrentur."--_Annal. Bened._, t. iv. p. 466., n. 80. ad annum 1045.

These extracts sufficiently explain, perhaps, the payment known by the
different names of "Dominicals," "Palm-penny," and "Sacrament-pence;" and
still indicated, probably, by the weekly offertory of our communion
service.

Of a kindred nature were the "Denarii pro Requestis," or "Denarii
perquisiti," sometimes also {26} called "Denarii memoriales," pence paid
for masses in memory of the dead: called "pro requestis," because they were
obtained by special petition [requesta] from the curate; and "perquisiti,"
"perquisite pence," because they were demanded [perquirebantur] from the
devotion of the parishioners, over and above the customary offerings. And
in this, perhaps, we find the origin of our word "perquisite." (Lyndw.
_Prov._ p. 111., notes c, e. and p. 237.)

In further illustration of this subject, I will quote the following note
from Mr. Dansey's learned work _Horae Decanicae Rurales_, vol. i., p. 426.,
ed. 1844, which refers also to Blomefield's _Norfolk_, vol. iv. p. 63.:

    "A.D. 1686. The dean of the deanery of the city of Norwich was
    committed to custody, on one occasion, by the itinerant justices, for
    exacting _hallidays toll_ by his sub-dean in too high a manner; but on
    his proving that he took of every great boat that came up to the city
    on a holiday 1d. only, and of each small one a _halfpenny_; of every
    cart 1d., and of every horse or man laden an _halfpenny_; and of all
    bakers, butchers, and fishmongers, that sold their commodities on a
    holiday, 1d. each; and that his predecessors always had immemorially
    taken it, he was discharged.--Something of the same kind is related, in
    T. Martin's MS. history, respecting the dues exacted by the rural dean
    of Thetford. Dr. Sutton's MS. Letter."

MEDAL STRUCK BY CHARLES XII.--RUDBECK'S ATLANTICA.

Although no numismatist, yet, being resident at Stockholm, I have taken
steps to enable me to reply to L.'s Query (Vol. ii., p. 408. of "NOTES AND
QUERIES") respecting Charles XII.'s medal in commemoration of the victory
at Holowzin.

No copy of the medal exists in the cabinet of the Royal Museum of
Antiquities; but in that belonging to the National Bank, there is a very
fine example of it in copper, and the inscriptions are as follow:

    On the Reverse:--"_Silvae. Paludes. Aggeres. Hostes. Victi._"

    In the Exergue:--"_Moschi ad Holowzinum victi A. 1708 3/14 Jul._"

And round the margin the verse from Lucan in question:

  "_Victrices Copias Alium Laturus In Orbem_:"

with the substitution of _copias_ for _aquilas_, recorded by Voltaire and
criticised by L.

The same inscriptions are given in Bergh's _Beskrifning oefver Svenska mynt
och Skaedepenningar_, 4to., Upsala, 1773; only he adds, that the inscription
in the margin is only found on some copies.

I may transcribe Bergh's description in full:

    "Slagetvid Holofsin.

    '119. Konungens Bild och hamnunder Armen NAT. 17. JUN. 1682, SILVAE.

    Has any one of these three copies a separate
      leaf, entitled _Ad Bibliopegos?_
    If so, which of them?
    Has the copy with the date 1679 _Testimonia_ at the end?
    If so, how many pages do they consist of?
    Have they a separate title and a separate
      sheet of _errata?_
    Is there a duplicate copy of this separate title
      at the end of the Preface?
  Tomus ii. 1689
    How many pages of _Testimonia_ are there at
      the end of the Preface?

Is there, in any one of these volumes, the name of any former owner, any
book number, or any other mark by which they can be recognised (for
instance, that of the Duke de la Valliere)?

Should there be any other copy of any one of these tomes in the British
Museum, these questions will extend to that volume also.

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

_Fossil Deer (not Elk) of Ireland, C. Megaceros_ (Vol. ii., p. 494.).--Your
correspondent W.R.C. will find in Mr. Hart's description of a skeleton of
this animal (Dublin, 1825), in a pamphlet, published by W. Richardson
(Dublin, 1846, M'Glashan), in Professor Owen's _British Fossil Mammalia_,
and in the _Zoologist_ (Van Voorst) for 1847 and for 1848, p. 2064., all
that is known and much that has been imagined on the subject of his
inquiry. The rib which he mentions is well known, and is in fact one of the
principal bones of contention between the opposing theorists. I never
before heard the story of the specimen shot in 1533, although several years
ago I devoted some time to the subject. I am inclined to suspect that it
must have been found in some Irish manuscript which has been discovered,
since (in the year 1847) some bones of the fossil deer were found in a
certain {27} lake in the west of Ireland in company with those of a turkey.

"_Away, let nought to Love displeasing_" (Vol. ii., p. 519.).--This song,
usually entitled "_Winifreda_," has been attributed to Sir John Suckling,
but with what justice I am unable to say.

It has also acquired additional interest from having been set to music by
the first Earl of Mornington, the father of the Duke of Wellington.

The author should certainly be known; and perhaps some of your
correspondents can furnish a clue by which he may be discovered.

    "Sindon pro specie panni [Byssus tenuis], etc."

It was a manufacture that was used for dresses as well as hangings, and is
constantly mentioned in inventories and descriptions of the middle ages.

_Coleridge and the Penny Post_ (Vol. iii., p. 6.).--Mr. Venables asks a
question in a way that may lead the reader to infer an answer, and an
ungenerous answer; and he calls on Mr. Hill to give him satisfaction, as if
Mr. Hill had nothing better to do than to inform Mr. Venables, and correct
Miss Martineau's blunders. If Mr. Venables had taken an active part in
bringing about the greatest moral movement of our age, he would have known
that, amongst the hundred other illustrations adduced by Mr. Hill, was the
very anecdote to which he refers; and that Mr. Hill quoted it, not once or
twice, but dozens of times, and circulated it, with Coleridge's name, over
the whole length and breadth of the three kingdoms, by tens of thousands of
printed papers. Mr. Hill has not had a tithe of the honour he deserves--and
never will have--and I cannot remain silent, and see his character
questioned, though in matters too trifling, I think, even to have occupied
a corner in "NOTES AND QUERIES."

_Circulation of the Blood_ (Vol. ii., p. 475.).--The passage in Venerable

sive de Phlebotomia_; (which occurs in the folio editions, Basle, vol. i.
p. 472.; Colon., vol. i. p. 898.). In the enumeration of the veins from
which blood may be taken, he says,--

    "De brachio tres, _qui per totum corpus reddunt sanguinem_, capitanea
    linea, matricia, capsale."

The subject of bleeding is again referred to in _Eccl. Hist._, vol. iii,

_True Blue_ (Vol. ii., p. 494.).--From documents relative to the wars of

bunches fastened to their _blue bonnets_ and that the border English
nicknamed them "_blue caps_" and "jockies." Hence the phrase, "True blue
Presbyterian."

_Darcy Lever Church_ (Vol. ii., p. 494.), which is referred to by your
correspondent, is the first instance, I believe, of the application of a
new material to the construction of an ecclesiastical edifice. It is built
throughout, walls, tower, and spire, benches and fittings, of terra cotta
from the Ladyshore works. The architect is that accomplished antiquary, Mr.
Sharpe of Lancaster, who furnished the designs of every part, from which
moulds were made, and in these the composition forming the terra cotta was
prepared, and hardened by the application of fire. The style is the purest
and richest Second Pointed, and the effect of the pierced work of the spire
is, as your correspondent observes, very fine when seen from a distance.
There is a rich colour, too, in the material, which has a remarkably
pleasing result upon the eye. But a nearer approach destroys the charm. It
is found to be a "sham." The lines of the mouldings, mullions, etc., are
warped by the heat attendant upon the process of the manufacture. The
exquisite sharpness of outline produced by the chisel is wanting, and there
is (in consequence of the impossibility of undercutting) an absence of that
effect of light and shade which is the characteristic of the mediaeval
carvings. The greatest shock is, however, experienced on an examination of
the interior. What at first sight appear to be highly elaborated oaken
bench-ends and seats are only painted earthenware. In point of fact, it is
a POT CHURCH. A similar and larger {28} structure by the same architect,
and in the same material, has been erected near Platt Hall, in the parish
of Manchester.

J.H.P. LERESCHE.

The church at Lever Bridge, near Darcy Lever Hall, on the line of railway
between Normanton and Bolton, was built about seven years since. The
architect is Edward Sharpe, Esq., of Lancaster. The material of the entire
structure, including the internal fittings, is terra cotta, from the
Ladyshore works in the neighbourhood, where a model of the church, in the
same material, is in preparation for the Exhibition of 1851.

_Lines attributed to Henry Viscount Palmerston_ (Vol. i., p. 382.).--Having
been absent for some time, I have not been able to see whether any one has
answered a Query I put, viz:--

    "Who was the author of those lines beginning with--

  'Stranger! whoe'er thou art that views this tomb,' etc.

which Porson translated into Greek Iambics, beginning with--

  [Greek: O xeine, touton hostis eisoras taphon] etc."

A friend, who was senior medallist in his time at Cambridge, tells me that
tradition said that the lines were set by the Rev. R. Collier, Hebrew
Professor and Examiner at Trinity College; and that it is supposed that
Collier found them in some magazine of the day.

With reference to the imposition supposed to be set Porson (Vol. ii., p.
71.), and shown by C. at p. 106. to be by Joshua Barnes, I question whether
any imposition were ever set him: for I have heard Mr. Summers (Porson's
first instructor) observe, that he was a well-conducted man during the
whole of his undergraduateship; others have reported the same of him.

_Defender of the Faith_ (Vol. ii., pp. 442. 481.).--In _Collectanea

    "maide the xxijth daye of Januarye, in the second yeare of the reagne
    of King Henry the seaventhe, by the graice of God Kinge of England,
    _defendoure of the faithe_," etc.

The lessor, Christopher Ratlife, of Hewick, died before 10 Henry VII., and
the editor of the above work says, "It is impossible to account for the
peculiarity in the date of this deed."

Bishop Burnet cites Spelman as asserting that several of the kings of
England before Henry VIII. had borne the title of "Defender of the Faith."
A correspondent of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ (N.S. xvi. 357.) conjectures
that the name of Spelman had been inadvertently substituted for the name of
Selden; though he justly remarks, that Selden by no means countenances the
assertion of the bishop.

the word translated _shepherd_ be _pasteur_ or not, I cannot say, as I have
not either of the works he alludes to; but certain it is that the Rev. Mr.
Farquharson, _minister_ of Alford, only recently deceased, was well known
as a meteorological observer; and it is to him, doubtless, that Professor
Koenitz refers.

the passages may be easily found.

H.G.T.

_Painting by C. Bega_ (Vol. ii., p. 494.).--The translation of the lines
is, I believe,

    "We Sing certainly what is new, and have still a prize." "A Cracknel is
    our gain, but the ditty must first (come) out."

In modern Dutch most probably,

    "Wy singen vast wat nienw, en hebben nog een buit. Een Krakeling is
    onze winst maar het Liedker moet eerst uit."

I should think there is a lake somewhere in the picture, and the lines are
probably part of an old Dutch song. As to the painter C. Bega, I have at
hand a Catalogue of the Munich Gallery, and find there "Cornelius Bega,
geb. 1620, gest. 1664." His picture is described as "Eine Rauch- und
Trinkgesellschaft belustiget sich mit Tanz in einer Schenke." In a
Catalogue of the Louvre, I have the following description:

    "Bega, Corneille ou Cornille, ne a Harlem en 1620, mort de la peste
    dans la meme ville en 1664; eleve d'Adrien Van Ostade."

His picture is

    "Interieur d'un menage rustique. Un homme et une femme sont assis pres
    d'une table."

His subjects appear to be generally of the character of the painting
possessed by your correspondent.

_Herstmonceux_ (Vol. ii., p. 478.).--Question 4. In the Privy Seal writs of

Bethlehem." It was for forty monks of the Cistercian order.

{29} Question 5. In the _Battle of Agincourt_, by Sir H. Nicolas, Sir Rover
Fyene's name is given amongst the retinue of Henry V. He was accompanied by
eight men-at-arms and twenty-four archers. Sir Roger "Ffynys," accompanied
by ten of his men-at-arms and forty archers, also followed Henry (in the
suite of Lord Willoughby d'Eresby) in his second continental expedition.

Esq., member for Colchester in the second parliaments of George I. and II.
He died in 1749. He had been a commander in the service of the East India

whether he is of the family or not I cannot say. He is described as "Edward

_Swords used in Dress_ (Vol. i. 415.; vol. ii. 110. 213. 388.).--Might it
not have happened that swords went out of fashion after the middle of the
last century, and were revived towards its close? In old prints from 1700
to 1720, they appear to have been universally worn; later they are not so
general. In 1776-90, they appear again. My grandmother (born in 1760) well
remembers her brother, of nearly her own age, wearing a sword, say about
1780. Some of Fielding's heroes wore "hangers."

_Swearing by Swans_ (Vol. ii., pp. 392. 451.).--Though I can give no reason
why the birds of Juno should have been invoked as witnesses to an oath, the
Query about them has suggested to me what may perhaps appear rather an
irrelevant little note.

Cooper, in his _Raven's Nest_, makes Mr. Aristobulus Brag use the
provincialism "_I swanny_;" "by which," observes the author, "I suppose he
meant--_I swear!_" Of course, this has nothing to do with swearing by
swans, more than sounding like it; argument of sound being very different
from sound argument. Mr. Cooper does not seem to have given a thought to
the analysis of the phrase, which is no oath, merely an innocent
asseveration. "I's-a-warrant-ye" (perhaps when resolved to its
ungrammatical elements, "I is a warranty to ye") proceeds through
"I's-a-warnd-ye," "I's-warn-ye" (all English provincialisms,) to its remote
transatlantic ultimatum of debasement in "_I swanny_."

_Mildew in Books_ (Vol. ii., p. 103).--In reply to B., who inquires for a
prevention for _mildew in books_, I send the following receipt, which I
have copied from a book containing many others:--"Take a feather dipt in
spirits of wine, and lightly wash over the backs and covers. To prevent
mould, put a little into writing ink."

Another to take _mildew out of linen_.--"Mix powdered starch and soft soap
with half the quantity of bay salt; mix it with vinegar, and lay it on both
sides with a painter's brush. Then let it lie in the open air till the
spots are out."

By the way, is not the "lanycoll" (so called, I presume, from the froth
like wool (_lana_) at the neck (_collum_) of the vessel), mentioned in the
old ballad of "King Edward and the Shepherd" (Hartshorne's _Met. Tales_, p.
54.), the same beverage as "lamb's-wool?"

casual visitor, and which {30} certainly appears to be the "iter
processionale" referred to in the will of William Ryder. Any information as
to the subject of the good woman's tradition would be very acceptable.
Perhaps S.S.S. will allow me, in return for his satisfactory explanation of
the "dark passage" in question, to over a very luminous passage in
confirmation of his view of Goldsmith's.

H.G.T.

_Lights on the Altar_ (Vol. ii., p. 495.).--In the 42nd canon of those
enacted under King Edgar (Thorpe's _Ancient Laws and Institutes of
England_, vol. ii. pp. 252-3.) we find:--

    "Let there be always burning lights in the church when mass is
    singing."

And in the 14th of the canons of AElfric (pp. 348-9. of the same volume):--

    "Acoluthus he is called, who bears the candle or taper in God's
    ministries when the Gospel is read, or when the housel is hallowed at
    the altar: not to dispel, as it were, the dim darkness, but, with that
    light, to announce bliss, in honour of Christ who is our light."

C.W.G.

_Time when Herodotus wrote_ (Vol. ii., p. 405.).--The passage quoted by
your correspondent A.W.H. affords, I think, a reasonable argument to prove
that Herodotus did not commence his work until an advanced age; most
probably between the ages of seventy and seventy-seven years. Moreover,
there are various other reasons to justify the same conclusion; all which
A.W.H. will find stated in Dr. Smith's _Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Biography and Mythology_, vol. ii. I believe A.W.H. is correct in his
supposition that the passage has not been noticed before.

T.H. KERSLEY, A.B.

King William's College.

_Adur_ (Vol. ii., p. 108.).--The connexion of the Welsh _ydwr_ with the
Greek [Greek: hydor] is remarkable. Can any of your readers tell me whether
there be not an older Welsh word for _water_? There are, I know, two sets
of Welsh numerals, of which the later contains many Greek words, but the
older are entirely different. Is not _cader_ akin to [Greek: kathedra], and
_glas_ to [Greek: glaukos]?

J.W.H.

_The Word "Alarm"_ (Vol. ii., pp. 151. 183.).--I send you an instance of
the accurate use of the word "alarm" which may be interesting. In an
account of the attempt made on the 29th of Oct. 1795, to assassinate Geo.
III., the Earl of Onslow (as cited in Maunder's _Universal Biog._ p. 321.)
uses the following expression:--

    "His Majesty showed, and, I am persuaded, felt, no alarm; much less did
    he fear."

Is not this a good instance of the true difference of meaning in these two
words, which are now loosely used as if strictly synonymous?

H.G.T.

_The Conquest_ (Vol. ii., p 440).--W.L. is informed that I have before me
several old parchment documents or title-deeds, in which the words "post
conquestum" are used merely to express (as part of their dates) the year
after the accession of those kings respectively in whose reigns those
documents were made.

P.H.F.

_Land Holland_ (Vol. ii., p. 267. 345.).--J.B.C. does not say in what part
of England he finds this term used. Holland, in Lincolnshire, is by Ingulph
called _Hoiland_, a name which has been thought to mean _hedgeland_, in
allusion to the sea-walls or hedges by which it was preserved from
inundation. Other etymologies have also been proposed. (See Gough's
_Camden_, "Lincolnshire.") In Norfolk, however, the term _olland_ is used,
Forby tells us, for "arable land which has been laid down in grass more
than two years, q.d. _old-land_." In a Norfolk paper of few months since,
in an advertisement of a ploughing match, I observe a prize is offered "To
the ploughman, with good character, who shall plough a certain quantity of
_olland_ within the least time, in the best manner."

MISCELLANEOUS.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

The Camden Society have just issued to the members a highly important
volume, Walter Mapes _De Nugis Curialium_. The best idea of the interesting
character of this work may be formed from the manner in which it is
described by its editor, Mr. Thomas Wright, who speaks of it as "the book
in which this remarkable man seems to have amused himself with putting down
his own sentiments on the passing events of the day, along with the popular
gossip of the courtiers with whom he mixed;" and as being "one mass of
contemporary anecdote, romance, and popular legend, interesting equally by
its curiosity and by its novelty." There can be little doubt that the work
will be welcomed, not only by the members of the Camden Society, but by all
students of our early history and all lovers of our Folk Lore.

Though we do not generally notice the publication of works of fiction, the
handsome manner in which, in the third volume of his _Bertha, a Romance of
the Dark Ages_, Mr. MacCabe has thought right to speak of the information
which he obtained, during the progress of his work, through the medium of
NOTES AND QUERIES, induces us to make an exception in favour of his highly
interesting story. At the same time, that very acknowledgment almost
forbids our speaking in such high terms as we otherwise should of the power
with which Mr. MacCabe has worked up this striking narrative, which take
its name from Bertha, the wife of the profligate Henry IV. of Germany; and
of which the main incidents turn on Henry's deposition of the Pope, and his
consequent excommunication by the inflexible Gregory the Seventh. But we
the less regret this necessity of speaking thus moderately, since it must
be obvious that when an accomplished scholar like the {31} author of the
_Catholic History of England_, to whom old chronicles are as household
words, chooses to weave their most striking passages into a romance, his
work will be of a very different stamp from that of the ordinary novelist,
who has hunted over the same chronicles for the mere purpose of finding
startling incidents. The one will present his readers, as Mr. MacCabe has
done, with a picture uniform in style and consistent in colouring, while
the other will at best only exhibit a few brilliant scenes, which, like the
views in a magic lanthorn, will owe as much of their brilliancy to the
darkness with which they are contrasted as to the skill of the artist.

Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell, on Wednesday next and three following
days, the valuable Collection of Coins and Medals of the Rev. Dr. Neligan,
of Cork; and on the following Monday that gentleman's highly interesting
Antiquities, Illuminated MSS., Ancient Glass, Bronzes, Etruscan and Roman
Pottery, Silver Ring Money, &c.

To those who have never studied what Voltaire maliciously designated "the
science of fools with long memories," but yet occasionally wish to know the
families which have borne certain mottoes, the new edition of _The Book of
Mottoes_ will be a very acceptable source of information.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
