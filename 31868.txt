                            Red Riding Hood

                            [Illustration]



           Entered according to Act of Congress in the year
             1863, by L. PRANG & CO. in Clerk's office of
                      the district court of Mass.



    [Illustration]

    There was a lonely cabin
    Within a dark, old wood,
    And in it, with her mother
    There dwelt Red Riding Hood.

    The tall old trees above them
    Their winter fire supplied
    When Autumn's flaming sunsets
    From their red leaves had died.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    The rippling brook, their water
    From far off mountains brought;
    And prattled of their summits
    In icy statues wrought.

    For them, the squirrels hoarded
    Their nuts in hollow trees;
    And pounds of sweetest honey
    Were made them by the bees;

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    To gather these together
    Was work enough to do;
    Little Red Riding Hood thought so,
    An so, no doubt, would you.

    Blushing beneath her fingers
    Looked up the berries red;
    The flowers seemed to know her
    And listened for her tread.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    For she was good and loving
    And beautiful as good,
    With daily acts of kindness,
    Little Red Riding Hood.

    Afar off, in the forest,
    There lived her grandam old;
    And she was poor and needy,
    And often sick and cold.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    And once a week, her grandchild
    Would walk the lonely wood,
    And carry little bundles
    Of faggots and of food.

    One morn the mother started
    The maid upon her way,
    And said, "now you must carry
    To grandmamma to day."

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    "This little pot of butter
    I've churned so nice and sweet;
    And mind not stop and prattle
    With any one you meet!"

    Then through the shady forest
    The little maiden went;
    And though her steps were fleetest,
    The day was well nigh spent,

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    When nearby through her journey,
    An old, gaunt Wolf she spied,
    Who wagged his tail, and humbly
    Came walking by her side;

    And said, "my little maiden,
    How very fair you are!
    You really look quite handsome!
    Where do you walk so far?"

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    Forgetful of her mother,
    She stopped and told him where;
    Then said the Wolf, so cunning,
    "What is it that you bear?"

    Forgetful of her mother,
    She stood and told him what;
    "Tis butter, for my grandma,
    Packed nicely in this pot."

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    Then said the Wolf, "good by dear;
    Perhaps we'll meet again!"
    Then swiftly on he hastened,
    Swiftly through dale and glen,

    And running reached before her
    The cabin grey and old;
    Her grandmamma was absent--
    He quickly did infold

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    Himself in cap and night gown
    Then quickly on the bed,
    Closely upon the pillow
    He laid his grizzly head.

    Red Riding Hood soon entered;
    "O, grandmamma, see here!
    A little pot of butter!"
    Where is my grandma dear?

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    "Here," said the Wolf, well feigning,
    Her grandma's voice, so weak;
    "I'm here, so sick my darling,
    That I can scarcely speak!"

    "Take off your clothes my darling,
    Upon the bed come lie;
    When you are here beside me
    I'll be better by and by!"

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    Red Riding Hood obeyed her
    And got upon the bed;
    "O grandmamma how altered
    You are!" she quickly said

    "O what GREAT EYES my grandma!
    They never looked so before--"
    "That's to see you the better my darling,
    The larger, to see you more!"

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    "What a GREAT NOSE my grandma
    It never looked so before!"
    "That's to smell you better, my darling;
    The larger to smell you more!"

    "And what GREAT HANDS my grandma
    They never looked so before!"
    "That's to hold you tight my darling
    And to hug you more and more!"

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    "What a GREAT MOUTH my grandma!
    As large as your tin cup!"
    "That's to open wide my beauty
    And then to eat you up!"

    Then he opened his great mouth wider
    To eat her like a bird
    But at that dreadful moment
    A hunter's gun was heard

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    The Wolf fell dead and bleeding--
    Then grandma hastened in--
    For she had seen the peril
    The danger that had been!

    Red Riding Hood wept sadly
    And sorrowed more and more,
    That she'd disobeyed her mother--
    Which she never did before.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

    And she thought with fear & trembling
    Of the death that came so near!
    And she said the fright had taught her
    To mind her mother dear.

    Then listen, all ye children,
    And mind your mother's word!
    For the great WOLF, men call EVIL
    Is prowling round unheard!

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
