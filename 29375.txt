Ice for Commercial Purposes

Ice for commercial purposes is obtained in two ways: either by cutting
during the winter time from our lakes and rivers and storing in large
Ice Storage Houses located alongside, or by freezing pure clean water
by means of artificial refrigeration.

All authorities are agreed that artificial ice is more sanitary than
natural ice and it is only a matter of time when the use of natural
ice will be prohibited except in special cases when the purity of its
source of supply is beyond doubt.

Our improved method of making artificial ice will cut the labor cost
down to the minimum and will enable the manufacturer to profitably
sell artificial ice at the price natural ice can be harvested. The
logical result thereof will be the building of a large number of
modern ice plants all over the country to supply the market with
artificial ice in place of the present natural ice.

We do not claim any wonders for our system but believe that the
following points of advantage will convince any practical ice
manufacturer that the labor cost has been cut in two.

  First. We pull a complete row of the full width of tank at one time.

  Second. Our air supply is permanently connected to the cans and the
  supply to each can can be regulated, if required.

  Third. We have a continuous air supply to the cans during freezing
  as well as during thawing, dumping and filling. Our air supply never
  ceases.

  Fourth. Our air is automatically cooled down to the temperature of
  the brine in the tank thereby eliminating all possibility of
  moisture in the air pipes.

  Fifth. Our cans are held in a solid frame of steel work and are
  connected to the crane from the time the cans are pulled until they
  are put back into the tanks, thereby doubling the life of the cans.

We give herewith data covering the cost of manufacturing ice and will
guarantee that under reasonably fair management the number of men
required will not be exceeded.

Do not fail to carefully analyze the following cost data. They may seem
extremely low but a thorough study of our system will prove them to be
very conservative.

Manufacturing Costs Per Ton of Ice
Using Electric Power at Present Chicago
Rates for Power and Labor

Capacity of plant, 240 tons of ice per day, using 2692 cans of 400-lb.
capacity.

18000-ton storage house.

Average current requirement for freezing one ton of ice, including
storage cooling and all auxiliaries, 55 K. W. hours.

Average cost per K. W. hour, .9 cent.

Current cost per ton of ice, 55 x .9, equals 49.6 cents.

Assuming one month's shut-down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 240 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 79,920 tons, or
roughly speaking 80,000 tons of ice.

Adding 1/2 cent per ton of ice for the required heating, the total
power cost of  making 80,000 tons of ice is (80,000 x .50)

                                              $ 40,000.00

ENGINE ROOM LABOR COST:

1 chief engineer per day      $ 10.00

3 engineers per day            $ 8.00

Total per day                 $ 34.00

365 days at $34.00 equals                     $ 12,410.00


or  12410 / 80000 = 15.62 cents per ton

ICE PLANT LABOR COST:

3 men pulling ice and setting
  it up in store-room.         per day $ 6.00

3 men in store-room            per day $ 6.00

1 shipping clerk               per day $ 8.00

Total labor                   per day $ 44.00

365 days at $44.00 equals                              16,060.00

For filling the winter
storage house and taking
the ice out of it will
require 3 additional men
for five months,
equals 150 days x $18.00, equals                      $ 2,700.00

           Total Ice Plant Labor Cost Equals          $18,760.00

or  18670 / 80000 = 23.46 cents per ton

240 tons of ice equal 1200---400-lb. cans. As 24 cans are pulled at
one time it requires 1200 / 24 = 50 pulls per day, or one pull every
29 minutes. The ice-puller has therefore ample time to set up all ice
pulled in storage house as directed.

Cost of Ammonia at         2 cent per ton     $ 1,600.00

Cost of Oil and Waste at   2 cent per ton     $ 1,600.00

During the month of December, the Ice Plant will be shut down for
overhauling and repairs, and part of the ice stored during November
will be sold in December, therefore, requiring a total storage
capacity of 18,750 tons, of which 750 tons will be stored in the
ante-room and 18,000 tons will be stored in the big winter storage.

NOTE--These sales can only be realized if the dealer has at least
18,000 tons of natural ice on hand to enable him to take care of the
family trade during the hot months.

If no large supply of natural ice is on hand hardly 50,000 tons can be
sold, thereby increasing the cost per ton considerably.


POWER COST:

Due to numerous starting and stopping of compressor during the slack
months the maximeter charges will be higher and therefore it must be
assumed that 60 K. W. hours will be required per ton of ice instead of
55 K. W. hours for continuous consumption.

60 K. W. hours per ton of ice at .9 cent per K. W. hour equals 54
cents per ton. Adding 1/2 cent per ton for the required heating the
power cost for making 60,450 tons of ice equals 60,450 x 54.5 cents,
equals  $ 32,945.25

333 days continuous full output.

12,000-ton storage house.


COST OF POWER:

A modern, highly efficient and economical steam driven high speed
compressor plant must be installed so as to get the maximum power out
of coal. The boiler room will contain two 250-H. P. water-tube boilers
with automatic stokers and coal bin overhead holding two weeks' supply
of coal. Steam pressure 175 lbs. As the firing of the boilers is
automatic and requires practically no work on the part of the
engineers, no firemen are needed. Ashes will also be removed
automatically. The engine room equipment will consist of two 175-ton
high speed compressors, direct connected to two Simple Condensing
Una-flow Engines; also two generators, two cooling tower water pumps,
two air compressors, switchboard, etc. All to be equipped with the
latest labor and power-saving devices.

Equipped as above, 25 tons of refrigeration can be easily obtained
from one ton of ordinary 12,500 B T U coal. 1.8 ton of refrigeration
is required to produce one ton of ice including the required cooling
of storage house.

Therefore the power cost of making one ton of ice with coal at $5.00
per ton equals $5.00 divided by  25/1.8 = 37 cent. (One cent per ton
of ice is added for heating of dipping tank water.)

Assuming one month's shut-down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 160 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 53,280 tons of ice.

The total power cost of making 53,280 tons of ice is therefore,
53,280 x 37 cent = $ 19,713.60

COST OF POWER:

A modern, highly efficient and economical steam driven high speed
compressor plant must be installed so as to get the maximum power out
of coal. The boiler-room will contain two 200-H. P. water-tube boilers
with automatic stokers and coal bin overhead holding two weeks' supply
of coal. Steam pressure 175 lbs. As the firing of the boilers is
automatic and requires practically no work on the part of the
engineers, no firemen will be needed. Ashes will also be automatically
removed. The engine room equipment will consist of two 100-ton high
speed compressors, direct connected to two Simple Condensing Unaflow
Engines; also two generators, two cooling tower pumps, two air
compressors, switchboard, etc. All to be equipped with the latest
labor and power-saving devices.

Equipped as above, 25 tons of refrigeration can be easily obtained
from one ton of ordinary 12500 B T U coal. 1.8 tons of refrigeration
is required to produce one ton of ice, including the cooling of the
storage house.

Therefore, the power cost of making one ton of ice with coal at $5.00
per ton equals $5.00 divided by 25/1.8 = 37 cent. (One cent per ton of
ice is added for heating of dipping-tank water.)

Assuming one month's shut down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 100 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 33,300 tons of ice.

The total power cost of making 33,300 tons of ice is therefore,
33,300 x 37 cent, equals  $ 12,321.00


[13]


ENGINE ROOM AND ICE PLANT LABOR COST:

1 Chief Engineer per day      $ 8.00

3 Engineers per day           $ 6.00

2 Storage House Men per day   $ 4.00

Total per day                $ 34.00

Total 365 days at $34.00 per day         $ 12,410.00

Additional labor cost for putting
  7,500 tons into winter storage
  and taking out at $4.00 per day           $ 750.00

Total labor cost                         $ 13,160.00

or 13160 / 33300 = 39.52 cent per ton


Engineer will do his own firing of boilers and will pull all the ice
and set it up in ante room if required. One pull required every 70
minutes.

Chief Engineer will act as shipping clerk.


OFFICE EXPENSE:

1 Office Man (Manager and Bookkeeper)     $ 3,000.00

Stationery, Telephone, etc. (per year)      $ 300.00

Total Office Expense                                  $ 3,300.00

or 3300  / 33300 = 9.9 cent per ton


Cost of Ammonia at   2 cent per ton                     $ 666.00

Cost of Oil and Waste at   2 cent per ton               $ 666.00

Cost of Water at   3 cent per ton                       $ 999.00

Cost of Salt at   1/2 cent per ton                      $ 166.50

Plant Maintenance and Repairs                         $ 1,500.00

or 1500 / 33300 = 4.5 cent per ton

[Transcriber's Note]

I found this document and the attached papers and photographs among my
father's papers. I offer it as an insight into the finances and
structure of business and trades in the early 1900's.

There are no dates included in this document but a Google search of
"Otto Luhr" produced these items:

  Mechanical and Refrigerating Engineer's Handy Book; Otto Luhr; 1913.

  Automatic refrigerating liquid feeder and regulator;
  United States Patent 1725875; 8/27/1929.

  Refrigerator car; United States Patent 1642882; 9/20/1927.

Since the title page states "Patent Applied For", this document was
probably published around 1925.

Note the prices quoted for materials and labor:
Coal, $5.00 a ton.  [In 2009, about $100/ton, down from $300 in 2008.]
Unskilled Labor, $6.00/day; that's DAY, not HOUR.
Skilled Labor, $8 to $10/day
Electricity, $0.009/KWH  [my latest bill (in 2009) was $0.1317/KWH]

Note the job titles in the attached documents: Barnmen, Washers,
Blacksmiths

The word "MAINTAINANCE" is thus spelled in the original.

Finally, the optimistic tone of the document contrasts with the
decline of the ice business in the 1940's, fifteen years later. I
remember the ice deliveries and the weight sign my mother put in the
window before we got our first mechanical refrigerator after
World War II.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
