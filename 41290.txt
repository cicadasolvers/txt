INTRODUCTION


The two pieces here reproduced have long been unavailable; their
connections with Arbuthnot are rather complex. _The Story of the St.
Alb-ns Ghost_ has been ambiguously associated with Arbuthnot since the
year of its first publication, but it does not seem to have been
reprinted since the nineteenth century when editors regularly included
it among the minor works of Swift. Whoever wrote it, the _Story_ is a
lively and effective Tory squib, whose narrative vigor can carry even
the twentieth-century reader over the occasional topical obscurities. _A
Catalogue of the ... Library of ... Dr. Arbuthnot_ has never been
reprinted at all, and appears to be unknown by scholars who have thus
far written about Arbuthnot.


_The Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost_, the first piece included, has
always been of doubtful authorship, and must for the present so
continue. Two days after the _Story_ first appeared, Swift tantalizingly
wrote to Stella: "I went to Ld Mashams to night, & Lady Masham made me
read to her a pretty 2 penny Pamphlet calld the St Albans Ghost. I
thought I had writt it my self; so did they, but I did not" (22 February
1712). Whoever wrote it, the _Story_ succeeded: it was pirated within a
week, and had reached its third regular "edition" within three weeks of
the first; it appeared in a fifth and apparently final edition on 19
July 1712.[1] Now just during these same months Arbuthnot was producing
his first political satires, five pamphlets later gathered under the
title _History of John Bull_. He published the first of these 4 March
1712 and the last 31 July 1712.[2] There are several thematic and
methodological connections between _The Story of The St. Alb-ns Ghost_
and the John Bull pamphlets: as Tory propaganda pieces, they attack
leading Whigs and make the usual suggestions about irreligion, moral
turpitude and misuse of public funds. Furthermore, they do so by means
of vigorous if sometimes difficult reductive allegories which mock the
victims by presenting them as farcical figures from low life. The
connection as well as the difficulties must have appeared quite early,
for some enterprising publisher (presumably Curll)[3] soon brought out
_A Complete Key to the Three Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the
Story of the St. Alban's Ghost_. Although the exact date of this is not
known, it must lie between the _termini_ 17 April and 9 May 1712, the
dates of the third and fourth parts respectively of John Bull.
Furthermore, a "Second Edition Corrected" of the Key appeared before the
publication of pamphlet four. (The last pages of these two Keys,
concerning the _Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost_, are reproduced in the
Appendix.) The Key ran through two further editions as _A Complete Key
to the Four Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the Story of the St.
Alban's Ghost_, presumably before 31 July 1712, and came to a fifth
(seemingly last) edition with a more general title referring to "all
Parts" of John Bull, and still including the _Story_.

While the Keys by association suggest Arbuthnot as author, the only
other contemporary document attributes the _Story_ to a different
physician and wit: the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr. William
Wagstaffe_ (London, 1726) reprint the fourth edition of the Story. Now
the _Miscellaneous Works_ were printed some five months after the death
of Dr. Wagstaffe and more than three months after that of the supposed
editor Dr. Levett;[4] it is possible that the contents are in part
erroneous. In any case, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and Swift remain the
possible authors with whom scholars must deal until some further
evidence is forthcoming. Roscoe interprets Swift's ambiguous remarks in
the _Journal to Stella_ as an indirect acknowledgement, and Dilke goes
one step further in assuming that the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of
Dr. Wagstaffe_ are a mystification, a means for Swift to pass off works
which he did not wish to include in the _Miscellanies_ with Pope. Sir
Walter Scott thinks that the _Story_ is probably a collaboration between
Arbuthnot and Swift, "judging from the style"; Professor Herbert Davis
dissociates Wagstaffe material generally from the writings of Swift, but
does not specifically mention the _Story_; however, "Mr. Granger thought
St. Alban's Ghost, attributed to Dr. Wagstaffe, was [Arbuthnot's]."[5]

Although recent scholars seem to agree in selecting Wagstaffe as author
of the _Story_, the evidence of the 1726 _Works_ is implicitly
contradicted by the Keys. I have made two separate attempts to solve the
question of authorship, neither of which has been fully satisfactory.
The first of these, a computerized test based on the methods of
Professor Louis T. Milic for distinguishing works by Swift from works by
other authors, has given inconclusive results. In this test the _Story_
was the chief unknown, and was compared with samples of similar length
from Swift, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and, as a control, Mrs. Manley, who
wrote politically keyed narratives but has never been associated with
the _Story_. The _Story_ turned out to be fairly similar to all four
authors in the number of different three-word patterns (D), and unlike
all of them in number of Introductory Connectives (IC), where Wagstaffe
stood the highest, and the _Story_ by far the lowest. In the proportion
of Verbals (VB) the _Story_ and Wagstaffe were fairly close together and
different from the other authors tested, who clustered near the Swift
figures. Thus the test tends to exclude Swift, Arbuthnot and Mrs. Manley
as possible authors, but does not encourage a full confidence in
replacing them with Wagstaffe. (It also tends to show that some of the
other pieces included in the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr.
Wagstaffe_ differ considerably in the usages tested both from one
another and from the patterns established by the signed works of Dr.
Walstaffe.)[6]

My second attempt was based on textual changes among editions of the
_Story_. In the second edition there are three small changes from the
first; the third and fourth editions seem to be line-for-line reprints
of the second. (The "sham, Imperfect Sort" introduces a large number of
variants, mainly errors.) In the fifth edition, however, somebody has
altered the typography: many past forms of verbs are altered. Thus at
the bottom of p. 3 _unbody'd_ becomes _unbodyed_, _carry'd_ and
_deliver'd_ become _carryed_, _delivered_. The task of editing is not
complete; particularly near the end of the fifth edition many verbs
still carry the apostrophe of the earlier editions. The date of the
attempt suggests that Swift's _Proposal for Correcting, Improving and
Ascertaining the English Tongue_ (first published 17 May 1712, a week
after the fourth edition of the _Story_) could have provided the
motivation, and also that Swift himself could not have been the person
who made the changes. A study of a few contemporaries shows that Swift
himself tried to eliminate the apostrophes from the _Conduct of the
Allies_, first published 27 November 1711, and from other works
published after that date, but not from works published before that
date. Oldisworth, apparently under the instructions of Swift, tried to
do the same during the first few months of the _Examiner_, vol. 2
(beginning 6 December 1711), but by the time he reached volume 3,
Oldisworth had apparently given up the struggle against unwilling
printers. Arbuthnot, Roper and Manley are not very interested in the
matter, and neither are other pamphleteers published by Morphew during
the months immediately following Swift's _Proposal_. The items included
in the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr. Wagstaffe_, on the other
hand, fall into three groups chronologically: those which precede
Swift's _Proposal_, and include many apostrophied verb forms; those
which immediately follow Swift's _Proposal_, and include abnormally few
apostrophied verb forms; the two "late" pieces (1715, 1719), which are
back to the proportion of apostrophied verbs to be found in the early
items. If Pseudo-Wagstaffe was indeed a single writer, then he followed
the same pattern as Oldisworth, but began later and continued longer to
use verbs with an _-ed_ ending. Since the genuine signed prose works of
Dr. Wagstaffe come "late" (1717, 1721) and have a fairly large (i.e.,
normal) number of apostrophied verbs, there is no evidence here as to
whether or not Pseudo-Wagstaffe is Wagstaffe; at least there is no
contradiction. In the light of these facts, we can see that neither
Swift nor Arbuthnot is a probable author of the _Story_; Swift would
presumably have altered verb typography in the first and all editions,
and Arbuthnot would not have altered it at all.[7] In these two projects
on authorship we find that authors other than Wagstaffe tend to be
eliminated, but that Wagstaffe himself is not strongly confirmed. The
authorship remains as problematic as before, and the _Story_ may as well
for this century continue with the Arbuthnotiana, as it did during the
nineteenth with the Swiftiana.


The device of using a ghost story as vehicle for political satire was by
1712 a well-established one. Elias F. Mengel Jr. refers to "the 'ghost'
convention, so popular in the Restoration,"[8] and an important poem of
Queen Anne's reign shows some similarities with and perhaps provided a
model for the _Story_. In _Moderation Display'd_ (London, 1705) the
recently deceased second Earl of Sunderland rises from Hell to confound
his guilty Whig companions. Tonson (Bibliopolo) is the most terrified,
and as in the _Story_ Wharton (Clodio) is so wicked that he is not
frightened at all. The _Story_, however, is both more subtle and more
flexible than most other satiric "ghost" narratives. It compresses the
actual apparition into the last quarter of the narrative, despite the
perhaps deliberately misleading title. Nearly half of the _Story_ deals
with previous events; much of the rest is machinery, introduction of
seemingly irrelevant details with a mischievous verisimilitude which
actually advances the main satiric aims. The opening paragraph, for
example, first denounces Roman Catholic superstition, a denunciation
which almost every Englishman could join, and then turns the fire toward
"Our Sectarists." The war on heterodoxy continues in the references to
Dr. Garth, the Whig poet and physician noted for his scepticism in
religion, to William Whiston who during the winter of 1711-1712 was
transcribing documents and writing elaborate treatises to uphold his
view that Christian churches and theologians had all been essentially
heretical since the time of Athanasius, and to the Reverend and
Honourable Lumley Lloyd, a low-church minister whose sermons attracted
at least two Tory satires.[9] None of these men belongs in the
narrative, and only Garth was even remotely connected with the
Marlboroughs, but all of them were Whigs, and in various ways serve to
"demonstrate" that Whigs must be false brethren to the Church of
England.

This charge, although a cliche of Tory satires, is here made indirect
and witty, as are the staple charges against the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough. Whereas, however, the wickedness of nonconformity had been
attacked for decades, the Duke of Marlborough had been associated with
the Whigs for a relatively short time. As late as 1706 Wagstaffe could
generously declare that "_Woodstock's_ too little" a reward (_Ramelies,
a Poem_), but since Swift's "Bill of British Ingratitude" in the
_Examiner_ (17 November 1710) the Tory press had begun to say that the
rewards were too many and too great. The _Story_ repeats the charge that
Avaro and Haggite "grew Richer than their Mistress" (p. 11), together
with the ridiculous insinuations of cowardice and incompetence found
constantly reiterated in the second volume of _Examiners_. The Duchess
of Marlborough attracted massive satire earlier than her husband, in
such books as _The Secret History of Queen Zarah_ (London, 1705),[10]
and her habit of saying "Lawrd" with an affected drawl is mentioned in
_The Secret History of Arlus and Odolphus_ (n.p., 1710), pp. 21, 22, 23.

Although not so frequent as attacks on the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough, attacks on Mrs. Jennings the mother of the Duchess had
already been made, and indeed the _Story_ relies for part of its effect
on the fact that Mrs. Jennings is already associated with witchcraft. In
_Memoirs of Europe_ (London, 1710)[10] for example, she inherits a
familiar spirit from Sir Kenelm Digby, there reported the real father of
the Duchess (II, 44-46). In _Oliver's Pocket Looking-Glass_ (n.p., 1711)
Mrs. Jennings appears as "the famous Mother Shipton, who by the Power
and Influence of her Magick Art, had plac'd a Daughter in the same
Station at Court [i.e., Maid of Honour] with _Meretricia_ [Arabella
Churchill] ..." (p. 21). Because the author of the Story assumes that
previous Tory allegations are well-known, he is free to perform elegant
variations or to allude indirectly. Assuming the fact of witchcraft
allows him to heap up an ambiguous burlesque of popular superstition
which is in part entertainment and in part rebuttal of recent Whig
sneers at Tory credulity during the Jane Wenham witch trial.[11] Here as
throughout the pamphlet, the author demonstrates the virtuosity which
even Swift commends. Since Swift praises few pamphlets except those
written by himself and Arbuthnot (or occasionally Mrs. Manley), the
_Story_ enters a fairly select company. It is the only Pseudo-Wagstaffe
piece mentioned by name in the _Journal to Stella_, the only one found
worthy to stand beside the productions of Swift and Arbuthnot.[12]


The second document reproduced claims to be _A Catalogue of the Capital
and Well-Known Library of Books, of the Late Celebrated Dr. Arbuthnot_.
To the extent that the claim is true, the _Catalogue_ will be important
for studies of the Scriblerian Club generally, since Arbuthnot is the
member with the greatest reputation for learning. Although the contents
of a man's library do not correspond exactly with the contents of his
mind, scholars can discover a good deal about the intellectual methods
of Dr. Arbuthnot by examining the books which he owned. Until now this
has not been possible; the _Catalogue_ is a recent acquisition of the
British Museum, not so much as mentioned in books thus far published
about Arbuthnot. For several reasons, however, the document must be used
with caution. First of all, the compilers list a total of 2525 volumes,
but they itemize only 1639,[13] and even then often give inadequate
information. Furthermore, a xerox copy of the Sale Book records of the
auction, very kindly sent to me by the present Messrs. Christie, Manson
and Woods, shows that almost a quarter of the lots (items 53-65,
243-245, 276-372, 426), or 999 volumes, belonged not to the Arbuthnot
estate but to other owners. Finally, Dr. Arbuthnot died in 1735, whereas
the auction was not held until December 1779, about three and a half
months after the death of his bachelor son George. Of the books
belonging to the Arbuthnot estate, almost 20% were printed after 1735,
and belonged not to the father but to the son, or perhaps in some cases
to the daughter Anne, who lived with her brother.[14] The legal books
are likely all to have been George Arbuthnot's, and presumably some of
the other books printed before 1735 also. Despite these obscurities, the
Catalogue throws a good deal of new light upon the most learned
Scriblerian--and upon his family.

Dr. Arbuthnot seems to have bought relatively few antiquarian books;
about 20% of the itemized volumes belonging to his estate come before
1691, the year when he first went to London. In selecting these older
works Arbuthnot has shown a catholic taste and linguistic ability: he
bought grammars and dictionaries, besides works on medicine and science,
literature, history and religion, written in English, French, Italian,
Latin and Greek, plus a solitary Hebrew Bible (item 234); his copy of
Udall's _Key to the Holy Tongue_ is dated 1693 (item 183). Less than a
quarter of these earlier books are in English. The sole "cradle" date of
the catalogue, 1495 for _Rosa Anglica_ (item 417), may be a misprint:
editions of 1492 and 1595, among others, have been previously recorded,
but none for 1495.[15]

When compared with the antiquarian books, the list of titles from the
Arbuthnot estate either dated or first published after the death of Dr.
Arbuthnot reveals a number of differences. English is the predominant
language of the late group, with French a poor second. There is another
Hebrew Bible (253), a Spanish Cervantes (25), an Italian Machiavelli
(96), but no Greek book at all, and astonishingly only two Latin: a
dictionary (89) and a Horace (147); Cicero appears in a French
translation (26). In part, of course, the shift in languages accompanies
the general decline of humanistic learning in the eighteenth century,
but it also strengthens our knowledge of Dr. Arbuthnot's erudition.
Although apparently not interested in science, George Arbuthnot read
widely, however, in other areas (see for example 10, 15, 49, 158, 160,
168, 170, 254, 271). Similarly, the books from outside the Arbuthnot
estate are less learned than those of Arbuthnot. They do include two
Greek testaments (290, 310) and some recent scientific works (e.g. 314,
*349), but lack the great Greek writers whom Arbuthnot collected, such
as Plato (125), Aristotle (126), Herodotus (385) or Aristophanes (387).
Whereas Arbuthnot read Newton's treatises (81, 85, 197, 217), one of the
other owners read Algarotti's simplification (*312).

The subjects of the books in the Arbuthnot estate can be variously
divided. By sheer number of titles, literature is the most important
subject, closely followed by science (including medicine as the biggest
sub-group), and then by history. In number of volumes, however, the
historical section is considerably larger than the literary, and science
comes third. Books on geography and travel, philosophical treatises,
grammars and dictionaries, even a work on astrology (109), attest to the
breadth of Arbuthnot's interests. A few works in the fine arts are
listed, somewhat surprisingly only two of them on music (32, 373). The
military item (391) may come from the Doctor's brother George, who was
in the army, or it may represent another aspect of the general interest
in all human affairs. There is a fairly large number of religious works,
including books by Eusebius and Sozomen (127), Spotswood (380), Huet
(383), Charles Leslie (251), Leibniz (141), Tillotson (395) and Jeremy
Taylor (3,394). The elaborately bound Greek Septuagint (272) and Greek
New Testament (273) must be the ones which Arbuthnot specified in his
will (the only books there mentioned), calling them "the Gift of my late
Royal Mistress Queen Anne."[16] As the _Catalogue_ does not describe
any other fine bindings, the other books seem to have been bought for
use rather than for show.

A study of the duplications among the books in the Arbuthnot estate
reinforces the opinion that the books were bought for use. The only
items appearing three times are the works of Pope (76, 180) and Pope's
_Iliad_ (11, 77, 242). Since two of the former were published after the
death of Arbuthnot, and must have belonged to the Arbuthnot children,
perhaps the extra _Iliads_ were equally the property of Arbuthnot's
heirs. The duplicates of Moliere (21, 135), Prideaux (50, 379), and
Veneroni (90, *229) could also have belonged to the children. However,
the bulk of the duplications seem to involve obtaining a later edition
or a necessary text, and thus to have a scholarly rationale. For
example, the two editions of Eustachius are dated 1714, 1728 (115, 259),
those of Livy are dated 1578, 1708 (7, 386), while both sets of
Sennertus seem to be broken (406, 407).

Not surprisingly, Arbuthnot owned a number of satirical works. In
addition to Pope and Moliere, already mentioned, he owned Petronius (9),
Juvenal and Persius (230), Terence (231), Plautus (232), Boileau (98),
Gay (79) and Swift's _Tale of a Tub_ (178). He presumably bought or was
given other works by Swift, but no others are itemized; perhaps some
were in the "Large parcel of pamphlets" (1). George Arbuthnot added a
copy of _The Four Last Years of Queen Anne_ (173), not published until
1758.

Although literature bulks large among Arbuthnot's books, English poetry
is not very conspicuous. According to some of the dates, Arbuthnot may
have developed his interest in English poetry rather late in life.
Although he owned a 1611 Spenser (423), he did not buy the listed
Chaucer (110) until 1721. Pope may have inspired the urge to acquire
Milton (80, 185), but there seems to be no literary reason for wanting a
Milton in French (184). Some other member of the family was, however,
sufficiently interested in Milton to buy Newton's edition in 1749 (78).
The minor poets listed are also late in date (72, 187). The only Dryden
is the translation of Virgil (16), which could represent an interest in
classical just as much as in English poetry. There are, however, two
copies of Prior's _Poems_ in the large paper edition (106, 252). As the
compilers of the _Catalogue_ have left many volumes unspecified, there
must have been other poetic works, but the listed sample is rather
small.

Characteristically uninterested in his personal fame, Arbuthnot kept no
copies of his own writings except the reissued _Tables of Ancient Coins_
(84, 193), associated with a favorite son. The reader revealed by this
library is the same Arbuthnot whom his contemporaries admired: witty,
yet thoughtful and religious; deeply learned, yet modest. His children,
although less learned than the father, continued to buy books on current
topics, particularly literature, history and travel. Aged over seventy,
George Arbuthnot was still ingesting such materials as Laughton's
_History of Ancient Egypt_ (168) and Raynal's comprehensive history of
colonialism (10). Despite the obscurity of the word "more" under which
the compilers listed half of the total volumes, even the sample of the
library is a welcome addition to our knowledge about Dr. Arbuthnot.

(Amsterdam, 1925), pp. 6-7, are drawn from dates in the Examiner, a
weekly newspaper. Three of these dates are correct, and the other two
are close, but can be corrected by consulting papers published more
often. The first pamphlet seems to have appeared on 4 March 1712 (see
_Post-Boy_ of that date), and the third may have appeared on 16 April
1712 (see the _Daily Courant_ of 16 and 17 April; the _Post-Boy_,
however, agrees with the _Examiner_ on the date 17 April).

THE STORY OF THE ST. ALB-NS GHOST.


I can scarcely say whether we ought to attribute the Multitude of Ghosts
and Apparitions, which were so common in the Days of our Forefathers, to
the Ignorance of the People, or the Impositions of the Priest. The
Romish Clergy found it undoubtedly for their Interest to deceive them,
and the Superstition of the People laid themselves open to receive
whatsoever They thought proper to inculcate. Hence it is, that their
Traditions are little else, than the Miracles and Atchievements of
unbody'd Heroes, a Sort of spiritual Romance, so artfully carry'd on,
and delivered in so probable a Manner, as may easily pass for Truth on
those of an uncultivated Capacity, or a credulous Disposition. Our
Sectarists indeed still retain the Credulity, as well as some of the
Tenets of that Church; and Apparitions, and such like, are still the
Bug-bears made use of by some of the most Celebrated of their
Holders-forth to terrify the old Women of their Congregation, (who are
their surest Customers) and enlarge their Quarterly Subscriptions. I
know one of these Ambidexters, who never fails of Ten or Twenty Pounds
more than Ordinary, by nicking _something Wonderful_ in due Time; he
often cloaths his whole Family _by the Apparition of a Person lately
executed at_ Tyburn; or, _a Whale seen at_ Greenwich, _or thereabouts_;
and I am credibly inform'd, that his Wife has made a Visit with a Brand
new Sable Tippet on, since the Death of the _Tower Lions_.

But as these Things will pass upon none but the Ignorant or
Superstitious, so there are others that will believe nothing of this
Nature, even upon the clearest Evidence. There are, it must be own'd,
but very few of these Accounts to be depended on; some however are so
palpable, and testify'd by so good Authority, by those of such undoubted
Credit, and so discerning a Curiosity, that there is no Room to doubt of
their Veracity, and which none but a Sceptic can disbelieve. Such is the
following Story of Mother _Haggy_ of St. _Alb----ns_, in the Reign of
King _James_ the First, the mighty Pranks she plaid in her Life-time,
and her Apparition afterwards, made such a Noise, both at Home and
Abroad, and were so terrible to the Neighbourhood, that the Country
People, to this Day, cannot hear the Mention of her Name, without the
most dismal Apprehensions. The Injuries they receiv'd from the Sorceries
and Incantations of the Mother, and the Injustice and Oppression of the
Son and Daughter, have made so deep an Impression upon their Minds, and
begot such an Hereditary Aversion to their Memory, that they never speak
of them, without the bitterest Curses and Imprecations.

I have made it my Business, being at St. _Alb----ns_ lately, to enquire
more particularly into this Matter, and the Helps I have receiv'd from
the _most noted Men of Erudition in this City, have been Considerable_,
and to whom I make my publick Acknowledgment. The Charges I have been at
in _getting Manuscripts_, and Labour in _collating them_, the
Reconciling the Disputes about the most _material Circumstances_, and
adjusting the _various Readings_, as they have took me up a considerable
Time, so I hope they may be done to the Satisfaction of my Reader. I
wish I could have had Time to have distinguish'd by an Asterism the
Circumstances deliver'd by Tradition only, from those of the
Manuscripts, which I was advis'd to do by my worthy Friend the Reverend
Mr. _Wh----n_, who, had he not been _Employ'd otherways_, might have
been a very proper Person to have undertaken such a Performance.

The best Manuscripts are now in the Hands of the Ingenious Dr.
_G----th_, where they are left for the Curious to peruse, and where any
_Clergyman_ may be welcome; for however he may have been abus'd by
those who deny him to be the Author of the _D----y_, and tax'd by others
with Principles and Practices unbecoming a Man of his Sense and Probity,
yet I will be bold to say in his Defence, that I believe he is as good a
Christian, as he is a Poet, and if he publishes any Thing on the late
D----d _M----y_, I don't question but it will be interspers'd with as
many Precepts of Reveal'd Religion, as the Subject is capable of
bearing: And it is very probable, those _Refin'd Pieces_ that the Doctor
has been pleas'd to own, since the Writing of the _D----y_, have been
look'd upon, by the lewd debauch'd Criticks of the Town, to be dull and
insipid, for no other Reason, but because they are grave and sober; but
this I leave for others to determine, and can say for his Sincerity,
that I am assur'd he believes the following Relation as much as any of
us all.

Mother _Haggy_ was marry'd to a plain home-spun Yeoman of St.
_Alb----ns_, and liv'd in good Repute for some Years: The Place of her
Birth is disputed by some of the most celebrated Moderns, tho' they have
a Tradition in the Country, that she was never Born at all, and which is
most probable. At the Birth of her Daughter _Haggite_, something
happen'd very remarkable, and which gave Occasion to the Neighbourhood
to mistrust she had a Correspondence with _Old Nick_, as was confirm'd
afterwards, beyond the Possibility of Disproof. The Neighbours were got
together a Merry-making, as they term it, in the Country, when the old
Woman's High-crown'd Hat, that had been thrown upon the Bed's Tester
during the Heat of the Engagement, leap'd with a wonderful Agility into
the Cradle, and being catch'd at by the Nurse, was metamorphos'd into a
Coronet, which according to her Description, was not much unlike that of
a _German_ Prince; but it soon broke into a thousand Pieces. _Such_,
cries old Mother _Haggy, will be the Fortune of my Daughter, and such
her Fall_. The Company took but little Notice what she said, being
surpris'd at the Circumstance of the Hat. _But this is Fact_, says the
Reverend and Honourable L----y _L----d_, _and my Grandmother, who was a
Person of Condition, told me_, says He, _she knew the Man, who knew the
Woman, who was_, said she, _in the Room at that Instant_. The very same
Night, I saw a Comet, neither have I any Occasion to tell a Lye as to
this Particular, _says my Author_, brandishing its Tail in a very
surprising Manner in the Air, but upon the Breaking of a Cloud, I could
discern, _continues he_, a Clergyman at the Head of a Body of his own
Cloth, and follow'd by an innumerable Train of Laity, who coming towards
the Comet, it disappear'd.

This was the first Time Mother _Haggy_ became suspected, and it was the
Opinion of the Wisest of the Parish, that they should Petition the King
to send her to be try'd for a Witch by the _Presbytery of Scotland_. How
this past off I cannot tell, but certain it is, that some of the Great
Ones of the Town were in with her, and 'tis said she was Serviceable to
them in their Amours: She had a Wash that would make the Skin of a
Blackamore as white as Alabaster, and another, that would restore the
Loss of a Maidenhead, _without any Hindrance of Business, or the
Knowledge of any one about them_. She try'd this Experiment so often
upon her Daughter _Haggite_, that more than Twenty were satisfy'd they
had her Virginity before Marriage.

She soon got such a Reputation all about the Country, that there was not
a Cow, a Smock, or a silver Spoon lost, but they came to her to enquire
after it; All the young People flock'd to have their Fortunes told,
which, they say she never miss'd. She told _Haggite_'s Husband, he
should grow Rich, and be a Great Man, but by his Covetousness and
Griping of the Poor, should come to an ill End. All which happen'd so
exactly, _That there are several old Folks in our Town, who can remember
it, as if it was but Yesterday_.

She has been often seen to ride full gallop upon a Broom-Stick at
Noon-Day, and swim over a River in a Kettle-Drum. Sometimes she wou'd
appear in the Shape of a Lioness, and at other times of a Hen, or a Cat;
but I have heard, could not turn herself into a Male Creature, or walk
over two Straws across. There were never known so many great Winds as
about that Time, or so much Mischief done by them: The Pigs gruntled,
and the Screech-Owls hooted oftner than usual; a Horse was found dead
one Morning with Hay in his Mouth; and a large overgrown Jack was caught
in a Fish-Pond thereabouts with a silver Tobacco-Box in his Belly;
several Women were brought to Bed of two Children, Some miscarry'd, and
old Folks died very frequently.

These Things could not chuse but breed a great Combustion in the Town,
as they call it, and every Body certainly had rejoyc'd at her Death,
had she not been succeeded by a Son and Daughter, who, tho' they were no
Conjurers, were altogether as terrible to the Neighbourhood. She had two
Daughters, one of which was marry'd to a Man who went beyond Sea; the
other, her Daughter _Haggite_, to _Avaro_, whom we shall have Occasion
to mention in the Sequel of this Story.

There liv'd at that Time in the Neighbourhood two Brothers, of a great
Family, Persons of a vast Estate and Character, and extreamly kind to
their Servants and Dependants. _Haggite_ by her Mother's Interest, was
got into this Family, and _Avaro_, who was afterwards her Husband, was
the Huntsman's Boy. He was a Lad of a fine Complexion, good Features,
and agreeable to the fair Sex, but wanted the Capacity of some of his
fellow Servants: Tho' he got a Reputation afterwards for a Man of
Courage, but upon no other Grounds, than by setting the Country Fellows
to Cudgelling or Boxing, and being a Spectator of a broken Head and a
bloody Nose.

There are several authentic Accounts of the Behaviour of these Two, in
their respective Stations, and by what Means they made an Advancement of
their Fortunes. There are several Relations, I say, now extant, that
tell us, how one of these great Brothers took _Avaro_'s Sister for his
Mistress, which was the Foundation of his Preferment, and how _Haggite_,
by granting her Favours to any one who would go to the Expence of them,
became extreamly Wealthy, and how Both had gain'd the Art of getting
Money out of every Body they had to do with, and by the most
dishonourable Methods. Never perhaps, was any Couple so match'd in
every Thing as these, or so fit for one another: A Couple so link'd by
the Bonds of Iniquity, as well as Marriage, that it is impossible to
tell which had the greatest Crimes to answer for.

It will be needless to relate the Fortune of the Brothers, who were
their Successive Masters, and the Favours they bestow'd on them. It is
sufficient that the Estate came at last to a Daughter of the younger
Brother, a Lady, who was the Admiration of the Age she liv'd in, and the
Darling of the whole Country, and who had been attended from her Infancy
by _Haggite_.

Then it was _Avaro_ began his Tyranny; he was entrusted with all the
Affairs of Consequence, and there was nothing done without his
Knowledge. He marry'd his Daughters to some of the most considerable
Estates in the Neighbourhood, and was related by Marriage to one
_Baconface_, a sort of Bailiff to his Lady. He, and _Baconface_ and
_Haggite_ got into Possession, as it were, of their Lady's Estate, and
carry'd it with so high a Hand, were so haughty to the Rich, and
oppressive to the Poor, that they quickly began to make themselves
odious; but for their better Security, they form'd a sort of Confederacy
with one _Dammyblood_, _Clumzy_ their Son-in-Law, _Splitcause_ an
Attorney, and _Mouse_ a noted Ballad-Maker, and some others. As soon as
they had done this, they began so to domineer, that there was no Living
for those who would not compliment, or comply with them in their
Villany. _Haggite_ cry'd, _Lord, Madam_, to her Mistress, _It must be
so_; _Avaro_ swore, _By_ G----d, and _Baconface_ shook his Head, and
look'd dismally. They made every Tenant pay a Tax, and every Servant
considerably out of his Wages toward the Mounding their Lady's Estate,
as they pretended, but most part of it went into their own Pockets. Once
upon a Time, the Tenants grumbling at their Proceedings, _Clumzy_, the
Son-in-Law, brought in a Parcel of Beggars to settle upon the Estate.
Thus they liv'd for some Years, till they grew Richer than their
Mistress, and were, perhaps, the Richest Servants in the World: Nay,
what is the most Remarkable, and will scarcely find Belief in future
Ages, they began at last to deny her Title to the Estate, and affirm,
she held it only by their Permission and Connivance.

Things were come to this pass, when one of the Tenants Sons from
_Oxf----rd_ preach'd up Obedience to their Lady, and the Necessity of
their Downfall, who oppos'd it. This open'd the Eyes of all the honest
Tenants, but enrag'd _Avaro_ and his Party, to that Degree, that they
had hir'd a Pack of Manag'd Bull-Dogs, with a Design to bait him, and
had done it infallibly, had not the Gentry interpos'd, and the Country
People run into his Assistance. These, with much ado, muzled the Dogs,
and petition'd their Lady to discard the Mismanagers, who consented to
it.

Great were the Endeavours, and great the Struggles of the Faction, for
so they were call'd, to keep themselves in Power, as the Histories of
those Times mention. They stirr'd up all their Ladies Acquaintance to
speak to her in their behalf, wrote Letters to and fro, swore and
curs'd, laugh'd and cry'd, told the most abominable and inconsistent
Lyes, but all to no Purpose: They spent their Money, lavish'd away their
Beef, Pudding, and _October_, most unmercifully, and made several
_Jointed-Babies_ to shew for Sights, and please the Tenants Sons about
_Christmas_.

Old _Drybones_ was then the Parson of the Parish, a Man of the most
notorious Character, who would change his Principles at any Time to
serve a Turn, preach or pray _Extempore_, talk Nonsense, or any Thing
else, for the Advancement of _Avaro_ and his Faction. He was look'd upon
to be the greatest Artist in _Legerdemain_ in that Country; and had a
Way of shewing the Pope and little Master in a Box, but the Figures were
so very small, it was impossible for any Body but himself to discern
them. He was hir'd, as is suppos'd, to tax the New Servants with Popery,
together with their Mistress, which he preach'd in several Churches
thereabouts; but his Character was too well known to make any Thing
credited that came from him.

There are several Particulars related, both by Tradition and the
Manuscripts, concerning the turning out of these Servants, which
would require greater Volumes than I design. It is enough, that
notwithstanding their Endeavours, they were Discarded, and the Lady
chose her new Servants out of the most honest and substantial of her
Tenants, of undoubted Abilities, who were tied to her by Inclination as
well as Duty. These began a Reformation of all the Abuses committed by
_Avaro_ and _Baconface_, which discover'd such a Scene of Roguery to
the World, that one would hardly think the most mercenary Favourites
could be guilty of.

_Avaro_ now began to be very uneasie, and to be affrighted at his own
Conscience; he found nothing would pacifie the enrag'd Tenants, and that
his Life wou'd be but a sufficient Recompence for his Crimes. His Money
which he rely'd on, and which he lavish'd away to Bribe off his
Destruction, had not Force enough to Protect him: He could not, as it is
reported, Sit still in one Place for two Minutes, never Slept at all,
Eat little or nothing, Talk'd very rambling and inconsistent, of
_Merit_, _Hardships_, _Accounts_, _Perquisites_, _Commissioners_,
_Bread_ and _Bread-Waggons_, but was never heard to mention any
_Cheese_.

He came and made a Confession in his own House to some People he never
saw before in his Life, and which shews no little Disorder in his Brain;
_That, whatever they might think of him, he was as Dutiful a Servant as
any his Mistress had_. _Haggite_ rav'd almost as bad as he, and had got
St. _Anthony's Fire_ in her Face; but it is a question, says Dr.
_G--th_, whether there was any Thing Ominous in that, since it is
probable, the Distemper only chang'd it's Situation.

Mean while, it was agreed by _Baconface_ and others, that a Consultation
should be call'd at _Avaro_'s House, something Decisive resolv'd on, in
order to prevent their Ruin; and accordingly _Jacobo_ the Messenger was
sent to inform the Cabal of it.

Dismal and horrid was the Night of that infernal Consultation, nothing
heard but the melancholly Murmuring of Winds, and the Croaking of Toads
and Ravens; Every thing seem'd Wild and Desert, and double Darkness
overspread the Hemisphere: Thunder and Lightning, Storms and Tempest,
and Earthquakes, seem'd to Presage something more then Ordinary, and
added to the Confusion of that Memorable Night. Nature sicken'd, and
groan'd, as it were, under the Tortures of universal Ruine. Not a
Servant in the House but had Dreamt the strangest Dreams, and _Haggite_
her self had seen a Stranger in the Candle. The Fire languish'd and
burnt Blue, and the Crickets sung continually about the Oven: How far
the Story is true concerning the Warming-Pan and Dishes, I cannot say,
but certain it is, a Noise was heard like that of rolling Pease from the
top of the House to the bottom; and the Windows creak'd, and the Doors
rattled in a manner not a little terrible. Several of their Servants
made Affidavit, That _Haggite_ lost a red Petticoat, a Ruff, and a Pair
of Green-Stockings, that were her Mother's, but the Night before, and a
Diamond-Cross once gave her by a _Great Man_.

'Twas about Midnight before this Black Society got together, and no
sooner were they seated, when _Avaro_ open'd to them in this manner. We
have try'd, _says he_, my Friends, all the Artifices we cou'd invent or
execute, but all in vain. Our Mistress has discover'd plainly our
Intentions, and the Tenants will be neither flatter'd, nor frighted, nor
brib'd into our Interest. It remains therefore, and what tho' we Perish
in the Attempt, we must Perish otherwise, that once for all we make a
Push at the very Life of----When, Lo! _says the Manuscript_, An unusual
Noise interrupted his Discourse, and _Jacobo_ cry'd out, _The Devil, the
Devil at the Door_. Scarce had he Time to speak, or they to listen, when
the Apparition of Mother _Haggy_ entred; But, Who can describe the
Astonishment they were then in? _Haggite_ sounded away in the
Elbow-Chair as she sat, and _Avaro_, notwithstanding his boasted
Courage, slunk under the Table in an Instant: _Baconface_ screw'd
himself into a thousand Postures; and _Clumzy_ trembled till his very
Water trickled from him. _Splitcause_ tumbled over a Joint-Stool, and
_Mouse_ the Ballad-Maker broke a Brandy-Bottle that had been _Haggite_'s
Companion for some Years: But _Dammyblood, Dammyblood_ only was the Man
that had the Courage to cry out G-d D-m your Bl--d, What occasion
for all this Bustle? Is it not the Devil, and is he not our old
Acquaintance? This reviv'd them in some Measure; but the Ghastlyness of
the Spectacle made still some Impression on them. There was an
unaccountable Irregularity in her Dress, a Wanness in her Complexion,
and a Disproportion in her Features. Flames of Fire issued from her
Nostrils, and a sulphurous Smoak from her Mouth, which together with the
Condition some of the Company were in, made a very noisome and offensive
Smell; and _I have been told_, says a very Grave Alderman of _St.
Albans, Some of them saw her Cloven Foot_.

I Come, _says she_, at length, (in an hollow Voice, more terrible than
the celebrated Stentor, or the brawny _Caledonian_) I Come, O ye
Accomplices in Iniquity, to tell you of your Crimes, to bid you desist
from these Cabals, for they are Fruitless, and prepare for Punishment
that is Certain. I have, as long as I could, assisted you in your
Glorious Execrable Attempts, but Time is now no more; the Time is coming
when you must be deliver'd up to Justice. As to you, O Son and Daughter,
_said she_, turning to them, 'tis but a few revolving Moons, e'er you
must both fall a Sacrifice to your Avarice and Ambition, as I have told
you heretofore, but your Mistress will be too Merciful, and tho' your
ready Money must be refunded, your Estate in Land will Descend onto your
Heirs. But you, O _Baconface_, you have Merited nothing to save either
your Life or your Estate, be contented therefore with the Loss of both:
And _Clumzy, says she_, you must have the same Fate, your Insolence to
your Lady, and the Beggars you brought in upon the Tenants will require
it. _Dammyblood, continues she_, turning towards him, you must expect a
considerable Fine; but _Splitcause_ and _Mouse_ may come off more
easily. She said, gave a Shriek; and disappear'd; and the Cabal
dispers'd with the utmost Consternation.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
