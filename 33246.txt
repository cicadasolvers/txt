Soups

A Sweet Disposition.

    Three grains of common sense, one large heart, one good liver,
    plenty of fresh air and sunlight, one bushel contentment, one good
    husband. Do not bring to a boil.


GERMAN SOUP.--Good, fresh beef and some cracked bone are all important
for soup making. The stock when nutritious, and properly prepared,
forms the basis of meat soups. To make the stock great care must be
taken in boiling the meat. Put your meat on in cold water, enough to
cover the meat, set on the stove to boil, for four hours, slowly but
steadily; never boil very fast. When meat becomes tender, add salt,
skim carefully, repeat until no more skum arises. Now if more water is
needed, always add boiling water from tea kettle. In adding vegetables,
prepare such as one prefers, pick over and wash them, chop them, take
out the meat, strain the stock through either a fine strainer or a
cloth, return to kettle, drop in the vegetables, boil until tender. Add
also the meat after the bone is taken out; cut it up in medium sized
pieces. The vegetables give the meat a nice flavor. I use cabbage,
carrots, onions, tomatoes, peas, parsley, celery and potatoes. Now for
other soups the stock is prepared the same way. Noodle soup may be made
and rice soup; the rice to be parboiled; then there are the egg
dumplings, or barley, vermicelli, and many other kinds of ways to have
a change. Celery or parsley should always be used as it flavors the
stock very fine for any kind of soup.

POTATO SOUP.--Now this soup is made of left over meat and the bones of
roasts, put them on in cold water and boil slowly; you may also add a
little fresh meat; then dice some potatoes, strain the stock and return
to the stove, put in the potatoes and some rice, boil until tender,
then heat a little grease and fry onions until glazed, add a little
flour, brown with onions in grease, then pour the soup into this hot
mixture, and let it come to a boil. That is fine.--Mrs. George
Bruegger. (Demonstration of German Cookery No. 2.)

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP.--Take two celery roots, cut up fine and slowly
cook one hour in a pint of water; flavor with a little piece of onion;
strain through fine sieve. Mix one tablespoon of butter and two of
flour, add one quart of milk and boil twenty minutes. Add a little salt
and pepper. Serve with one cup of whipped cream added the last
minute.--Mrs. R. J. Walker.

GREEN PEA SOUP.--One pint or one can green peas, one quart boiling
water, one pint milk, two tablespoons butter, one teaspoon salt,
one-eighth teaspoon pepper, one half teaspoon sugar, two tablespoons
flour. Cook peas in water, scald milk. When peas are soft mash through
a strainer, add milk and reheat. Rub flour and butter together, stir
into them a little of the soup and turn this mixture into the rest of
the soup. Stir till smooth, season. Serve with croutons. To make
croutons, cut buttered slices of bread one-half inch thick into
one-half inch squares, heat these on a pan in the oven, stirring
occasionally. They may be kept and reheated.--Dorothy Whitehead.
Demonstrated in 7th grade Domestic Science lesson.

ONION AND POTATO SOUP.--One and one-half quarts milk (steamed), two
large potatoes and two onions chopped real fine, season with butter,
pepper and salt. Cook in a stew pan until done. When ready to serve
pour together.--Mrs. John Heffernan.

CREAM TOMATO SOUP.--One can of tomatoes put through a sieve, season
with butter, pepper and salt; thicken with two tablespoons flour,
bringing to a boil. Steam one and a half quarts milk in double cooker,
just before serving, pour together, stirring with a spoon.--Mrs. John
Heffernan.

SOUP STOCK.--Two soup bones, one of mutton and one of beef, (cracked to
get the good of them), one onion chopped fine together with two
tablespoons sugar, brown in kettle, stirring to keep from burning. Add
meat bones, turning them over a few times. Pour in four quarts cold
water, add one carrot, chopped fine, and bay leaves. Boil slowly three
hours, strain and season to taste. Any vegetable may be added to
this.--Mrs. John Heffernan.

MOCK OYSTER SOUP.--To one can tomatoes add two quarts milk, tablespoon
butter, salt and pepper. (Steam milk in double cooker.) Stew tomatoes
in sauce pan, season, and when ready to serve pour together.--Mrs. John
Heffernan.

CHICKEN GUMBO SOUP.--Fry a chicken, remove bones and chop chicken fine.
Put in a kettle with two quarts boiling water, three large ears of corn
cut from cob, six tomatoes sliced, twenty-four pods of okra cut up. Fry
the corn, tomatoes and okra brown in the chicken drippings first, then
add to the water and chicken with two tablespoons rice, pepper and
teaspoon salt. Simmer one hour.--Mrs. Whitehead. Southern Cookery
demonstration.

MULLAGATAWNAY SOUP.--Cut four onions, one carrot, two turnips and one
head of celery into three quarts of liquor in which one or two fowls
have been boiled; keep it over a brisk fire till it boils, then place
it on a corner of the fire and let it simmer twenty minutes. Add one
tablespoon of currie powder and one tablespoonful of flour; mix the
whole well together and let it boil three minutes; pass it through a
colander. Serve with pieces of roast chicken in it. Add boiled rice in
a separate dish. It must be of good yellow color and not too thick.
Half veal and half chicken will answer.--Mrs. Whitehead.

BOUQUET OF SWEET HERBS.--Two sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves, two
sprigs of thyme, two of summer savory and two of sage. Tie the dried
herbs with the parsley. Nice for seasoning soups and stews.--Contributed.

BOILED POTATO DUMPLINGS.--Grate several potatoes, add salt to taste, a
little nutmeg, one egg and some bread crumbs browned in butter, a
little flour and milk, add enough flour and milk so as to handle and
make in balls. Drop into boiling salt water. When done brown some bread
crumbs in butter and put over dumplings when on platter.--Mrs. Paul
Leonhardy.

DUMPLINGS.--Two cups of flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one-half
teaspoon salt, one cup sweet milk. Stir and drop from a spoon into
chicken broth or boiling meat. Let boil fifteen minutes with cover off
and put cover on and boil five minutes.--Mrs. A. McKay.

NOODLES.--Four eggs well beaten, one tablespoon water, 2 cups flour,
one-half teaspoon salt. Work and knead together and roll out in very
thin sheets; let them dry; roll up like jelly roll and cut into very
fine strips; then drop into boiling salted water and boil ten minutes;
or they may be boiled in soup and served with it. If wanted as a
separate dish drain them in a colander and turn them into a dish. Fry
bread crumbs in butter a light brown and turn them over the noodles and
serve. These noodles can be fried in grease instead by cutting the
sheets into strips two inches wide and four inches long, and dropping
them into hot grease. Lift out and dredge with sugar. Both very
nice.--Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.

OYSTER SOUP.--Heat one quart of milk with two large tablespoonfuls of
butter. Heat a solid pint of oysters in enough water to cover them. Add
one large teaspoonful of salt and a good deal of pepper. As soon as the
oysters get plump and the gills "ruffle" add them to the hot milk. Stir
in a cupful of crushed cracker crumbs and serve in soup plates or
bowls, with oyster crackers.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

RAISED DUMPLINGS.--Soak a cake of compressed yeast in a cup of lukewarm
milk, together with a tablespoonful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt.
Sift a pint of flour into a bowl and stir into it a cupful of milk, an
egg and the soaked yeast and work all thoroughly, adding gradually
flour for a soft dough. Do not get it stiff. Cover the bowl and let the
dough rise until it has doubled the original bulk. Flour the
kneading-board and mold the dough into small biscuits. Let these rise
for half an hour. Butter a large, round pan and set your dumplings
within it, brushing each with melted butter on top. Pour in enough milk
to reach halfway to the top of the dumplings. Set upon a brick in the
oven and bake to a light brown. Eat with vanilla sauce or prunes.

NO. TWO.--Proceed as with No. 1, but instead of baking in the oven, put
the dumplings into a steamer, not too close together. Allow for
swelling. Cover with a close lid to keep in the steam. These may also
be served with vanilla or with prune sauce.

NO. THREE.--Have ready a large kettle of boiling water, slightly
salted, and after shaping the dumplings drop them carefully into this.
Leave plenty of room to swell and puff. Or they may be steamed in clear
soup. If you like you may try all of these recipes and still have
enough dough left for a pan of biscuits.




Fish, Oysters and Shell Fish

    "He was a brave man who first ate an oyster."--Dean Swift.


FISH.--With the possible exception of salmon, fish is a less nutritious
article of diet than flesh meat, and yet it fitly supplements the
latter. The oily and coarser grained species is more nutritious than
the white, or finer grained but not so easily digested. A fish is in
good condition when its gills are bright clear red, its eyes full and
the body firm and stiff. Before cooking they should be well washed in
cold water and kept in salt water for a short time, but they should not
be allowed to stand in water for any length of time and should be kept
upon ice until wanted. Small fish are usually fried or boiled, all
large fish to be boiled should be wrapped in a cloth and tied closely
with twine, steaming is preferable to boiling. Salmon, bluefish,
halibut and shad are very palatable baked in cream. Mackerel is best
broiled and should be broiled upon the skin side first; other fish
first on the inside. In boiling fish, let simmer gently as hard boiling
breaks them; time, eight minutes to a pound, sometimes longer.

BAKED FISH.--Clean and wipe dry a white fish or any good sized fish,
stuffing made like that for poultry, but drier. Sew it up and put in a
hot pan with drippings and a lump of butter; dredge with flour and lay
over the fish a few thin slices of salt pork or bits of butter. Bake
half hour, basting occasionally.

BOILED FISH.--All fresh fish, except salmon should be placed in salted
cold water for boiling. If placed in boiling water the outside would
cook much sooner than the inside. A little vinegar added to the water
in which fish is boiled improves the flavor. Put the fish in the kettle
with the back bone down, to three or four pounds of fish put a small
handful of salt. Boil the fish gently until you can draw out one of the
fins easily. Most varieties of fish will be well done in twenty or
thirty minutes, some in less time. Serve with drawn butter, with hard
boiled eggs sliced, or if preferred, milk sauce.

BAKED WHITE FISH WITH TOMATOES.--Take a white fish or trout that will
weigh about three pounds, clean, rub with salt and pepper inside and
out. Lay a piece of salt pork, not too fat, in the flesh, put in a
covered baking dish and turn over it one pint of stewed seasoned
tomatoes, cold tomatoes left over are nice. Bake about forty minutes.

SCALLOPED SALMON.--Place in a baking dish a layer of cracker crumbs,
then a layer of salmon, then another layer of cracker and salmon,
ending with a layer of cracker. On this pour two cups of milk, one egg
whipped. Add salt, pepper and butter size of an egg. Bake.

SALMON CUTLETS.--One cup of hot mashed potatoes and one cup of salmon,
mash together and form into cakes, put in a beaten egg, roll in bread
crumbs or crackers and fry in hot lard.

FRIED FISH.--Wash the fish thoroughly, wipe dry, sprinkle lightly with
salt, dip in beaten egg then roll in cornmeal, fry in hot fat.
Note--Above fish recipes were demonstrated in American Cookery series
by Mrs. A. McKay.

FISH CROQUETTES.--Two small or one large white fish; boil, bone and
chop; add a little salt, red pepper and onions; make gravy of the water
the fish is boiled in; add milk, butter and flour; stir in fish, shape
into croquette, roll in egg, cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard.
Garnish with parsley.

TARTARE DRESSING FOR FISH CROQUETTES.--Take yolk of one raw egg; beat;
add a little salt, red pepper, mustard and mix well. Beat in salad oil
until thick; let stand on ice until needed. Then add juice of two
lemons or half cup of vinegar, one tablespoon of capers, six small
cucumber pickles chopped fine and very little onion. Serve cold with
hot croquettes.--Mrs. Whitehead.

OYSTER COCKTAIL.--Half pint of catsup, twenty-five drops tabasco sauce,
one tablespoonful horseradish, one teaspoonful dry mustard, one
teaspoonful lemon juice, oysters, pepper and salt to taste. Put four or
five oysters in glass and pour one tablespoon of this sauce over them.
Fill glass with finely chipped ice, serve at once.--Mrs. Davidson.

OYSTER COCKTAIL.--A small oyster is used, five or six being alloted
each person. For six persons mix together three teaspoons each of
vinegar, grated horseradish and tomato sauce; six teaspoons of lemon
juice and one of Worcestershire sauce. Have the oysters very cold. Put
an equal amount of the prepared sauce over the oysters in each glass.
The glass should be placed upon a plate. Serve with an oyster fork and
small spoon. This is the prevailing way of serving oysters as a first
course.--Mrs. R. J. Walker.

OYSTERS a la BECHEMEL.--Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter and blend
it with two tablespoonfuls of flour, add one large cupful of thin cream
or milk and cook thick. Plump a scant pint of oysters in their own
liquor. Season with one teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, juice
of half a lemon and one-half teaspoon of onion juice squeezed from an
onion. Add oysters to the cream sauce and cook two minutes. Serve in
pattie shells or on toast.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SALMON LOAF.--One pound can salmon, four well beaten eggs, one cup fine
cracker crumbs, one tablespoon melted butter, half teaspoon salt.
Remove bones from salmon and mince finely. Mix all together with hands,
form into loaf and steam one hour. Serve with following sauce: Take
liquid from salmon and add two tablespoons sweet milk, little salt, one
tablespoon corn starch, boil all together and pour over loaf.--Mrs.
Schollander.

SCALLOPED SALMON.--Place in a baking dish a layer of bread crumbs then
a layer of salmon, another crumbs and salmon, ending with crumbs. On
this pour two cups of milk, one egg (whipped), salt, pepper and butter
the size of an egg.--Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.

OYSTER FRITTERS.--Beat yolks of two eggs light, add one half cup milk
and one cup of flour sifted with one fourth teaspoon of salt. Beat well
and add one half teaspoon of melted butter. Set aside for an hour or so
in a cool place. When ready to use beat the whites of eggs stiff and
add them. Take a large oyster in a big spoon, dip it into the batter
and filling the spoon and drop into smoking hot grease or fry like
doughnuts. Serve with tomato catsup or any preferred sauce.

OYSTER SAUTE.--Drain select oysters, heat pan hot and brown butter in
it. Just cover the bottom of the pan with large oysters as soon as the
butter sizzles and is piping hot. When brown on under side turn and
brown well. Season with salt and pepper. Add butter as needed and turn
the oysters and butter sauce on to prepared toast points. Heat the dry
pan again, add butter and when hot brown more oysters in it. The butter
must be hot and only a few oysters should be browned at a time.

OYSTERS AND BACON BAKED.--Butter a roast pan and lay large plump
oysters in a layer on the bottom of it. Season to suit taste with salt,
pepper and lemon juice and lay three thin slices of bacon over the top.
Roast brown in a quick oven. Serve on toast with tomato sauce, if
liked, or with cream sauce. A piquant bake is made by mixing finely
chopped green apples with the oysters before baking.

PIGS IN BLANKETS.--Wrap each large oyster in a thin strip of bacon and
fasten with a tooth pick, bake in a quick oven until bacon is crisp and
oysters plump. Sometimes they are broiled over clear coals.

CREOLE OYSTERS.--Bake in ramekins or individual dishes. Put a teaspoon
of butter in the bottom of each dish, then six or seven oysters; add
one tablespoon of chili sauce and place a strip of bacon on top of
each. Place dishes in a baking pan and bake until bacon is crisp.

SAUCE FOR OYSTER COCKTAILS.--Mix three tablespoons of tomato catsup,
three tablespoons of vinegar, one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce,
three tablespoons of grated horseradish, juice of one lemon and salt
and pepper to season well. Place on ice. Chill the oysters well, wash
and drain them, lay six in each serving glass and cover with the
prepared sauce. Serve very cold, with salted wafers.--Contributed.

OYSTERS IN CELERY SAUCE.--Clean and cut celery into small pieces and
cook until tender in boiling salted water. Rub enough of the soft
celery through a colander to make a cupful. In a saucepan melt a
tablespoonful of butter and mix smoothly into it a heaping
tablespoonful of flour. Add a cupful of hot milk and cook until creamy;
add the soft celery and half a pint of oysters, add more salt if
needed, one-eighth teaspoon of pepper and a few drops of lemon juice;
cook until the oysters curl, when the filling is ready for the
ramekins. Serve hot.

DEVILED OYSTERS.--Butter scallop shells and put into each five oysters
with their own liquor and sprinkle with a drop of Tobasco, a little
tomato catsup and a quarter-salt-spoonful of salt and cover with fine
cracker or bread crumbs. Scatter a few bits of butter here and there on
the oysters and set the shells in a hot oven. Serve on doily covered
plates.

KIPPERED HERRING.--Rinse herring in warm water, dry and put on tin or
agate plate in hot oven 15 minutes; then pour over a little melted
butter, cover and leave in 5 minutes more. This should be served on
small pieces of toast.

FINNAN HADDIE.--Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut in pan and
when hot add two cupfuls of finnan haddie picked fine. Add one cupful
of cream or milk into which one tablespoonful of flour has been rubbed
smooth. Let come to a boil and when cooled a little add a dash of
pepper and the well beaten yolk of an egg. Serve on toast.

SCALLOPED OYSTERS.--Roll one pound and a half of crisp crackers fine.
Butter a deep baking dish and spread a layer of crackers an inch deep.
Spread over them a dozen oysters in their liquor, sprinkle a generous
half teaspoon salt and a dash of pepper over them, dot with bits of
butter, (about two tablespoons) and pour in half a cupful of milk, then
add another layer cracker crumbs, oysters, etc., and proceed until one
quart of oysters and one and one half pounds of crackers are used.
Cover the top with cracker crumbs, dot generously with butter and pour
on the remaining milk and oyster liquor. Use altogether about one and
one half pints of milk to this quantity of oysters and crackers. Bake
about one hour or until crumbs are well browned and oysters
plump.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SAUCE FOR OYSTER PATTIES.--One cupful of solid oysters. Melt two large
tablespoons of butter in a stew pan, blend in two heaping tablespoons
of flour and rub smooth; add one scant pint of cream or rich milk; stir
until smooth and thick. Drain the oysters and add them with one level
teaspoon of salt and a good dash of pepper. When the oysters are plump
remove to back of range and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs mixed
with a little cream. For canned oysters add one large teaspoon of curry
powder before serving. Serve in pattie shells of baked pastry or in
timbal cases or on buttered toast.--Mrs. Whitehead.

OYSTER PIE.--Line a baking dish with rich pastry, either pie crust or
biscuit crust. Put one quart of oysters in a double boiler with one cup
of milk, and two thirds cup of butter and steam until oysters are plump.
Slice six hard boiled eggs, mix with one half cupful of cracker crumbs
and a cupful of sweet cream; add one full teaspoon of salt and a
generous sprinkling of pepper. Mix with the prepared oysters and fill
the lined baking dish. Cover with the top crust and bake about twenty
minutes in a hot oven or the pastry shell may be baked separately if
preferred and filled with the cream. The thickened, creamed oyster patty
filling makes a good filling for oyster pie, also it may be served with
steamed dumplings or small baking powder biscuits.--Contributed.

FRIED OYSTERS.--Select large, fresh oysters. Drain them and season with
salt and pepper. Roll bread crumbs that have been crisped in the oven
very fine and then sift them. Dip each oyster in the prepared crumbs
and then into beaten egg and again into the crumbs. Heap the crumbs in
thick little piles and roll the oysters in them until a nice thick
crust is formed over each oyster. Have an iron kettle or skillet filled
two inches deep with smoking hot lard, lay the oysters in a nice frying
basket, if you have one, and plunge it into the hot grease. Cook until
nicely browned. Drain and serve hot with lemon points, tomato catsup or
any preferred sauce.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SALMON TIMBALES.--One can salmon, flaked, add the beaten yolks of three
eggs, two tablespoons of thick cream, one teaspoon of lemon juice, salt
and pepper and lastly cut in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs.
Pour into greased individual molds, set in a pan of hot water and bake
about twenty minutes.

BAKED FISH SCALLOPS.--Two cups cold cooked fish. Remove the bones and
break fish into small flakes. Mix with a thick cream sauce, well
seasoned. Butter baking shells or individual dishes, fill with the
creamed fish, cover with fine bread or cracker crumbs, dot with butter
and bake until brown. Serve with lemon points.

CODFISH BALLS.--One cup of flaked cod fish soaked in clear water, then
drained. Boil three large potatoes until tender, then drain and mash
with the cod fish. Season with salt, pepper and butter and add one
beaten egg. Drop by the spoonful into smoking hot grease and fry like
doughnuts. Serve immediately.

SCALLOPED FISH.--Add flaked cold cooked white fish, halibut or salmon
to a thick cream sauce seasoned with minced onions, thyme or parsley
and butter, alternate with layers of cracker crumbs and bake brown.

CREAMED FISH CANAPES.--Beat an egg with half a cup of milk and add a
dash of salt. Dip circles of bread, cut half an inch thick, in this and
fry brown in butter, turning once. Spread with creamed fish or chicken
and place a poached egg on top. Dot with butter and sprinkle with salt
and pepper and serve for breakfast or lunch.

WILD DUCK ROASTED.--Prepare as for roasting the same as any fowl,
parboil for fifteen minutes with an onion in the water to remove the
strong flavor. A carrot will answer the same purpose. Stuff with bread
crumbs, a minced onion, season with pepper and salt, a little sage and
a good supply of butter, roast until tender. Use butter plentifully in
basting. One half hour will suffice for young ducks. If bread crumb
dressing is not liked, sliced apple stuffed in the duck is very
nice.--Mrs. A. McKay.

TO PREPARE VENISON.--Wash clean, dry well with clean dry cloth, salt,
pepper and dredge with flour, cut long gashes into roast, place in
gashes strips of salt pork or bacon; lay strips on top; place in a bake
pan with a very little water, cover roast until nearly done, take off
cover, baste and brown slightly.--Mrs. A. McKay.

BROILED PRAIRIE CHICKEN.--After dressing lay on ice for a few hours,
then divide in halves, again divide the thick sections of the breast,
sprinkle with salt and pepper and lay the pieces on a gridiron the
inside down. Broil slowly at first. Serve with cream gravy and currant
jelly.

PRAIRIE CHICKEN (STEAMED AND BAKED).--Stuff them with a dressing of
bread crumbs and seasoning of pepper and salt, mixed with melted
butter, sage, onion or summer savory may be added if liked. Secure the
fowl firmly with a needle and twine. Steam until tender, then remove to
dripping pan; dredge with flour, pepper and salt, and brown delicately
in oven. Baste with melted butter. Garnish with parsley and currant
jelly. Above game recipes given in American Cookery demonstration by
Mrs. A. McKay.

BROILED VENISON STEAK.--Venison steaks should be broiled over a clear
fire, turning often. It requires more cooking than beef. When
sufficiently done season with salt and pepper, pour over two
tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, melted with a piece of butter. Serve
hot on hot plates. Delicious steaks, corresponding to the shape of
mutton chops are cut from the loin.--Mrs. C. C. Mackenroth.

ROAST VENISON.--Rub the saddle or haunch of venison with a damp cloth
and then rub in butter. Make a thick paste of flour and water and
spread it an inch thick on the roast. Lay a buttered coarse wrapping
paper or one of the new cooking paper bags over the roast and put the
meat in the roasting pan with one cupful of hot water. Lift the paper
and baste every fifteen minutes with melted butter and hot water. Roast
in a hot oven until the meat is tender, then remove the paper and the
coat of paste. Dredge the meat with flour, one teaspoonful of salt and
pepper and baste with pan drippings and butter until meat is nicely
browned. Add a pint of hot water to the drippings and thicken with
flour for a gravy. Add a pinch of cloves, nutmeg and mace and stir in a
glass of currant jelly until it is dissolved. Strain and serve with the
meat. Venison cooked this way will be moist instead of dry and
hard.--Mrs. Whitehead.

ROAST PRAIRIE CHICKEN.--Have chicken skinned and put in cold water at
least three hours, then wipe dry and stuff with bread crumb dressing.
Put in roaster and dot with bits of butter and two or three slices of
bacon, one onion pricked with three cloves, add several pepper and all
spice kernels and a teaspoonful of salt and one cupful of water. Roast
about one and one half hours and baste occasionally.--Mrs. J. Bruegger.

ROAST WILD DUCK.--It is best to keep wild ducks a few days after they
are killed if the weather is cold. As most wild duck have the flavor of
fish, therefore it is advisable to parboil them, with a carrot in each
duck, before roasting, as this absorbs all the unpleasant taste. An
onion has the same effect, but when onion is used in dressing the
carrot is preferable. Roast the same as tame duck and use dressing for
stuffing fowl with a little onion added; bake about one half hour in
very hot oven, carefully turning them, baste them and add a little
water if necessary. A few slices of bacon roasted with it adds to the
flavor of wild game. Serve hot with the gravy it yields. The canvas
back duck requires no spices or flavors to make it perfect, as the meat
partakes of the flavor of the food the birds feed upon, which is wild
celery, and this delicious flavor is best preserved when roasted
quickly with a hot fire.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

PRAIRIE CHICKEN OR SQUAB PIE.--After the chickens are picked and drawn
as a large fowl is for roasting, wash them and put them in a saucepan
with a close cover; they should be covered with boiling water and
boiled slowly till tender, when a little salt and an onion and cloves
should be added; then take them out, drain and dry, and put in each
squab a teaspoonful of butter, a little pepper, salt, minced parsley
and thyme; then put into the cavity of each chicken a hard boiled egg;
lay them in a large baking dish three or four inches deep; strain over
them the liquor in which they were simmered, add teaspoonful of butter,
one teacup of milk or cream; sift in two tablespoonfuls of cracker
crumbs, put in a few slips of parsley, cover with a rich crust and
bake.--Contributed.




Poultry

    "Take the goods the Gods provide thee."--Dryden.


ROAST TURKEY.--Select if possible a young turkey, carefully remove all
feathers and singe it over a burning paper on the stove, then see that
it is carefully drawn and no internals broken; remove the crop
carefully; after the head is cut off, tie the neck close to the body,
by drawing the skin over it, now wash the inside of the turkey in
several clean waters, into the next to the last add a teaspoonful of
baking soda, this is to destroy that sour taste which fowls often have,
if not freshly killed. After a thorough rinsing and washing of the bird
wipe dry both in and outside with a clean cloth, rub the inside with
salt, then stuff the body and breast with dressing for stuffing fowls,
then sew up with strong thread, rub it over with a little soft butter,
sprinkle over some salt and pepper, dredge with a little flour, place
in a roaster with a little water and cook from two to two and a half
hours, turn it around occasionally so that every part will be browned
alike, when it appears done, pierce with a fork and when the liquid
runs clear, the bird is done. Serve with cranberry sauce. Garnish with
parsley, or fried oysters.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

DRESSING FOR STUFFING FOWL.--For an eight or ten pound turkey use about
three pints of stale bread crumbs, put into a dish and pour tepid water
over it, (not hot for that makes it heavy) let stand for a few minutes,
then take up a handful and squeeze dry with both hands, put into
another dish and when all is pressed dry toss it up lightly through
your fingers, this process makes it very light. Parboil the liver,
heart, and gizzard, in a little stew pan. When tender mince very fine
and add to the bread, now one teaspoon of salt, a little pepper, half
cup of melted butter; peel and chop one cooking apple, two tablespoons
of green or dry fine minced parsley; mix well, add one beaten egg, mix
again and it is ready for either turkey or chicken. For goose or duck
add a few slices of onion chopped fine. The water in which the heart,
gizzard and liver were stewed may be used with the gravy of the roast
turkey, goose, duck or chicken.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

ROAST GOOSE.--The goose should not be more than eight months old, and
the fatter the more tender and juicy the meat. After the goose has been
well washed, cleaned and wiped, rub a little salt inside, stuff with
the dressing for stuffing fowls with a little onion added to the
dressing. Do not stuff too full and stitch the openings firmly to keep
the flavor in and the fat out. Place in roaster with a little water and
bake about two and a half hours, carefully turning it frequently and
baste with water and salt. When done with all parts evenly brown, take
up, pour off the fat and to the brown gravy left, add a little water,
and some flour to thicken, bring to a boil and serve in a gravy boat.
Garnish goose with parsley.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

VIRGINIA FRIED CHICKEN.--Dress and cut up chickens, rub each piece with
salt and pepper, then dip it into beaten egg, then into flour and fry
brown in deep hot fat or butter and lard mixed, or bacon drippings.
Cover the skillet and let chicken cook slowly after it is browned well
to be sure it is done. Remove chicken to platter and turn out part of
the drippings. Add cooking spoon of flour to remaining drippings and
cook a minute, then add milk or cream to make gravy. Season with salt
and pepper and just before serving add beaten yolk of one egg mixed
with a little milk. Serve with chicken. Garnish chicken platter with
slices of cold boiled ham or crisp bacon, and corn dodgers and you will
have a typical "Old Dominion" dish. I got above recipe from a Virginia
woman.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SMOTHERED CHICKEN.--Split a young chicken down back, season with salt
and pepper and put in roaster with one cup hot water. Roast (covered)
until tender. As it begins to brown make a paste of two tablespoons
each of butter and flour, blended, and spread it over chicken, basting
often with pan dipper. Add cupful cream to drippings in pan for gravy.
If the chicken is large cut into pieces as for frying before roasting
this way.--Mrs. Whitehead.

CREOLE STEWED CHICKEN.--Boil a pint of rice in two quarts of water
until half done, then add a cut up fowl with one minced onion, blade of
mace, four large mushrooms or half a can, half a chili pepper, teaspoon
salt and three or four small tomatoes cut up and one tablespoon butter.
Stew gently until chicken is tender, stirring often and adding hot
water as needed. Serve in baked pastry shell or on toast. Mrs.
Whitehead. Above chicken recipes were demonstrated in Mrs. Whitehead's
paper on Southern Cookery.

SWEDISH DUCK FILLING.--One quart of bread crumbs, four good-sized
apples, one half cup of browned butter, cinnamon, raisins, and currants
to taste. Stuff fowl.--Contributed.

DAIRY LUNCH CHICKEN SANDWICH.--Make a thin batter of one and one half
pints of water, one pint of milk, one egg, scant half teaspoon of soda,
one tablespoon of salt, dash of pepper and flour enough to mix like pan
cake batter. Cut a young chicken into quarters, dip it in the batter
and fry brown in deep fat. Serve between slices of bread. Garnish with
dill pickles.--Mrs. T. A. McKay.

CHICKEN CROQUETTES.--One cup of the white meat of boiled fowl packed in
solid, then chopped fine and mashed till like fine powder. Add one half
level teaspoon salt, one half saltspoon paprika, or white pepper. Make
one pint thick cream sauce, with two level tablespoons butter and two
heaped tablespoons of cornstarch cooked together, diluted with one pint
of hot cream, and stirred till very smooth and thick. Season with one
half teaspoon salt and one half saltspoon pepper. Stir as much of the
hot sauce into the chicken as it will take up and enable you to handle
the mixture in shaping, remembering that the sauce will be much thicker
when cold, and so the mixture may be quite soft. The meat varies greatly
in its power to absorb the sauce, therefore it is impossible to give an
exact amount but if the sauce is thick a large portion may be used and
the croquettes will be all the more creamy for it. When cold, shape a
tablespoon of the mixture into a ball, then into a cylinder, roll in
fine dry bread crumbs, beaten egg diluted with water, then crumbs again,
and fry one minute in deep, smoking hot fat. More of the delicious
flavor of the meat will be retained with this simple seasoning of salt
and pepper than with a variety of condiments.--Contributed.

CREAMED STEWED CHICKEN.--Cut up fowl as for fricassee, put over the
fire in enough cold water to cover it well. Bring gradually to a boil.
When it begins to bubble, add a stalk of celery, some chopped parsley,
and a bay leaf. Simmer until tender before seasoning. Make a white
sauce in a frying pan of two tablespoons butter cooked with the same
quantity of flour. As soon as well mixed stir into this a large cupful
of strained and skimmed gravy from the pot, have ready one half cup
cream, heated with a pinch of soda, add this to the thickened gravy,
very slowly so as not to curdle. Do not boil after cream is in. Cook
dumplings in the gravy left, after the reserved cupful and chicken are
taken out.

DUMPLINGS FOR CHICKEN STEW.--In a pint of flour, sift a heaping
teaspoon baking powder, one fourth teaspoon salt, sift flour twice, now
rub in a tablespoonful of shortening, and wet with enough milk to make
a dough that can be rolled out. Cut into rounds and drop into the
boiling gravy. Should be done in ten minutes.--Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.

CREAMED CHICKEN.--Three pounds of chicken boiled tender in salted water
and freed of bones, skin and gristle. Cut the meat into small pieces.
Boil two sweet breads tender in salted water with the juice of half a
lemon. When tender, drain and throw them into cold water to blanch;
then free from skin and gristle and cut into small pieces; drain a can
of French mushrooms and cut them into quarters. Make a cream sauce of
two tablespoons of butter, melted and blended with two tablespoons of
flour, add one pint of hot thin cream, one teaspoon of salt, juice of
one lemon, and juice pressed from half a small onion, and a dash of
pepper, cook thick but remove from fire and add one beaten egg yolk
mixed with one cup of whipped cream. Add to the heated chicken,
mushrooms and sweet breads. Mix well and serve in patty shells, or
timbales. (The whipped cream may be omitted.) For escalloped chicken
turn the above mixture into a buttered baking dish, cover with fine
rolled bread crumbs, dot with butter and bake until well browned.
Reserve the chicken broth for soup or make a gravy of it and serve with
baking powder biscuit or dumplings.--Contributed.

CROQUETTES.--Cook one large tablespoon of butter with two tablespoons
of flour, add one cup milk or cream, one teaspoon onion juice, one
teaspoon salt, dash of pepper and nutmeg and one beaten egg. Mix with
one cup of minced meat or chicken, form into croquettes after the
mixture has stood an hour. Fry brown in deep fat after rolling in egg
and bread crumbs.--Contributed.

HOT TAMALES.--Cook a three pound chicken tender in salted water to
cover. Chop chicken meat fine and return bones to the kettle. Cut open
six large chilli peppers or chillies, wash, cut out seeds and cut into
halves. Cover with boiling water and cook until soft and press through a
fine sieve. Brown a golden color two medium sized chopped onions in hot
butter, add the chilli pulps with half a cup of chicken broth, cover pan
and cook slowly fifteen minutes. Put one quart of corn meal into a bowl
and pour over it enough hot chicken broth to make a dry paste; work with
the hands into a soft but not wet paste. Have broad six inch long corn
husks soaked until pliable in warm water. Open these and down the center
of each put a wide strip of corn meal paste; mix the chopped chicken
with the chilli mixture and spread it on the corn meal paste down the
center; roll up the husks, fold in the ends and tie with narrow strips
of husks. The corn meal must surround the chicken mixture. Lay the
prepared tamales carefully on top of the bones keeping them above the
broth. Sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and cover the kettle and cook
steadily one hour, being careful that the broth doesn't boil over the
tamales. For the novice, it is easier to steam the tamales over the
broth in a flat covered steamer. Serve very hot in the husks. Minced
beef may be used instead of chicken and often one cup of chopped
tomatoes are added to the chillies before cooking.--Contributed.

CHILE-CON-CARNE.--Cook chillies as in tamale recipe, add to the sieved
chillies one pint of thick strained tomato pulp, one minced large
onion, one fourth teaspoon salt and cover and simmer fifteen minutes.
Cut dark meat from a boiled or roasted chicken, into small pieces or
use small pieces of cooked veal, cover with the chilli sauce and stew
slowly one hour or stand over hot water and steam about an hour or
until chicken has practically absorbed the sauce.--Contributed.

CHILLI MINO PAN CAKES.--Make a light fritter or pan cake batter and fry
cakes in hot olive oil or butter shaking them until they are set.
Spread these cakes with chicken and chilli mixture (as prepared for
tamales) roll up the pan cakes, pour over more of the sauce, sprinkle
with grated cheese and serve immediately.--Contributed.

RICE AND CHICKEN CON-CARNE.--One pint of stewed chicken cut up in
chicken broth and seasoned with three cooked chillies (sieved) half a
cup of washed rice, half a pint of finely minced cooked tongue, one
teaspoon of salt. Stir often and cook until rice has absorbed most of
the broth but do not let it scorch. Serve with half a pint of strained
tomato cooked with one tablespoon of butter and a little
salt.--Contributed.




Meat

    "Room! Make way! Hunger commands. My valour must obey."--Beaumont
    and Fletcher.


TO JUDGE GOOD BEEF.--Good beef, if young, will be of a bright red
color, fine grained and firm to the touch. The fat of a clear straw
color with a little of it through the muscles, giving the meat a
marbled appearance. The suet should be dry and crumbly and of a darker
shade than the fat. In old beef both flesh and fat will be darker, much
coarser in fiber and decidedly dry compared with young beef. If the
beef is of a pale, dull color, and flabby, it is not well matured; if
very dark and colored and coarse grained with deep yellow fat it will
be found tough and tasteless and if it bears greenish tints and feels
slippery on the surface it is already stale and unfit for use. When
meat is tough add a little vinegar or a piece of lemon to the water in
which it is boiled. This will result in a shortening of time and a
saving of fuel, while the meat will be rendered more easy of digestion;
also any slight taint that may be about the meat will be entirely
removed by this process. A pinch of baking soda can be used instead of
lemon or vinegar.

POT ROAST.--Take a nice piece of the round beef weighing about four
pounds, season well with salt and pepper and dust over thoroughly with
flour. In a flat bottomed kettle melt a piece of butter the size of an
egg, when hot put in the meat, turning until well browned on every
side. When roast is brown add a little onion, six cloves, six allspice
and enough boiling water to come up half way to the top of the meat.
Cook slowly for three hours. When done take out meat, add one
tablespoon of flour to a little cold water to thicken gravy.

MEAT BALLS.--Two pounds round steak, put through sausage grinder three
times, season with salt and pepper, nutmeg and a little cream. Beat two
eggs and mix all together; shape into balls and roll in cracker crumbs
and fry in butter to a light brown.

BAKED VEAL CUTLETS.--One and one half pounds of veal cutlets laid in
well buttered roasting pan with one cup of water; over this spread
dressing made of two cups bread crumbs; two onions chopped fine, two
well beaten eggs; butter size of an egg, salt and pepper. Mix well, add
water to moisten. Lay tin cover on top of pan to prevent scorching.
Bake from half to three quarters of an hour. Remove cover to brown.

ROAST SPARE RIBS.--Trim off ends neatly, crack ribs across the middle,
rub with salt, sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff with turkey
dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with one pint water,
baste often. Turn over once so as to bake both sides equally.

ROAST VEAL LOAF.--Four pounds of veal, one pound of pork, one or two
eggs, one cup of crackers rolled fine, one tablespoon of salt, one
teaspoon of pepper, one teaspoon of sage, mix and make into roll. Bake
three hours.

STEAMED VEAL LOAF.--To two pounds of veal, put through a grinder or
chopped very fine, add two teaspoons of salt, one fourth teaspoon
pepper, butter size of an egg, one cup freshly grated bread crumbs, two
eggs, two tablespoons milk. Knead until well mixed. Butter baking
powder cans, coat with bread crumbs and fill compactly with the meat
and put on cover. Stand in a kettle of water almost to the top of mold.
Boil steadily one and one half hours. When cool take out at once.

STUFFED BEEF STEAK.--Prepare a dressing as for chicken, of one cup of
bread crumbs moisten with one tablespoonful of melted butter, one
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Trim off
the fat from a sirloin steak, spread on the dressing; roll up; tie to
keep in shape, and bake one hour. Baste often with stock and drippings.
When done remove the string that it may not unroll and serve with brown
sauce. Mushrooms may be added to the dressing if desired. (Roll may be
steamed instead of roasted if desired.)

SAUCE.--Melt and brown one large tablespoonful butter, add to it two
tablespoonfuls of flour, stir until it is smooth and brown, then add
one pint of the liquid strained from the pan. Stir until it thickens,
take from the fire and add one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce;
season with salt and pepper.

DIRECTIONS FOR BOILING HAM.--Put the ham in cold water over night and
boil in the same water in the morning. When done skin it and roll it in
crackers mixed with pepper, and put into oven to brown.

VEAL LOAF.--Two pounds of veal chopped, one half pound salt pork,
chopped or put through meat grinder twice. Add one egg, twelve
crackers, rolled fine, salt and pepper to taste. Bake one and one half
hours. (The above meat recipes were demonstrated in American Cookery
series by Mrs. A. McKay.)

VEAL STEW, WITH LEMON AND EGG SAUCE.--Four pounds veal, salt and
pepper, stew the veal until tender, drain off the broth, leaving barely
enough to cover the meat. Beat six eggs and add slowly to them, beating
all the time, the juice of three lemons. Pour this over the veal and
heat but do not boil.--Mrs. Aaron J. Bessie.

NORWEGIAN MEAT PUDDING.--Take five pounds of round steak, quarter pound
beef suet, grind ten or twelve times, add salt, nutmeg, one cup sweet
cream, one pint milk, mix well. Bake in pudding tin with funnel in
center. Set tin in pan of boiling water. Bake one hour.

PUDDING SAUCE.--Drain liquid from pudding when done. To this add sweet
cream, thicken with flour and milk. Season with salt, nutmeg and
capers. This will serve ten or twelve people.--Mrs. R. Meidell.

BOILED MEAT BALLS.--One pound of round steak, one egg, one slice of
bread, two tablespoons melted butter, one teaspoon salt, a dash of
pepper. Trim off all the fat, skin and bones, wash them and put on
stove in cold water with one onion, piece of celery, a little parsley
and salt to taste. Let boil one hour. Chop or grind the meat, soak the
bread in water and press, then mix with all ingredients and form into
balls the size of an egg, and boil in the above broth ten minutes. For
the gravy brown one tablespoon butter, one of flour, add the broth and
stir smooth. Put meat balls into a deep dish and pour gravy over
them.--Mrs. J. Bruegger.

MARYLAND BAKED HAM.--Soak a ham over night in cold water and boil it
tender in sweet cider or water, putting it on in enough liquid to
cover. It must be tender but not broken. Remove the rind, outline the
fat on top into diamonds, placing a clove in each. Rub half a cup of
maple syrup into ham, sprinkle with pepper, place in oven and brown,
sprinkling with sifted bread crumbs if liked. Serve hot or if sliced
cold, lay plate and heavy weight on ham over night to make nice firm
slices.--Mrs. Whitehead. Southern Cookery demonstration.

LULA'S CORNED BEEF.--Five pounds rump beef or sirloin, five tablespoons
salt, three tablespoons brown sugar. Saltpetre size of a hickory nut.
Dissolve the ingredients in enough water to cover the beef, and let the
meat stand in the brine twenty four hours. Boil meat in the same brine
three and a half hours. Quick, simple and good as it gives the
purchaser a chance to select the cut of meat she prefers for
corning.--Contributed.

SPICED BEEF LOAF.--Two and one half pounds of round steak put through a
food chopper, with one fourth pound of salt pork; one teaspoonful of
dried and rolled bread crumbs; two scant cupfuls of milk, one beaten
egg, one teaspoon of butter; one teaspoonful of salt; one half teaspoon
each of cinnamon, cloves, mace and allspice, a dash of cayenne pepper.
Mix into one large loaf and lay in a buttered roasting pan. (I use two
individual bread tins using one loaf hot for dinner and reserving the
other to slice cold.) Add a cupful of hot water to each baking pan;
sprinkle sifted bread crumbs over the meat and dot with butter. Bake
covered until brown and tender basting often but do not cook until hard
and dry. Serve with the gravy or hot tomato sauce, horseradish or
mayonaise.--Mrs. Whitehead.

FAAR I KAAL. NORWEGIAN.--Get twenty cents worth of leg of mutton, cut
in small pieces. Put in the kettle one layer of mutton, one medium
sized head of cabbage cut into six pieces, four potatoes, cut in
halves, two medium sized carrots, quartered. Between each layer of meat
and vegetables add salt, whole peppers and a little flour. Set the
kettle on the stove and add about one quart of water. Let boil slowly
for at least three hours. When done remove from fire and serve. This
will serve three people.--Mrs. R. Meidell.

ROUND STEAK STEW.--Take one and one half quarter pounds of round steak
and pound it well, roll in flour and fry (same as any other steak) over
this pour one pint of boiling water, season with salt, pepper and a
little onion. Let stew one hour or until tender.--Mrs. R. Meidell.

STEAMED VEAL LOAF.--Take two pounds raw veal, grind, two teaspoons
salt, one fourth teaspoon pepper, butter size of an egg, one cup
freshly grated bread crumbs, two eggs, two tablespoons milk, knead
until well mixed. Butter baking powder cans, coat with bread crumbs,
fill compactly with the meat, put on cover, stand in kettle of water
almost to the top of the mold. Boil steadily one and one half hours.
When cool remove from molds at once. Can be eaten hot.--Mrs. Paul
Leonhardy.

JELLIED VEAL OR CHICKEN.--Three pounds of stewing veal shank or
chicken, one tablespoon of chopped onion, one tablespoon chopped
celery; one level teaspoon of salt, dash of pepper. Cover with water
and boil steadily until the meat is very tender and liquor reduced.
Remove the meat from the liquor, free it from gristle and bones and
chop fine. Strain the liquor, stir it through the meat and pack in a
square mold, laying a heavy weight on top. Serve it cold, cut in thin
slices and garnished with sliced hard boiled eggs, sliced lemon or
pickled beets.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SCRAMBLED CALF'S BRAINS.--Soak two pounds of calf's brains in strong
salt water one hour. Then carefully remove all membrane and blood
clots. Dip the brains in flour and fry brown in hot drippings, bacon
preferred. Hash the brains with a knife and scramble four fresh eggs
with them, season with salt and pepper, tossing well together with a
knife until nicely browned. Serve with toast or hot buttered rolls or
baking powder biscuit.--Contributed.

CROWN OF LAMB WITH CURRIED RICE BALLS.--Have the marketman prepare the
rack of lamb for a "crown" roast by scraping the flesh from the ribs
half way down, joining the rack together and fastening it firmly.
Sprinkle with pepper and salt, wrap the ribs in oiled paper and roast
in a brisk oven. Baste often and allow fifteen minutes to each pound.
Garnish with rice balls made as follows: Steam one cupful of rice until
tender. Make two cupfuls of sauce by melting two tablespoonfuls of
butter, adding one teaspoonful currie powder, one saltspoonful of onion
juice, and two tablespoonfuls flour, and stock, or water and milk, and
one half teaspoonful of salt. Cook until smooth, then add sufficient
sauce to the rice to form into balls; reheat them in a steamer, dip
them in the sauce which has been kept warm and fill the crown.

MINT JELLY.--Is a toothsome accompaniment to roast lamb, and is a novel
variation to the customary mint sauce. Soak one cupful of chopped mint
in one pint of water for one hour. Strain, heat to the boiling point
and pour over one half box of gelatin which has been softened in half a
teacup of cold water. Add three tablespoonfuls of sugar, four
tablespoonfuls lemon juice and a saltspoonful of salt. Pour into molds
and set in a cold place to harden. Turn out on chilled saucers just
before serving.--Contributed.

TONGUE IN PORT WINE.--Boil a beef's tongue until it is tender enough to
stick a fork through; put it in cold water and remove the skin; set it
away until cold; save the water in which it was boiled and put it on
the stove with four small onions and two small carrots, boil until the
vegetables are tender, then remove the carrots and mash the onions into
pieces; brown two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, add it to the liquor,
with a level teaspoonful each of allspice, cloves and mace, and pepper
and salt to taste. Blend two tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour,
thicken the liquor with this and add three quarters of a cup of port
wine. Split the tongue lengthwise, put it in the liquor and heat
thoroughly, and serve with the sauce.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SYRIAN STEW.--To be eaten with boiled rice. Neck of mutton will do
nicely for this. Separate the fat from the lean meat. Mince the fat and
melt it in frying pan. Cut the lean meat into chunks about a cubic
inch, more or less, in size, and fry in a hot fat. Have at hand an
earthen cooking vessel; remove the meat from frying pan when done and
drop into the earthen vessel. Have ready the vegetables, also cut into
chunks (not slices), and brown in the fat, removing them as they brown
and putting them with the meat. Next, slice two large or four small
Spanish onions (slicing not into rings, but first into halves,
lengthwise; next slicing each half lengthwise), and fry until well done
(sprinkling them with salt hastens the process). Add these to the meat
and vegetables, then add a cupful of canned or fresh tomato and a small
quantity of water, seasoned with salt and that brown pepper which is
more spicy than hot; let it come to a boil and simmer gently. It should
be begun two hours before mealtime. Any vegetable will do. Vegetable
marrow is excellent, but this should be allowed to steam for awhile
with the meat and onions before the tomatoes are added and cooked
without water. For potatoes, add a few cloves or a small piece of
cinnamon bark to flavor. Celery stew is excellent and cabbage also is
good; but for either of these omit the tomatoes and add some lemon
juice shortly before removing from fire. Such vegetables as celery,
cabbage and haricot beans should not be browned in the fat, but stirred
about for awhile in the cooking vessel with the meat and onions, and
thus fried slightly before adding the water. There is an infinite
variety of these stews, all on the same principle.

BOILED RICE.--To accompany Syrian stew.--A double boiler is not
necessary. Wash the rice until the water is clear, removing any foreign
grains or dirt. Have ready in a saucepan double the quantity of boiling
water that you have of rice, in which has been melted a lump of butter.
When the water boils hard drop in the rice, add a rounded teaspoonful
of salt to every cup of rice and boil gently, uncovered. Do not stir.
For very hard rice allow two and one half cups of water to a cup of
rice. You will soon learn just the quantity required. By the time the
water dries out the rice should be done and each grain firm and
separate. Allow a generous teaspoonful of butter to each cup of rice.
One cup is sufficient for two persons. When the water gets low, taste
the rice, and if you find it is still hard add a little more boiling
water, or cover and remove to the back of the stove to finish
slowly.--Contributed.

HOME MADE SAUSAGE.--Grind six pounds of raw lean fresh pork and three
pounds of raw fat pork to a pulp. Put it in a large graniteware pan and
add twelve teaspoons of powdered sage, six teaspoons of ground black
pepper, six teaspoons of dry salt and one teaspoon each of ground
cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Mix the seasoning well into the meat and
pack it into stone jars, as closely as possible. Pour melted lard or
paraffine wax over the top, which will be all the protection it will
require. All winter as wanted make it into small cakes and fry
brown.--Contributed.

HEAD CHEESE.--This is made of the head, ears and tongue of a pig. Boil
them after cleaning them, in salted water until tender. Strip the meat
from the bones and chop (not grind) very fine. Season with salt,
pepper, sage and powdered cloves, to taste; then add one cup of good
vinegar. Mix all together thoroughly and pack hard into molds or bowls,
interspersing bits of the tongue cut into oblongs and triangles an inch
in length. Wet a plate and press down on the top of each mold and place
a weight on top of that. In two days it will be ready to eat. If you
desire to keep it several weeks you can turn it out of the molds and
immerse in cold vinegar in stone jars. This will preserve it admirably
and you have only to pare away the outside if too acid for your
taste.--Contributed.

PHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE.--Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the
flesh slips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine.
Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the
cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it
boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt.
Let it boil again and thicken with corn meal as you would in making
ordinary corn meal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers
to prevent lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first,
afterwards putting back on the range in a position to boil gently. When
done, pour into a long, square pan, not too deep, and mould. In cold
weather this can be kept several weeks. Slice and saute in butter or
dripping.--Contributed.

MUTTON ROAST.--Just cover the breast of mutton with water, adding a
little salt. Set over the fire, and when it comes to a boil place over
a more moderate heat and simmer for three hours. Then take it up on a
platter, draw out the bones, make a stuffing of bread crumbs, parsley,
thyme, salt, pepper and a little melted suet or butter; lay this on the
meat, roll it up and fasten with skewers. Cover thickly with egg and
bread crumbs and bake in a good oven fifteen minutes to each pound of
meat. When it begins to brown baste frequently with the pan drippings.
Serve on a bed of cress.--Contributed.

FRIED HAM WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Trim off the edges; put into a hot pan
with one teaspoonful of drippings, put over hot fire and keep turning
the ham. Never put into pan and fry on one side before turning. You
must keep turning constantly. When nice and brown on both sides remove
to a hot platter. Put one tablespoonful of flour into pan, mix well and
add one cup of cold milk slowly, stir and boil three minutes. Pour over
ham.--Contributed.

HAM JELLY.--Mix two cupfuls of boiled ham, chopped and pounded very
fine, with one teaspoonful of French mustard, a good dash of cayenne,
one teaspoonful of granulated gelatin dissolved in one half cupful of
hot water (with a teaspoonful of beef extract if at hand), and
finally with one half cupful of cream which has been whipped. When
thoroughly blended press into a wet square mold and place on ice for
two or three hours. It will keep for a day or two. When ready to
serve cut in thin slices and put on each a teaspoonful of mayonnaise
dressing in which a little freshly grated horseradish and whipped
cream have been stirred. Two tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise, four
tablespoonfuls of whipped cream and one tablespoonful of horseradish
will be the right proportions.--Contributed.

GOULASH.--Use two pounds of lean beef cut into neat pieces; chop an
onion, half a carrot and one eighth of a green pepper; place all in a
kettle with two cups of stock, or water will do, cover and stew gently
for two hours; add five small sour pickles in the kettle with the meat,
a teaspoonful of salt; continue to stew for half an hour longer. Remove
the meat on a hot platter, place the pickles around the meat, thicken
the gravy with a little flour and water and pour the gravy around the
meat.

JELLIED VEAL.--One or two knuckles of veal boiled until very tender in
water to cover. Strain the juice and cut the meat into small pieces or
chop fine, season with salt, pepper and a little powdered sage; put
back into strained broth and boil until nearly dry. Add juice of one
lemon and turn into a mold, press well and let it stand until cold and
firm. Slice in thin slices. For pressed beef use minced parsley instead
of sage and omit the lemon juice. For pressed chicken omit the parsley
and sage, add the lemon juice to the chicken broth and mould with a
layer of sliced hard boiled eggs placed in the center of the
loaf.--Contributed.

PORK PATTIES.--One cup chopped pork, two cups bread crumbs, two beaten
eggs and one half cup milk, season with butter, salt and pepper, (and
sage if liked). Fill buttered gem tins and bake until nicely
brown.--Mrs. A. McKay.

CREAMED DRIED BEEF.--Pick half a pound of chipped dried beef into small
pieces and bring it to a boil in water to cover. Drain, add one
tablespoon of butter and dredge with one large tablespoon of flour, add
two cupfuls of milk or cream and cook thick. Season with pepper. Nice
for breakfast or lunch. Make creamed codfish the same way.--Contributed.

HAMBURG HASH.--One pound hamburg steak, two tablespoonfuls butter,
eight or ten potatoes, one small onion, one small bunch parsley, one
teaspoonful celery salt, half teaspoonful common salt, paprika for
seasoning, half cupful hot water. Having all these things chopped and
ready, melt the butter in a frying pan and toss the onion about in the
pan until it becomes colored. Add the chopped beef and stir it until it
has become nicely browned. Add the hot water, stirring thoroughly; then
add the potatoes, parsley, paprika and salt. Stir about until well
cooked. Turn out on a hot dish and serve promptly, garnished with
parsley.

CORN BEEF HASH.--Make like above hamburg hash but use cold, chopped
cooked corn beef and omit the onion and celery salt.

    "It is not what we intend, but what we do that makes us
    useful."--H. W. Beecher.


TOMATO SAUCE.--Take a quart can of tomatoes, put it over the fire in a
stew pan, put in one slice of onion, add two cloves, a little pepper
and salt, boil about twenty minutes; then remove from the fire and
strain it through a sieve. Now melt in another pan an ounce of butter,
and as it melts sprinkle in a tablespoonful of flour, stir it until it
browns and froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with it, and it is
ready for the table. Excellent for mutton chops and roast beef.

TOMATO SAUCE.--Melt one tablespoon of butter, rub in one tablespoon of
flour, half teaspoon salt, a little pepper, add one pint hot milk, cook
until well done, stirring all the time to keep it smooth. Pass a few
stewed tomatoes through the sieve to remove seeds, enough to give
thirteen teaspoons for the sauce. Stir in just before serving. Serve
with fish by pouring a few spoonfuls over each piece.

CREAM SAUCE.--Put two tablespoons butter in a pan, add two tablespoons
flour, mix well together, pour on gradually one cup scalded milk,
stirring all the time, one quarter teaspoon salt and a little white
pepper. Cook thick.

tablespoonful of butter, half teaspoonful of salt, dash of pepper. Melt
the butter being careful not to brown it, add the flour, mix until
smooth then add the cream or milk, stir continually until it boils; add
salt and pepper, and use at once. If you are not quite ready to use it
stand over boiling water to keep warm, stirring often to prevent a
crust forming on top.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.--For baked or boiled fish. One half cup butter,
yolks of two eggs, juice of half a lemon, one saltspoonful salt,
quarter saltspoonful cayenne pepper, one and one half cups boiling

cayenne pepper to taste. Add the egg to the thickened milk when you
have stirred in the butter and oil. Take from fire, season and let
stand in hot water three minutes covered, then put in lemon juice and
turn over salmon immediately. Note: Above recipes for sauces were
demonstrated by Mrs. A. McKay at Domestic Science club.

HORSERADISH SAUCE.--Add to six tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish the
yolk of one egg and half a teaspoonful of salt. Mix thoroughly; add a
tablespoonful of good vinegar and then carefully a quarter of a cupful
of cream whipped to a stiff froth. If the horseradish is already in
vinegar omit the tablespoonful of vinegar and press dry the
horseradish. This is one of the nicest sauces to serve with cold mutton
or with hot corned beef.

HORSERADISH CREAM SAUCE.--Beat one tablespoonful of cream until stiff.
As cream begins to thicken add gradually three-fourths teaspoonful of
vinegar. Season with a few grains of salt and a dash of paprika, then
fold in one half tablespoonful of grated horseradish root.

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE.--Heat two tablespoons of butter in 2 tablespoons of
vinegar and of chopped onion and one half pint of boiling water. Beat
the yolks of two eggs light and mix with one tablespoon of flour, one
half teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper. Cook gently in the hot
vinegar and water and strain at once into the serving dish. This is
nice with fish and with white asparagus boiled, drained and chilled on
the ice. Serve the sauce hot.

MUSHROOM SAUCE.--Add one can of mushrooms to white or cream sauce and
stand over hot water ten minutes but do not cook. Serve with chicken or
sweet bread.

CUCUMBER SAUCE.--Pare four cucumbers, throw them into cold water for
half an hour then grate them and drain. Add one tablespoon of grated
onion and one half teaspoon of salt, one saltspoon of pepper and two
tablespoons of vinegar (Tarragon if convenient). Whip six tablespoons

at once with creamed fish, deviled salt fish or baked or broiled fish
or with cold boiled or baked mutton.

CLARET OR WINE SAUCE FOR GAME.--One half pint of claret or sherry, four
tablespoons soup stock or water, one tablespoon lemon juice, one
teaspoon grated horseradish, one saltspoon paprika and one half
teaspoon of salt. Heat gently but do not boil. Serve hot with game.

SAUCE TARTARE.--Add two olives, one pickle or gherkins, one tablespoon
of capers and one tablespoon of parsley all chopped fine together, to
one half pint of mayonnaise dressing or to hot hallandaise sauce.

MINT SAUCE.--Twelve stalks of fresh mint, one tablespoon of sugar and
one half cup of vinegar or lemon juice. Strip the mint leaves from the
stalks and wash them, chop them very fine, add the sugar and mix well,
add the vinegar, stir well, and cover and stand aside for an hour.
Serve in sauce boat, with spring lamb.

APPLE SAUCE.--One pound green apples, one pint water, one half cup
sugar. Core the apples but do not pare them. Cook with the water in a
covered sauce pan. Press through a colander, add sugar to the pulps and
cool. Serve with duck, goose and pork roast.

GOOSEBERRY SAUCE.--One pint green gooseberries, one tablespoon of
butter, one saltspoon of grated nutmeg, four tablespoons soup stock,
one half teaspoon of salt. Cook the gooseberries tender with the water
in a covered saucepan about ten minutes. Press through a sieve and add

of sugar to the hot pulp, stir until melted and then cool. Serve with
turkey, chicken, mutton or game and with escalloped oysters.

CURRANT JELLY SAUCE.--Add one glass of currant jelly to four
tablespoons of hot water or rich soup stock. Turn this into the dish in
which game has been roasted, bring to a boil and serve.

CURRY SAUCE.--One tablespoon butter, cooked with one tablespoon chopped
onion, add one teaspoon of curry powder, one tablespoon of flour and
stir smooth, then add one half pint of boiling water. Add one half
teaspoon of salt and one tablespoonful of lemon juice after the sauce
has cooked thick. Serve with canned chicken; with oysters, and with
boiled rice, lima beans, cauliflower or cooked tomatoes.

BECHAMEL SAUCE.--Make like cream sauce using half cup of chicken stock
and half cup of milk instead of milk alone adding one tablespoon
chopped cooked carrots, one tablespoon chopped onion, cooked, and one
saltspoon of celery seed. For French Bechamel sauce add one half can
mushroom and two tablespoons of cream.

EGG SAUCE.--Add four hard boiled eggs, chopped fine, to cream sauce.

CAPER SAUCE.--Add one tablespoon capers to cream sauce.

BROWN SAUCE.--Drain the liquor from the pan in which meat is roasted
reserving about four tablespoons of the fat for the sauce. Leave it in
the roasting pan and brown two tablespoons of flour in it over the
fire, blending it well. When smooth add one pint of hot stock or water,
and a little salt or kitchen bouquet if preferred. To this gravy or
meat sauce, variety is given by adding one tablespoon of tomato catsup
or of Worcestershire sauce, or of mushroom catsup or of onion juice or
one half can of mushrooms.

QUICK TOMATO AND CHILI RELISH FOR LOBSTER, SHELL FISH AND HAM.--Six
tomatoes peeled, chopped and drained, two tablespoons minced celery or
one half teaspoon celery seed, two tablespoons of vinegar, a little
garlic or onion, one chopped chili pepper or one drop of tabasco sauce
and one teaspoon of salt. If chili pepper is used bake it until skin
cracks open, then peel and seed and chop fine. Let it cool and add to
the tomato mixture. This is a relish served when ripe tomatoes are in
season. It is not cooked. By substituting one cup of whipped cream for
the vinegar and omitting the tabasco sauce, a nice sauce is quickly
made to serve with cold beef, mutton or veal.

PIQUANTE SAUCE OR OLIVE OR VINEGAR SAUCE.--One tablespoon of chopped
onion, one tablespoon of capers, two tablespoons of chopped pickles, or
teaspoon of sugar, one half teaspoon of salt, two tablespoons of
vinegar, one half saltspoon of pepper, four tablespoons of soup stock

Bread and Rolls

    "The loaf is, after all, the thing that's most essential."--J. W.
    Foley.


WHITE AND RYE BREAD.--While boiling potatoes I save the potato water,
about one pint. After it is cooled and only luke warm, I soak in it one
cake of yeast foam, one teaspoonful of sugar and a small pinch of
ginger, and then let it dissolve until supper time; then take a quart
of wheat flour and mix with a little warm water, or water and milk, and
add your yeast so that the sponge will not be too thin, but like a
stiff batter. Let it stand over night in a warm place to raise. Next
morning I divide the sponge, using two thirds of it for wheat bread and
one third for rye bread, as you can bake six loaves of bread from one
cake of yeast; four of wheat and two of rye. To the two thirds part of
sponge I take two quarts of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of salt and
water enough to make quite a stiff dough. For the rye bread one quart
of rye flour with one and one half cups of wheat flour and one
teaspoonful of salt. Knead it same as for wheat bread, then let it
raise again and when it has doubled in size, it is ready for the tins
and after raising there until light, it is ready for the oven in which
if hot it will bake in from three fourths to one hour. Before putting
it in the oven, I usually wash it with luke warm milk to give it a nice
brown color while baking.--Mrs. John Bruegger. Demonstration of German
Cookery, breads and cookies.

GERMAN COFFEE CAKE.--Next comes German coffee cake and rolls. I set the
sponge with one cake of yeast as for bread and mix it the next morning
with two cups of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoons of
lard, three eggs, grated rind and juice of one lemon, a little nutmeg,
a teaspoonful of salt, add two quarts of white flour, and knead with
milk and water, not quite so stiff as for bread. Let it raise two hours
after which put it in tins and let raise again; then melt butter and
spread on coffee cake and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and it is
ready for the oven and ought to be quickly baked. From this dough you
can bake quite a variety, for instance, one dozen rolls, two plain
coffee cakes, one dozen raised doughnuts and one loaf cake. For the
loaf cake you add one cupful of raisins, a little chopped citron,
almond extract, one egg and a little butter, beat well with a spoon and
fill in a sponge cake tin and let it raise before putting it in the
oven to bake, then bake three quarters of an hour.--Mrs. John Bruegger.
German Cookery demonstration.

RYE BREAD.--To one pint of water (luke warm) add one cake of yeast
foam, one teaspoon salt, two tablespoons sugar, and one medium sized
boiled potato. Mash this fine and mix with the salt and sugar in the
water; let this stand until evening, then add enough well sifted flour
to make a stiff batter. Set in a warm place to rise over night. Next
morning add one quart of luke warm water, one heaping teaspoon salt,
one quart of white flour, and two quarts of rye flour all well sifted,
and work all together, then knead for ten minutes, adding a little
flour from time to time until it ceases to stick to the fingers or mold
board, then put into a large bread pan and set in warm place to rise
again, until light, then knead again, and make into loaves. Put into
well greased bread pans, let raise and bake from one to one and a half
hours. When done take out and brush lightly with melted butter or
drippings.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

WHITE BREAD.--Scald one pint of milk with three tablespoons of lard
then put in bread pan with one quart of warm water; add two tablespoons
sugar, two tablespoons salt. Stir in flour to make a thick batter one
yeast cake that has been soaked well in water. I make sponge after
dinner and let set till evening then mix into a large loaf; let stand
till morning. Before breakfast knead into loaves. This will make from
three to four loaves of bread.--Mrs. Southard.

GRAHAM BREAD.--Make the yeast sponge as above but add one half cup
cooking molasses and a little more sugar. Do not make sponge too thick
with white flour. Mix in evening, with graham flour but not quite as
stiff as white bread. Graham bread is very slow to raise.

DATE BREAD.--One cup of chopped dates, two cups milk, one third cup
sugar, one fourth yeast cake, one fourth cup luke warm water, one half
teaspoon salt, five cups of sifted flour. Mix and knead like bread and
bake in loaves.

POCKET BOOK ROLLS.--Warm one quart new milk, add one cup butter or
lard, four tablespoons sugar and two well beaten eggs. Stir in flour
enough to make a moderately stiff sponge. Add a small cup of yeast and
set in a warm place to rise, which will take three or four hours, then
mix in flour enough to make a soft dough and let rise again. When well
risen dissolve a lump of soda, size of a bean, in spoon of milk and
work into the dough and roll into sheets one half inch thick. Spread
with butter, cut into squares and fold over, pocket book shape. Put in
tins, let rise a while and bake.--Mrs. L. L. Lampman.

ROLLS.--Take two teacupsful of light sponge. Add to it one half cup
shortening, one cup of sugar and two cups of warm water. Mix with flour
and knead but do not make a very stiff dough. Let raise all day. In
evening form rolls and let them raise all night. Bake in moderate
oven.--Mrs. Harry Hanson.

RAISED BISCUITS.--One cup of flour scalded with generous pint of hot
potato water. (Boil potatoes and drain water for this). When cold add
one cake of yeast dissolved in luke warm water. Mix this at noon and
let it stand, uncovered, until night, then add one pint of warm water
and enough flour to make a light sponge, beating well. Let stand until
morning in a warm place or in a covered bread pan well wrapped to
retain the heat. Add to this sponge in the morning one small cup of
sugar, two eggs and one half cupful lard and a generous tablespoon of
salt. Mix stiff with flour. Let stand until light then knead well, let
raise an hour and knead again and make into biscuits. Put in greased
baking pans and let raise until very light. Bake in a moderate
oven.--Mrs. George W. Newton.

ALMOND WREATH.--Two ounces of flour; two cakes of yeast; one pint of
luke warm milk; a tablespoonful of salt. Mix into a light sponge and
let it rise all night. In the morning add six ounces of butter and the
same of pulverized sugar, six eggs, one pint of rich cream and enough
flour to make a soft dough. Let it rise again until very light. Then
roll out with few and swift strokes of the rolling-pin into a sheet
less than half an inch thick and cut into strips. Braid these into a
coronet about some round object in the center. Or you may make it into
a round cake if you like. Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, blanch
and shred them and dry in the oven for a few minutes. Then mix them
with granulated and coffee sugar and cinnamon and strew over the cakes
when you have washed the surface with white of egg to make the mixture
stick. Bake in a moderate oven. This quantity will make at least six
large cakes.

YEAST.--Three heaping tablespoons flour, two of salt, two tablespoons
of sugar. Pour one dipperful of boiling water on this and add twelve
mashed potatoes. Add cold water enough to cool for yeast. Add one yeast
cake which has been soaked one half hour in tepid water. Use half of
this for one baking.--Mrs. A. McKay.




Biscuits, Jems, Pancakes and Fritters

    "What an excellent thing did God bestow on man when He gave him a
    good stomach."--Beaumont and Fletcher.


FRITTERS.--Beat four eggs very light. Do not separate yolks and whites
but beat together about five minutes; add one scant cupful of milk, one
small teaspoon of salt and just a dash of baking powder (about as large
as a small bean). Quickly whisk in enough sifted flour to make a thin
pan cake batter. Beat smooth. Drop by spoonfuls into deep smoking hot
lard and fry like doughnuts. Drain, and serve immediately with maple
syrup, honey or jelly sauce.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

SOUTHERN WAFFLES.--Mix together one scant pint of sifted flour and one
generous pint of milk until smooth; add one half cupful of melted
butter and the well beaten yolks of three eggs; then the well beaten
whites and one half teaspoon of salt. Just before baking add two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder and hot lard. Bake in a hot, well greased
waffle iron and serve immediately with butter and maple syrup or
honey.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

PAN CAKES.--For a family of six, take one quart of butter milk or of
slightly clabbered sour milk. Beat into it two level teaspoons of soda
and one small teaspoon of salt. Add the beaten yolks of two eggs and
then enough flour to make a smooth batter, not too stiff. If too thick
add a little more milk. Lastly add one tablespoon of melted butter and
the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Rub the smoking hot griddle with a
piece of suet fastened to a skewer or fork, drop butter on by
tablespoonful and bake the cakes a nice brown, turning once. Serve
immediately on hot plates. These cakes may be served with butter and
syrup or they may be spread with jam or jelly and rolled. Using half
flour with half corn meal makes good corn cakes or half graham flour
for graham cakes.--Mrs. Whitehead.

CORN OYSTERS OR CORN FRITTERS.--Grate eight large ears of corn, or
split each row of corn down the center and scrape out all of the pulp.
Beat the yolks of two eggs, add them to the corn pulps with half a
teaspoon of salt and the beaten whites of eggs and then add enough
rolled cracker crumbs to make a thick batter. Fry oyster shape, in
deep, smoking fat and put in the oven to crisp while the balance of the
cakes are frying. Do not use flour to thicken the batter. The crackers
are much nicer and give the true oyster flavor. These are made from
fresh, green corn, only.--Mrs. Whitehead.

CORN DODGERS.--Put one cup of corn meal, one half teaspoon of salt in
double boiler; add one cup boiling water; beat smooth and add one
tablespoon butter. Cook and steam covered for one hour. Butter a
griddle, drop by spoonful on it, put down fat and when browned put bit
of butter on each, before turning. Good served with broiled ham or
cooked in frying pan after bacon or sausage.

HOE CAKE.--Put one quart of white corn meal in a bowl; add one teaspoon
salt, add sufficient boiling water to just moisten, stirring all the
time, beating to stiff batter. Moisten hands in cold water and make
corn meal into small round cakes. Bake on plank in front of open fire

Sandwiches

    "There is no higher art than that which tends toward the
    improvement of food."--Henry Ward Beecher.


Bread for sandwiches should be at least one day old. Cut into thin
slices of uniform size, remove all crust and then cut into the desired
shape either with the sharp, pliable knife or a sharp cookie cutter.
The butter should be soft enough to spread smoothly and the most
essential thing is to have good bread and fresh sweet butter. Meat for
filling should either be sliced very thin or chopped fine and other
ingredients minced or mashed to make as smooth a paste as possible and
mix evenly with the salad dressing or other dressing used. Sandwiches
are better eaten as soon as made. If necessary to let them stand an
hour or so, wrap the plate of sandwiches in a dampened napkin and put
in a cold place so the bread will not become hard and dry. Be careful
not to let the dressing run over the outer edge of the slices of bread.
Sandwiches must be dainty to be appetizing and easily handled. Cut the
slices as thin as you can and make into small triangles or squared
sandwiches, or oblong ones two or three inches long.

SANDWICHES.--Mince the white meat of a roast chicken, and mix it with
half a can of French mushrooms, chopped fine, and a half cupful of
chopped English walnuts. Season to taste with melted butter. Put the
mixture between slices of whole wheat bread.

WALNUT SANDWICHES.--Shell English walnuts. Blanch and chop, and to
every tablespoonful of nuts allow a good half teaspoonful of cream
cheese. Rub well together and spread on thin slices of crustless white
or graham bread.

DEVILED EGG SANDWICHES.--Mash the yolks of hard boiled eggs to a powder
and moisten with olive oil and a few drops of vinegar. Work to a paste,
add salt, pepper and French mustard to taste, with a drop or two of
tabasco sauce. Now chop the whites of the eggs as fine as possible or
until they are like a coarse powder and mix them with the yolk paste.
If more seasoning is necessary, add it before spreading the mixture
upon sliced graham bread.

ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES.--Chop rare roast beef very fine, taking care to
use only the lean portions of the meat. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and
a saltspoonful of horseradish. Mix and make into sandwiches with thinly
sliced graham bread.

PEANUT SANDWICHES.--Shell and skin freshly roasted peanuts and roll
them to fine crumbs on a pastry board. Add salt to taste and mix the
powdered nuts with enough fresh cream cheese to make a paste that can
be easily spread on unbuttered bread. Keep in a cold, damp place until
wanted.

STUFFED EGGS.--Boil eggs hard and throw them into cold water. When cool
remove the shells, cut the eggs in half carefully and extract the
yolks. Rub these to a powder with the back of a spoon and add to them
pepper and salt to taste, a little melted butter to make the mixture
into a smooth paste. If ham is not at hand any other cold meat will do,
and either anchovies or anchovy paste may be used. Make the compound
into balls about the size and shape of the yolks and restore them to
their place between the two cups of the whites.

HAM AND OLIVE SANDWICHES.--Chop lean ham fine and beat into each cupful
of the minced meat a tablespoonful of salad oil, a teaspoonful of
vinegar, a saltspoonful of French mustard, six olives chopped fine and
a teaspoonful of minced parsley. Work all to a paste and spread on thin
slices of white bread.

SALMON SANDWICHES.--Small can salmon, one small onion chopped, two hard
boiled eggs chopped, and chopped celery to taste. Mix with a good
mayonnaise dressing and spread between thin, buttered slices of
bread.--Mrs. L. L. Lampman.

HAM SANDWICH.--Run boiled ham through the food chopper or mince it very
fine. This may be spread plain on buttered bread or it may be mixed
with the ground yolks and whites of hard boiled eggs and mixed with
mayonnaise dressing to a paste and spread between thin slices of
buttered bread.

ROLLED SANDWICHES.--Cut the crust from a loaf of bread lengthwise of
the loaf in thin slices. Butter, spread with the ham mayonnaise paste
and roll up like jelly roll, pressing firmly together. Cut in slices
like jelly roll cake slices.

NUT BREAD SANDWICHES.--These are made of nut bread slices spread with
butter. Raisin bread also makes nice sandwiches and so does date bread.

ENGLISH SANDWICHES.--Spread toasted muffins (cold muffins cut into
slices and toasted) with butter, then with cottage cheese or grated
cream cheese. Cover with a thin layer of plum (blue damson preferred)
marmalade, and cover with top slice of toasted muffin.

eggs with three boned sardines or anchovies, mashed, two small pickles
or as many capers chopped, one teaspoon of butter. Spread between thin
slices of buttered graham bread.

salted nuts, minced together with salad dressing. Salted almonds rolled
fine and mixed to a paste with butter are nice on crackers, with a
chafing dish lunch. Bone sardines and mash them to a paste with lemon
juice or oil and spread on thinly sliced bread. Mince canned lobster,
shrimp or crabs fine, mix with minced hard boiled eggs and salad
dressing and spread between buttered slices of bread.

pepper. Melt cheese in the oven and serve hot.

BOILED EGG SANDWICHES.--Run hard boiled eggs through meat grinder and
mix with dry mustard, salt, cayenne pepper and lemon juice or vinegar.
Spread between thin slices of buttered bread. Minced celery or celery
seed is nice mixed with this paste. The grated rind of a lemon added to
ground hard boiled eggs (three), one half cup butter, two tablespoons
of lemon juice, salt and half teaspoon of dry mustard makes a good
devil paste for sandwiches.

OLIVE AND COTTAGE CHEESE SANDWICHES.--Stone olives, or use the stuffed

thin slice of cold meat chicken, (white meat preferred), spread with
mayonnaise salad dressing then put on a layer of shredded lettuce,

bread must be cut very thin to make dainty sandwiches of this delicious
combination. Garnish with quartered dill pickles and olives or pimentos
and parsley.

HOT EGG SANDWICH.--Toast bread in thin slices; lay on a thin slice of

scrambled fine. Lay another hot slice of toast on top and serve.

MINCED MEAT SANDWICHES.--Minced cooked chicken or veal, mixed with
minced celery and then with mayonnaise dressing is the usual paste for
meat sandwiches. The flavor may be varied by adding minced sweet
pickles, sweet canned peppers, olives, pimentos, mushrooms or nuts to
this paste as fancy dictates. Minced boiled ham and boiled chicken in
equal portions make a nice combination. If mayonnaise isn't liked bind
together with soft butter, thick cream, lemon juice or prepared
mustard.

LAYER SANDWICHES.--These are made of different varieties of bread
combined in the same sandwich or of two or more kinds of thinly sliced
cold, cooked meat, placed in alternate layers between slices of
buttered bread or toast. Cold roast duck, either wild or tame, sliced
thinly and placed between buttered slices of raisin bread is nice. Duck
may first be dipped in mayonnaise. Cold boiled tongue sliced thin and
covered with lettuce mayonnaise and then with a thin slice of chicken
or cold boiled ham, make a good layer sandwich. Flaked white fish,
spread with minced shrimp mayonnaise and lettuce or minced celery is
another. Brown bread and white bread cut as thin as wafers, buttered
and spread with cream or cottage cheese and minced olives or nuts and
put together in alternate layers then cut through like layer cake into
oblong strips or finger sandwiches make pretty luncheon sandwiches. Nut
bread and raisin or date bread, sliced, buttered and built in layer
sandwiches are delicious. Rings of Boston brown bread alternated with
rings of white bread and spread with peanut butter is another popular
combination.

SWEET SANDWICHES.--Chop figs, raisins and stoned dates together and
spread on buttered slices of graham or white bread. Dates minced with

make dainty afternoon tea sandwiches. Grated sweet chocolate and ground
nuts mixed smooth with butter or cream is another filling. Grated
cocoanut and dates minced to a paste is another favorite filling.

GAME SANDWICHES.--Cut thin slices of prairie chicken, wild duck or
goose or venison. Dip shredded celery into mayonnaise dressing; lay the
sliced meat on buttered bread, scatter shredded celery over it and
press bread on top. With sliced venison spread currant jelly on the
meat and omit the salad dressing. With sliced turkey use cranberry
jelly. With boiled ham cider jelly, grape jelly or apple jelly is nice.
With sliced roast veal tomato jelly is best. With wild fowl use mild
plum jelly or currant jelly.--Contributed.

tarragon vinegar, and a quarter teaspoonful of white pepper. Stir over
the fire until the gelatine is dissolved, but not a moment longer, turn
at once into egg cups or small molds and set away to harden. Serve on
lettuce leaves with mayonnaise.--Contributed.

TOMATO SALAD WITH MAYONNAISE.--Have as many hallowed out tomatoes or

(which simulate lily pads) to form a circle, leaving a small circular
opening in the middle. Then put in a second row of petals, placing the
pieces between those in the first circle. Lastly press the egg yolks
through a ricer, heaping them in the center of the white petals, to
represent the heart of a lily. Pass a bowl of mayonnaise with the salad
or heap lightly on the surface.--Contributed.

POTATO SALAD.--Boil six medium sized potatoes in jackets, until done
but do not let them break into pieces. They should be firm and dry.
Peel them and cut into thin slices or small dice; mix with two small
onions chopped and two hard boiled eggs, sliced. Mix thoroughly with
boiled salad dressing, after dressing the potatoes first with lemon
juice or vinegar and salt. Let stand on the ice an hour or more.
Garnish the salad bowl with shredded lettuce, diced, boiled or pickled
beets or radish roses or olives, sweet peppers or any favorite
garnish.--Contributed.

FRENCH DINNER SALAD.--The dinner salad should always be delicate and
light. Heavy meat or fish salads are reserved for luncheon or buffet
suppers, where they form the main dish of the meal. The most popular
dinner salad is lettuce dressed with oil and lemon juice or vinegar.
Cress is often used and of late years bleached dandelions are much in
favor. Sliced cucumbers and onion, or sliced tomatoes with shredded
lettuce or chopped celery, and the typical spring salad of shredded
lettuce, sliced young onions and sliced radishes are all liked. In
France the French dressing of oil and vinegar or lemon juice is always
used but in America many prefer the richer mayonnaise dressing. In any
case the salad is never mixed until time to serve it, and then the
dressing should be lightly tossed in when all of the ingredients must
be crisp and cold.--Contributed.

PIMENTO SALAD.--Select sweet, red or green peppers, steam them till the
skin cracks, then skin and seed. Place on the ice and shred with cold
boiled fish, or shell fish or with a mixture of cold, cooked and diced
potatoes, green peas or beans and sliced cucumbers or celery. The
canned sweet red peppers or pimentos may be substituted. Spiced or
pickled green peppers are also nice with a crisp green salad.--Mrs.
Whitehead.




Vegetables

    "Dyspepsia is largely the result of trying to force square meals
    into round stomachs."


TIME FOR BOILING VEGETABLES.--Turnips should be peeled and boiled from
forty minutes to one hour. Beets; boil from one to two hours then put
in cold water then slip the skin off. Spinach; boil twenty minutes in
uncovered kettle if green color is to be retained. Parsnips; boil from
twenty to thirty minutes. String beans should be boiled one and one
half hours, covered. Shelled beans require one hour to cook. Onions
should be boiled from forty minutes to one hour, covered. Green corn;
boil ten to twenty minutes. Green peas should be boiled in very little
water, boil twenty minutes. Asparagus should be cooked the same as
peas. Serve on toast with cream gravy or melted butter. Cabbage should
be boiled from one to two hours in plenty of salted water. Carrots
should be boiled from forty minutes to one hour. Whole potatoes should
be put in boiling salted water and boil rapidly in covered kettle from
fifteen to thirty minutes according to size and age. Test with the
tines of a fork. Drain as soon as tender, remove the cover and set on
back of range to dry. If they are to be mashed do not let them stand
long.

VEGETABLES.--Vegetables of all kinds should be thoroughly picked over
and well washed, and it is good sometimes to lay them into cold water a
short time before cooking. Salt should not be added until partly
cooked, as it has a tendency to harden them; they should cook steadily,
do not allow them to stop boiling or simmering until they are
thoroughly done. Drain, take some butter, heat it, add a little flour,
mix smooth in the butter, add milk enough to make a smooth gravy, turn
over vegetables, and let it heat through, then serve. This sauce is
nice for many kinds. For asparagus, carrots, peas and a few others I
keep some of the liquid they were boiled in, as it gives them a better
flavor than milk alone.

GERMAN CABBAGE.--Another way of preparing cabbage in a German way: Cut
up a cabbage and pick over carefully, wash well, heat some lard, drop
cabbage into the hot grease, stir, so as to get it all heated, then let
fry for a short time, but watch carefully to avoid burning, then add a
quartered cooking apple; now when it gets too dry add hot water from
the tea kettle, and let it simmer for three or four hours, the longer
the better, add salt when almost tender, and about half hour before
serving add quarter cup of sugar, quarter cup of vinegar, and let
simmer the last half hour. This is the real German way.

GREEN STRING BEANS.--Select tender green string beans, cut the ends and
remove strings, dice and wash thoroughly, put on in cold water to
cover, add salt when partly cooked, then diced potatoes, and boil with
beans about half an hour. Then heat either bacon drippings or common
lard, add flour and brown, when ready turn the beans, potatoes, liquor
and all into the hot mixture, add a little vinegar and pepper. Summer
savory sprigs added to above give it a fine flavor.--Mrs. George
Bruegger, German Cookery demonstration of vegetables.

CREAMED POTATOES.--Cut cold boiled potatoes into one half inch cubes,
put these in a sauce pan. Add white sauce and finely cut parsley.
Serve.

sauce pan, add milk, add salt and pepper and potatoes. Cook
thick.--Dorothy Whitehead.

STUFFED POTATOES.--Bake the desired number of potatoes, cut open the
top, scoop out inside, mash. Add butter, salt and pepper, moisten with
hot milk or cream to taste and add beaten whites of two eggs. Fill skin
with this mixture, heap well, brush over with yolk of egg and brown in
oven. Serve hot.--Mrs. R. J. Walker.

STUFFED CABBAGE.--One large cabbage, two pounds beef chopped fine, one
half cup melted butter, one half cup sweet cream or milk, one half
teaspoon ginger, one half teaspoon allspice, salt and pepper to suit
taste, whites of two eggs beaten stiff. Cut the stem end off the
cabbage far enough down to form a cover, scoop out enough of the center
of the cabbage to allow room for the meat. Mix the meat and other
ingredients together and place in the cabbage, put on the cover, tie in
a cloth and boil for three hours, or until the cabbage is done, in salt
water.

SAUCE.--Two thirds cup butter, one half teaspoon each of ginger and
allspice; salt and pepper to suit taste, and one quart milk, thicken
with flour.--Mrs. Aaron J. Bessie.

NORWEGIAN SAUERKRAUT.--One medium sized head of cabbage cut in fine
long strips with a knife, put in kettle, to this add three quarters of
an ounce of flour sprinkled over the top of cabbage, one teaspoon salt,
one teaspoon caraway seed, one pint beef broth. Let this boil slowly
until tender, stir every few minutes to keep the cabbage from burning.
When done add one teaspoon sugar and one teaspoon vinegar.--Mrs. R.
Meidell.

STEWED OKRA AND TOMATO (CREOLE).--Twelve pods of okra sliced thin, four
tomatoes sliced. Stew with salt and pepper and butter, half an hour
slowly, add dash cayenne pepper and serve.

SOUTHERN SWEET POTATOES.--Slice cold boiled sweet potatoes. Lay in a
buttered baking dish, sprinkle with sugar and dot with butter. Bake

POTATO SOUFFLE.--Four good sized potatoes boiled and mashed fine, one
half teacup of milk, one tablespoon butter. Let butter and milk come to
a scald, add potatoes, a little salt and pepper, beat to a cream, add
slowly the beaten yolks of four eggs. Beat the whites to a stiff froth,
add them to the mixture. Do not beat often adding the white of egg.
Bake twenty minutes in a brisk oven. Serve while hot with meats that
have gravy.--Mrs. Mary Harvey.

COLD SLAW.--This is a creole dish and very delicious. Cut very fine a
quarter of a head of firm white cabbage. Put it into a covered dish,
pour over it one half cupful of vinegar, one half tablespoonful of salt
and toss it about lightly with a fork. Into a skillet pour one half
cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of butter and one quarter of a cupful of
sugar. Beat one egg light. Let the milk come to a boil, mix a
teaspoonful of the milk with the egg, add sugar and butter, allow it to
cook until a custard is formed, then pour over the sliced cabbage.
Allow it to become very cold before using. As vinegars differ do not
use so much if very strong.--Mrs. A. McKay.

CANNED STRING BEANS.--Prepare the beans as for dinner--that is, string
and break into one inch pieces. Have your cans and top all cleansed;
then fill the cans with the beans--after washing them, of course--and
shake them down. Put one teaspoonful of salt to a quart of beans after
the cans are full. Now put fresh cold water upon them to overflowing. I
run a thin knife between the can and the beans to get all the air
bubbles out. Put on the rubbers and then the lids, but not tight--only
as you can with the thumb and one finger. Lay thin boards in the bottom
of the boiler and set your can on them; fill to the lids with cold
water. I let them boil two hours after they are fairly at it; then I
take them out one by one, and screw down the tops and set to get cold
before putting away. When we eat them I drain off all the water, put in
a piece of butter and pepper and milk, or any way I want them. I never
lost a can.--Contributed.

NUT LOAF.--Two cupfuls bread crumbs, one cup chopped walnuts, one half
cup butter, one cup strained tomatoes, one small grated onion, one egg,
salt and pepper to taste. Pack in a can and steam one hour.--Mrs. A.
McKay.

hot milk, three level tablespoons butter, yolk of one egg, one half
level teaspoon salt, one eighth level teaspoon paprika, one teaspoon
lemon juice, one level teaspoon chopped parsley. Cook the potato in
boiling salted water until tender. Drain and put into double boiler;
add milk and cook until it is nearly absorbed. Cream the butter, add to
it the egg yolk slightly beaten, add the salt, paprika and lemon juice.
Stir this mixture into the potatoes and as soon as cooked turn into a
hot dish, sprinkle with the parsley and serve.--Contributed.

HOMINY FRITTERS.--Break up two cups of cold cooked hominy with a fork.
Add one scant cup of milk, a pinch of salt, one beaten egg and one half
cup of flour in which one level teaspoon of baking powder is sifted.
Drop by spoonfuls into hot lard and fry until a delicate
brown.--Contributed.

TOMATO SOUFFLE.--One can tomatoes, two level tablespoons butter, two
level tablespoons flour, one half teaspoon salt, one eighth level
teaspoon paprika, one teaspoon onion juice, one fourth cup fine bread
crumbs, three eggs. Drain the tomatoes and cook the liquid down to one
cup. Cut the tomatoes into small pieces using one cup free from seeds.
Melt the butter. Add the flour, salt and paprika and when blended add
the cup of tomato liquid. Stir until thick and smooth. Add the onion
juice, tomato and the bread crumbs. Remove from the fire, and add the
yolks of the eggs beaten very light. Then fold in the white beaten
stiff. Pour into a buttered baking dish and bake in a moderate oven
until light and firm in the center.--Contributed.

POTATO CROQUETTES.--Prepare one pint of hot mashed potatoes seasoned
with one tablespoonful of butter, one half teaspoonful of salt, one half
teaspoonful onion juice. Beat all together until very light, and when
slightly cool add the yolk of one egg. Mix well and put through a sieve
to be sure there are no lumps, as it is almost impossible to get them
out by mashing the potato. And one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Shape
into smooth round balls. Roll them in bread crumbs, then dip into beaten
egg, then roll them in crumbs again. Fry in smoking hot lard one minute,
drain on soft paper and serve in the form of a pyramid.--Contributed.

MUSHROOM AND POTATO CROQUETTES.--Take one pound of mushrooms (the fresh
are preferred to the canned), break in small pieces after rinsing, drop
into three tablespoonfuls of hot butter, dust with half a teaspoonful
of salt and a trifle of pepper, cover and steam slowly for ten minutes;
add to three small cupfuls of seasoned mashed potato, beat in two eggs
and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley: form into cones, egg and crumb
and fry in hot fat.

GERMAN FRIED POTATOES.--Or fried raw potatoes make an appetizing dish
for breakfast. Slice raw potatoes as thin as an egg shell and put them
into a frying pan in which an equal amount of butter and lard is
boiling. Sprinkle them over with salt and pepper and cover with a close
fitting lid and let the steam partly cook them. Fry until golden color.

FRENCH SPINACH.--Boil one half peck spinach until tender in salted
water. Drain, throw into a colander and drench well with cold water.
This gives it a certain firmness and delicacy. Shake free from water,
chop fine and put in a hot sauce pan, salt delicately and heat with
butter and cream. Then heap in a vegetable dish and garnish with
poached or boiled eggs.

WILTED LETTUCE.--Pick fresh, young garden lettuce when it is just big
enough to eat. Wash it and shred it, sprinkle with salt, pepper and a
little sugar. Minced young green onions may be mixed with it if liked.
Cut four or five slices of bacon into cubes or as much ham and fry it
brown in its own grease. Add two tablespoons of vinegar and the yolk of
an egg beaten together and heat in the grease; turn hot over the
prepared lettuce and stir quickly with a fork. Same dressing is nice on
young cooked string beans.--Mrs. Whitehead.

BUTTERED ASPARAGUS.--Cut the tough ends from a bunch of asparagus
(white variety preferred) or the canned may be used. Leave it in five
inch stalks and boil it tender in salted water. Drain, melt three
fourths cup of butter. Lay the asparagus on individual serving plates,
and pour the butter generously over it, or it may be served on toast.
Two tablespoons of thick cream added is liked by many, especially when
the fresh asparagus is used. Asparagus is nice served in the same
manner, cold, with sauce tartar or a thick mayonnaise dressing heaped
at one side of the plate. Dip each stalk in it as it is eaten.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

SCALLOPED CABBAGE.--Chop a head of cabbage quite coarse. Boil it twenty
minutes in salted water, drain. Make a cream sauce and add to the
cabbage, cover with bread crumbs and bake. For varieties take and
sprinkle the top thickly with grated cheese and serve cabbage au
gratin.--Contributed.

CORN SOUFFLE.--One pint of fresh or canned corn cooked in one cup of
milk ten minutes. Season with salt, pepper, one teaspoon of sugar and
one teaspoon of butter. Let it get cold, then add beaten yolks of three
eggs and lastly cut in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs and bake
in a buttered pudding dish.--Contributed.

BEETS.--Boil young beets tender in water to cover. Drain and cover with
cold water then skin them and slice fine. Heat half cup diluted
vinegar, salt, pepper and butter, turn over the prepared beets and
serve.--Contributed.

GREEN BEANS (GERMAN).--String the beans and shred into lengthwise
strips. Cook in salted water until tender, then drain and add some
vinegar dressing as for beets. Serve either hot or cold.--Contributed.

BOILED STRING BEANS AND BACON.--Fill a kettle with green or wax beans,
shredded or broken into inch lengths, insert a piece of bacon or salt
pork (about one pound) in the center of the beans, cover with cold
water and boil gently two or three hours covering the kettle. Add more
salt, if necessary and a good dash of pepper. Let the water about cook
off the beans and serve either hot or cold. Fresh pork may be used with
equal success.

SCALLOPED POTATOES.--Pare and slice six or eight potatoes of uniform
size. Butter a baking dish and spread a thin layer of potatoes on the
bottom. Mix one teaspoon of salt and one quarter teaspoon of pepper
with three tablespoons of flour. Sprinkle a teaspoon of this mixture
over each layer of potatoes, dot each layer with butter and cover with
milk, then add another layer of potatoes and continue until all are
used. Dot the top with butter and put in enough milk to just cover the
potatoes. Cover the baking dish and bake forty minutes or more, uncover
and brown. For potatoes au gratin sprinkle each layer with grated
cheese.--Mrs. Whitehead.




Pickles, Condiments and Spiced Fruits

    "Mingle, mingle, mingle, you that mingle, may."


RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLES.--Pare and seed ripe cucumbers, slice lengthwise
and cut into pieces desired size. Let them stand twenty-four hours
covered with cold vinegar. Drain, then put in fresh vinegar with two

and a tablespoonful of salt. Boil all together twenty minutes. Put in a
crock and cover closely.--Mrs. W. C. Lynch.

GREEN TOMATOES AND ONIONS.--One peck of green tomatoes sliced, and use
about one half as many onions as tomatoes and to this quantity add
three peppers (either green or red) cut in small pieces. Sprinkle
lightly with salt and let stand over night. Drain off liquor and when
dry put them in hot vinegar which has been sweetened and spiced with
cinnamon and cloves. Boil until tender. Leave spice bag in jar.--Mrs.
Lynch.

UNCOOKED MUSTARD PICKLES.--(Excellent). Four quarts small cucumbers,
four quarts small onions, three heads cauliflower, six green peppers.
Dressing: One gallon of vinegar, two pounds of brown sugar, one pound
mustard, one cup of flour. Let pickles stand over night in mild brine.
Drain and put in jar. Then make dressing as follows and pour boiling
hot over them. Boil vinegar and sugar together and thicken with flour
dissolved in cold water. Pour this while boiling over pickles, when
cold add mustard which has been dissolved in cold vinegar.--Mrs. Lynch.

PEACH PICKLE.--Make syrup by using two cups of sugar to one of vinegar.
Tie whole spices up in sacks and put in the syrup. When it comes to
boil drop in peaches from which the skins have been removed by pouring
over boiling water. Stick whole cloves in each peach. Cook until
tender. Be careful not to get mushy by over cooking. I pickle pears in
same way.--Mrs. Harry McKay.

MUSTARD PICKLE.--Get small pearl onions, cauliflower and small
cucumbers. Stand in brine for a week, changing each day. At end of time
pour off brine and rinse in cold water. Prepare the following dressing
and cook pickles for ten minutes. One and a half quarts vinegar,

chopped cabbage, two quarts of chopped onions, sprinkle salt over, let
drain over night. In the morning put over to boil one gallon of
vinegar, stir one and one half pounds of mustard into enough cold
vinegar to mix thoroughly, add to boiling mixture. Then stir into this
the chopped mixture. Keep stirring until it comes to a boil. When cool,
add two ounces of curry powder. Seal in glass cans. Will keep for
years. Excellent for meats.--Mrs. A. McKay.

PICALILLI.--One peck of green tomatoes, eight large onions, seven large
cucumbers, two small heads of cabbage. Pear and chop medium fine. After
well mixed add three quarters cup of salt and let them stand over
night. In the morning, drain well, and add two cups of water, one cup
of vinegar. Boil all together twenty minutes, drain, put back into
kettle, turn over them two quarts of vinegar, one pound of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful
of ginger, one teaspoonful of allspice, one half teaspoonful of cayenne

onions, one cup of sugar, three cups of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of
salt, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and cloves. Cook the tomatoes
tender, chop the onion and peppers very fine, mix all well and cook a
few minutes. Celery improves it. Bottle and seal.--Mrs. Lynch.

GERMAN SAUER KRAUT.--For this use nice, white, firm cabbages, slice
them in very fine shreds, on one of these kraut cutters; place a layer
of salt into a jar or keg, and alternately cabbage and salt, being
careful to have salt on top. As each layer of cabbage is added it must
be pounded down with a heavy pestle, and layers added as soon as the
juice floods on the surface. When the jar is full, it must be set in a
dry place, covered with a cloth, a wooden cover and then weight it down
heavy, after it ferments the pickle must be drawn off and replaced by
fresh until the liquor is clear. Renew the cloth and wash weight and
cover and let stand for a month, then it is ready for use. Great care
must be taken to have the cover perfectly clean. Each time the jar is
opened it must be properly closed and be sure to always have some
liquor on top. Either clear or salt water may be added. Now to boil the
kraut. Put on in cold water, let it come to a boil, and never boil very
fast but let it simmer for four or more hours. Parboil a nice fat piece
of fresh pork and place in same kettle with kraut; let it boil together
for some hours; about one hour before taking it up grate half a small
raw potato into the kraut, let it simmer away. This gives it a nice
flavor and also tends to give it a smoother appearance. The oftener you
warm over sauer kraut the better it gets. They say it should be cooked
nine times. I never tried it for ours never lasted that long.--Mrs.
George Bruegger, demonstrated at Domestic Science club.

GERMAN DILL PICKLES.--Select medium sized cucumbers, as near of a size
as possible, soak over night in a weak brine, or plain well water. Next
day wipe each one carefully, so as not to bruise them, then pack
alternately in grape leaves and dill, start with a layer of leaves and
dill then a layer of cucumbers, and so on; be sure and have leaves on
the top; while packing add a couple of roots of horse radish. Some wrap
each cucumber in grape leaves, and claim it keeps them more solid and
makes them much nicer. After they are all carefully packed then make a
brine which will bear an egg, then add as much water as you have brine,
to each gallon add one quart of strong vinegar, weight them down, but
not too heavy. Remove all the scum which arises.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

CHILI SAUCE (Very nice).--One quart onions, two quarts cabbage, two
quarts tomatoes, green, two quarts cucumbers, two quarts mangoes, one
quart celery. Soak the tomatoes over night in salt water, run all the
vegetables through food chopper and scald all together in clear water
ten minutes then drain this water off. Mix one half cup flour, one and
one half cups sugar, ten cents worth of mustard seeds, five cents worth
of turmeric powder, five cents worth of celery seeds, two quarts
vinegar. Pour over all and boil fifteen minutes. This has to be put in
sealed jars.--Mrs. Southard.

brown sugar in one pint of vinegar; add two pounds of Sultana raisins,
washed, picked and dried and four ounces of garlic pounded with
vinegar; four ounces of green ginger; two ounces of red pepper and four
ounces of salt. Mix well together with more vinegar if too thick. Keep

occasionally with a wooden spoon. Bottle on the next day.

ORIENTAL CHUTNEY.--Peel and core three pounds of tart apples. Mix with
a pound of stoned tamarinds, three quarters of a pound of seeded
raisins, a head of garlic, two pods of red pepper, and one ounce of
grated ginger roots. Pound all together until reduced to a pulp. Add to
the mixture a pint of brown sugar and a tablespoon each of currant
jelly and thick tomato catsup. Blend well with a wooden spoon. Put in
small jars and seal. This chutney improves with age and is most
pungent.

EAST INDIA CHUTNEY.--Into three pints vinegar put a bag containing two
ounces of ground mustard, four ounces of mustard seed, one ounce of
cayenne pepper and one quarter ounce of turmeric. Add a pound of brown
sugar and scant half pound of salt. Chop together thirteen large ripe
apples, one pound of seeded raisins, seven large ripe tomatoes, four
small onions and two cloves of garlic. Mince fine. Boil in the vinegar
mixture for two hours. Press through a colander and bottle while hot.

America, though it is found on all well supplied English tables. Four
pounds green gooseberries (not too ripe), one half ounce cayenne
pepper, two ounces garlic, two ounces dried ginger, three pounds loaf
sugar, two ounces mustard seed, two scant quarts best vinegar. Put the
berries, when picked over, into a preserving kettle with one quart of

slice them, slice four lemons without removing the skins, put to this
quantity six pounds of granulated sugar, and boil until transparent,
and the syrup thick.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

OIL PICKLES.--(Sliced). Slice but do not pare medium sized cucumbers,
sufficient to fill a gallon jar. Sprinkle one half cup of salt through
the sliced cucumbers and stand in cool place two or three hours, then
drain from the salt. Use one ounce black mustard seed, one ounce white
mustard seed, one ounce celery seed, or one cup of finely minced
celery, one half pint of olive oil, two onions chopped fine. Spread the
cucumbers in the jar in layers sprinkling the seeds over them and
spreading with part of the olive oil repeating the layers until the jar
is filled, then cover all with cold, strained vinegar. Cover and set
aside for future use.--Contributed.

wash and pack in fruit jars as tightly as you can. Add one cup of salt,
one cup of sugar, an ounce of mixed white and black mustard seed, an
ounce of whole cloves and cinnamon bark mixed or any spices preferred
and alum the size of a walnut to one gallon of vinegar. Bring to a good
boil, then turn over the pickles in the jars and seal. A piece of horse
radish root is nice placed in each jar.--Contributed.

WATER MELON PICKLES.--Peel and cut the water melon rind into small
cubes and boil it until tender and clear in water to cover, with alum
the size of a pea. Drain and boil again in a syrup made of one pint of

CANNED CURRANT JUICE.--Express juice from currants by mashing through
colander. Mix one pound of sugar with each pint of juice. Cook five
minutes and seal. Use one tablespoon of canned juice to a glass of ice
water and fill with crushed ice. Raspberry, strawberry and cherry
juices may be canned likewise using a little less sugar.

SPICED GOOSEBERRIES.--Six quarts of gooseberries, four and one half
quarts sugar. Boil one hour, add one pint vinegar and one tablespoon
each of cloves, cinnamon and allspice. Boil three minutes then seal.

pulp and pressing pulp through a colander to extract seeds, then mixing
it with the skins. Boil with four and one half pounds of sugar and one
teaspoon each of cloves, cinnamon and allspice. Boil twenty minutes or
to a soft jam.

SPICED CURRANTS.--To four quarts of ripe currants, add three and one
half pounds brown sugar, one pint vinegar and one tablespoon each of

SPICED GOOSEBERRIES AND SPICED CURRANTS.--Make a syrup of three pounds
of sugar and one pint of vinegar, add steamed gooseberries (about six
pounds) and when cooked thick add one tablespoon of cinnamon and one
half tablespoon of cloves and allspice. For spiced currants substitute
fresh red currants freed from stems but cook only until the currants
are tender as too much boiling makes them hard and tough. Boil the
syrup quite thick before adding the currants and then bring to a boil
and simmer five minutes.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CAKE.--Cream the butter and sugar,
usually beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately, mix the yolks
with the butter and sugar, add the milk, sift the baking powder with
the flour and stir in a little at a time then the whites of the eggs,
then the flavoring. For cakes containing no butter beat the egg yolks
until very light and thick. Add the sugar gradually beating until very
light and spongy. Add flavoring and liquid. Have the whites beaten to a
stiff froth adding them alternately with the sifted flour (mixed with
the baking powder or cream of tartar) and cut both in very lightly.

GOLD CAKE.--Yolks of eight eggs, one and one fourth cups granulated
sugar, three fourths cup butter, three fourths cup water, two and one
half cups flour, two heaping teaspoons baking powder, one half teaspoon
of lemon extract. Sift flour and measure, add baking powder and sift
three times. Cream butter and sugar until light and creamy, add yolks
beaten light and beat well together, then add water and flavoring and
the flour. Beat hard. Bake in greased tin or in layers. Loaf cakes are
nicer baked in a funnel cake pan.--Mrs. Fred Southard.

DELICATE CAKE.--One half cup of butter creamed with one cup of sugar
until very light, add one half cupful of milk and one and one half cups
of flour sifted with one teaspoon of baking powder. Lastly add the
flavoring and stiffly beaten whites of four eggs. Bake in one sheet or
in two layers and ice with brown carmel or white frosting. Nice for
small family. For large layer cake double the recipe.--Mrs. Whitehead.

LULA'S WHITE CAKE.--One and one half cups of sugar creamed with one
half cup butter until very light, add one cup of milk alternately with
three cups of sifted flour. (Sift flour four times). Whites of six eggs
beaten very stiff. When partly beaten add two even teaspoons of cream
of tartar to the eggs. Dissolve one even teaspoon of soda in one
tablespoon of the milk and add it with the milk. Cut in the beaten
whites of eggs last, as you do for sponge cake. Flavor with lemon,
vanilla or almond extract as preferred. Bake in a greased funnel tin.
Bake twenty minutes in a moderately warm oven, then increase the heat
and bake to fifty minutes or until done. Ice with boiled
frosting.--Mrs. Whitehead.

GOLD CAKE.--One cup of butter, one and one half cups of sugar, eight
yolks of eggs, three cupfuls of pastry flour, one teaspoon of baking
powder, one teaspoon of lemon flavor. Cream butter and sugar, add the
well whipped yolks, then the flour with baking powder and lastly the
flavor. Two cupfuls of common flour with one cup of corn starch may be
used instead of pastry flour.--Mrs. George Bruegger.

NO EGG CAKE.--One and one half cups of sugar, one quarter cup of
butter, one cup of sour cream, two cups of chopped raisins, one
teaspoon cinnamon, one half teaspoon cloves, one half teaspoon nutmeg,
one tablespoon grated chocolate, one teaspoon of soda dissolved in hot
water, four cups of flour. Mix spices and chocolate into flour, and add
to the above, and add raisins dredged in flour. Bake one hour.--Mrs.
George Bruegger.

MAHOGANY CAKE.--One half cupful chocolate cooked in one half cup of
sweet milk, one and one half cups of sugar, one half cup of butter, two
and one half cups of flour, one half cup sweet milk, three eggs, level
teaspoon of soda, dissolved in milk. Bake in layers.--Mrs. Wolpert.

SWEET CREAM CAKE.--One large egg, beaten very light, one cup sugar
beaten with egg till light as cream, one cup thick, sweet cream, one
half spoon salt, one and one half cups flour, one teaspoonful baking
powder. Flavor with lemon. Beat continuously while mixing. Bake either
in layers or as a loaf cake.--M. E. Cooper.

SILVER OR GOLD CAKE.--Three fourths cup butter, one and one half cups
sugar, one half cup cold water, with one half teaspoon of soda
dissolved in it, two and one half large cups of flour sifted with one
level teaspoon of cream of tartar (or use two level teaspoons of baking
powder and omit the soda and cream of tartar) and lastly the flavoring
and stiffly beaten whites of eight eggs. Cream butter and sugar until
light and smooth, add water but do not stir, then beat in the flour and
beat five minutes. Cut in the whites and bake in a greased funnel loaf
cake tin in a moderate oven forty minutes or until done when tested
with a broom straw. For gold cake add the beaten yolks of eight eggs to
the creamed butter and sugar and omit the whites and use scant measure
of flour. Ice the gold cake with white boiled frosting.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

CORN STARCH CAKE.--Two cups sugar, one cup butter, one cup of sweet
milk, two cups flour, one cup corn starch, whites of seven eggs, one
and one half teaspoons of baking powder. Flavor.--Contributed.

Makes two rolls.--Contributed.

BREAD CAKE.--Three cups bread sponge, one cup lard or butter, one pound
raisins, two cups sugar, two eggs, one teaspoon soda in a little water,
nutmeg and spices. Mix, raise until light and bake in one loaf.

MOCHA CAKE.--Bake a sponge cake mixture in two round layer cake pans
and spread smoothly between the layers and on the outside with Mocha
cream. Wash one half cup of butter, then beat to a cream and add slowly
enough thick syrup to sweeten. Make syrup as follows: Cook together one
cup of sugar and one half cup of clear, strong coffee until a thick
syrup is formed; cool before using. (New and delicious.)

MOCHA ICING.--One quarter pound chopped almonds, blanched, put in oven
to dry, one half cup of butter, eight tablespoons of icing sugar, one
tablespoon of brandy or whisky; mix butter and sugar to a paste, then
add almonds and whisky.

PARIS STICKS.--Three cupfuls of chopped almonds, two and one half
cupfuls of pulverized sugar, the whites of five eggs beaten to a stiff
froth, the grated rind of two lemons. Mix the ingredients and roll out
on pulverized sugar, cut into strips an inch wide and put into
paraffined pans. Bake in a slow oven. Excellent.

SUNSHINE CAKE.--Whites of seven eggs, yolks of five eggs, one third
teaspoon cream of tartar, one cup sugar, one cup of flour, a little
salt and vanilla. Beat whites stiff, add salt and cream of tartar, add
sugar, then beaten yolks, then flour which has been sifted several
times. Flavor and bake in a funnel tin.--Contributed.

MOCK ANGEL FOOD.--One cup sweet milk, bring to boiling point, one cup
flour, one cup sugar, three teaspoons of baking powder. Sift dry
ingredients together four times, add warm milk and stir well then fold
in beaten whites of two eggs. Flavor. Bake in angel cake
tins.--Contributed.

ANGEL CAKE.--Whites of twelve eggs--or, measured, one and one quarter
cups of whites of eggs. Add one third of a teaspoonful of salt, and
beat until stiff. Sift into this 1-1/4 cups of granulated sugar, and
beat. Have at hand one cup of flour that you have sifted five times;
sift this in and mix one teaspoonful of extract of bitter almonds, or
any preferred flavor. Bake in slow oven, and do not grease your pan.
With a gas stove one young friend puts the grate in the oven in its
lowest sliding place and bakes her angel cake there, lighting both
burners for one minute. Then she turns the front out and the other so
low that it looks like a row of blue beads. She bakes it one hour.
Another, equally successful, puts her grate a little higher than the
middle of the oven, and bakes the cake there for one half hour with a
very moderate oven.

MOCHA CAKE.--One cupful of sugar, one cupful of flour and one teaspoon
of cream of tartar and one half teaspoon of soda sifted all together
twice, blend in one large teaspoon of melted butter and break in the
eggs and stir well, then add one half cup of boiling milk. Bake in one
loaf in a moderate oven.

MOCHA FILLING.--One cupful of powdered sugar, a small piece of butter,
two tablespoons of coffee, two teaspoons of vanilla. Cream butter and
sugar, add coffee and flavoring gradually and a little more sugar if
necessary. Spread with a knife dipped in hot water.--Contributed.

MARSHMALLOW FILLING.--One cupful of brown sugar, one cupful of white
sugar, one cupful water and one tablespoon of vinegar boiled together
like candy. Beat two eggs very light and stir into the candy with one
quarter pound of marshmallows, cut up. Spread on layers of
cake.--Contributed.

DEVIL'S FOOD.--Two eggs, one cup sugar, one half cup butter, two thirds
cup sweet milk, one teaspoon vanilla, one half cup melted chocolate,
one half teaspoon soda, one teaspoon baking powder, two scant cups of
flour.--Mrs. Creaser.

DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE.--One egg, one cup sugar, half cup sour milk, one
tablespoon butter, one fourth cup boiling water, 1 teaspoon soda, one
and one half squares chocolate and one cup flour. (Can use sour cream
instead of milk and butter.) Cream eggs and sugar. Melt chocolate over
hot water and add butter to melt it, then add eggs and sugar. Dissolve
soda in water.--Mrs. G. A. McIntosh.

BOISE BROWN CAKE.--One and one half cups sugar, three fourths cup
butter, four eggs, three fourths cup grated chocolate, one cup milk,
one cup chopped nuts, two cups flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one
teaspoon vanilla, one teaspoon cloves, one teaspoon cinnamon, one
teaspoon allspice, one half teaspoon salt.--Mrs. D. E. Plier.

MASHED POTATO CAKE.--Two cups sugar, three quarters cup butter, one cup
mashed potatoes, four eggs, one cup chocolate, one half cup sweet milk,
one teaspoonful cloves, one teaspoonful vanilla, one cup chopped
walnut, two cups flour, two teaspoons baking powder.--Mrs. F.
Kleinsorge.

CHOCOLATE LOAF CAKE.--One half cake of chocolate shaved in a bowl or
three fourths cup of cocoa. Pour one cup of boiling water on this
mixture and let it stand while you are mixing the cake. Cream three
fourths cup of butter with two cups of sugar until light. It is best to
cream the butter first and add sugar gradually especially if the butter
is hard and cold. Beat in yolks of two eggs, one half cup of sour milk
or butter milk, one teaspoon of soda dissolved in a little water,
(about two tablespoonfuls,) two cups of flour sifted, and beaten whites
of two eggs. Beat well, then add the chocolate. Bake in one sheet in a
dripping pan lined with greased paper. Let the cake stand in the pan.
Ice with boiled frosting and when firm and cold, cover with one square
of chocolate that has been melted in one teaspoon of butter in a cup
placed in a pan of hot water for five minutes. Pour the chocolate over
the white frosting and spread evenly with a silver knife. Cut the cake
diagonally across the pan into two inch diamond shaped pieces. A cupful
of floured chopped nuts may be added to the cake batter before baking,
if nut loaf is liked, and sometimes I place a half English walnut in
the center of the frosting on each diamond. This chocolate and white
frosting is also nice with white layer cake and chopped nuts make it
extra nice for a thick filling to a square two layer cake, shaking the
nuts over the white frosting and then baking them with the
chocolate.--Mrs. Whitehead.

SPONGE CAKE.--Beat four eggs and one cupful of granulated sugar until
mixture is creamy white. Add four tablespoons of cold water and one cup
of flour sifted several times with a teaspoonful of baking powder. Bake
in a moderate oven. Flavor with lemon. May be baked in layers.--Mrs. H.
Hanson.

SPONGE CAKE.--Six eggs, (reserve whites of two for frosting), two cups
sugar. Beat (not stir) eggs and sugar until almost cream colored, two
and one half cups flour, one teaspoon flavoring, and one teaspoon
baking powder last, one cup boiling water, the water must be added
gradually. While adding flour and water stir instead of beating. Bake
in loaf in a moderate oven thirty or forty minutes.--Mrs. C. C.
Mackenroth.

HOT WATER SPONGE CAKES.--Four eggs beaten 15 minutes, two scant cups
sugar, 2 cups sifted flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, two thirds cup
boiling water, flavor with lemon or vanilla. Bake in a deep square
tin.--Mrs. Southard.

BOILED SPONGE CAKE.--Five eggs, one cup white sugar, one cup flour,
juice of one half lemon, one teaspoon vanilla. Boil the sugar with
three tablespoons water until it threads. Pour over the stiffly beaten
whites of eggs, beat this fifteen minutes, then add egg yolks,
flavoring and the flour sifted three times. Bake in angel food
tin.--Mrs. Aaron J. Bessie.

GOLD SPONGE CAKE.--Whites of eleven eggs beaten very stiff, yolks of
four eggs beaten very light with one and one half cups of powdered
sugar. Cut in the whites and add one cup of swans down flour sifted
with one teaspoonful of baking powder. Flavor. Cut flour in lightly as
you would for sponge cake. Bake in one loaf.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

SNOW SPONGE CAKE WITH COCOANUT FILLING.--Beat the whites of ten eggs
very light, add one and one half cupfuls of powdered sugar and beat
until the bowl can be inverted and retain the eggs. Add one teaspoon
cream tartar to one cupful of flour and sift several times. Cut this
into the egg mixture, flavor with almond extract and turn into square
ungreased cake tins, baking in two sheets. Fill with cocoanut frosting
made by boiling two cupfuls of sugar with water until it hairs from the
spoon, turn it hot on to the beaten whites of two eggs and whip to a
frosting. Add one small cocoanut which has been freed from the shell
and all brown skin and grated fine. Flavor with lemon or vanilla. If
fresh cocoanut cannot be obtained try soaking the shredded cocoanut in
warm milk and steaming it an hour or two before using and then squeeze
it dry. This will make it more moist. If you have only one angel cake
tin, split the cake through the center after it is cold and put the
icing between the layers. Swans down flour is best for this cake and
the fresh cocoanut make a delicious filling.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

SUNSHINE CAKE.--Whites of ten eggs, yolks of six, one level teaspoonful
of cream of tartar, one and one half cupfuls of sugar, sifted, one
cupful of flour, sifted twice, the grated peel of one orange or one
teaspoonful of lemon or vanilla or one half teaspoon of almond extract.
Beat whites very stiff, then beat in one half of the sugar, beat yolks
light about ten minutes, add the flavoring and balance of the sugar and
beat five minutes. Mix yolks and whites lightly together and cut in the
flour that has been sifted with the cream of tartar. Bake in an
ungreased, funnel angel cake tin about an hour in a slow oven or 45
minutes in a moderate oven. Avoid baking too long as it makes the cake
dry and coarse. When the cake shrinks from the tin at sides of the pan
it is sufficiently baked. Invert the tin and let it stand until cold.
If it sticks then run a knife around the edge of cake, pat the tin
slightly on the bottom and sides until it drops from the pan. If a
frosted cake is preferred ice it with white boiled icing.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

MOCHA CAKE.--One cup sugar, one half cup butter, three quarters cup
milk, two cups flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one spoon vanilla,
three eggs beaten separately. Bake in small dripping pan. When cold cut
into small squares. Put into oven to brown. Three cups shelled peanuts,
pour over three teaspoons melted butter. When slightly browned put
through meat grinder. Whip one half pound butter with two cups powdered
sugar to a cream. Butter each piece of cake with this cream paste and
roll into ground nuts.--Mrs. A. McKay.

milk, one and one half cups sifted flour, one cup chopped walnuts or

square tin about half an inch thick. Chop one fourth pound almonds, mix
with sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on top of cake before putting in
the oven. Bake about thirty minutes.--Mrs. J. Bruegger. German Cookery.

SOUR CREAM NUT CAKE.--Break two eggs into a large cup and fill with
sour cream. Put in a mixing bowl and add a level teaspoonful of soda
and one cupful of sugar, beat all well add flour to make quite stiff

thick with flour about three and one half cups. Bake in one loaf. Cut

alternately with the flour and beaten whites of eggs. Mix well and
lastly add the brandy. Bake in one large loaf very slowly. Test with a
broom straw to be sure that the cake is well baked. The batter will
seem thin but do not add extra flour if you want a rich moist fruit
cake. Put in cake box and it will keep many months. Pieces of it can be
quickly steamed and used with foam sauce as plum pudding for dessert in
an emergency which is sometimes worth the price of the cake.--Mrs. B.

GOOD PLAIN GINGER BREAD--One cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, one cup
of boiling water, two level teaspoons of soda dissolved in the hot
water, one half cupful (generous) of butter or shortening, one large
teaspoon of ginger and a little salt. Add enough flour to make pretty
stiff, about three cups. Bake in moderate oven in one sheet. As
molasses cake of any kind burns easily care should be taken not to have
the oven too hot. Eat warm for luncheon. Is nice sliced cold and served
with whipped cream as a dessert also.--Mrs. Whitehead.

WALNUT FILLING FOR CAKE.--One pound chopped walnut meats, yolks of six
eggs, two cups sugar, one cup sour cream, flavor with vanilla. Boil in

and add one half package of raisins and two tablespoons of
frosting.--Mrs. John Heffernan.

BOILED FROSTING.--Two cups of sugar boiled with water till it threads
from spoon. Beat whites of two eggs very stiff. Pour the thick hot
syrup gradually into the whites, beating continually until light and
thick. Flavor to suit taste. For chocolate frosting add one third cake
of Bakers chocolate cut or shaved fine, while the frosting is warm
enough to melt it. For tutti-fruitti filling add mixed chopped nuts,
raisins, figs, dates or crystalized fruits to two thirds of the
frosting, reserving the balance for icing the top of cake. For cocoanut
cake, spread the layers with frosting and sprinkle thickly with grated
cocoanut. Marsh mallows may be steamed, mixed with nuts, and served
through the frosting too.--Mrs. Whitehead.

WHITE CARAMEL OR FONDANT FROSTING.--Two cups of sugar, boiled with one
and three fourths cups of milk or thin cream to the soft ball stage.
Test it by dropping a spoonful in cold water. If you can pick it up in
a soft ball take the carmel from the stove. Add one tablespoon of
(uncolored) butter and one teaspoon of vanilla and beat steadily until
it creams or turns to a fondant. Spread immediately on the cake.
Chopped nuts are nice added to this or halved English walnuts may be
placed regularly on top of a square cake. Chocolate may be added to the
warm fondant before beating it. White icing like this is nice covered
with thin layer of chocolate melted with butter or English walnuts
buried in the white icing and then covered with chocolate fondant makes
a delicious filling for layer cake. This caramel filling with nuts is
especially nice on Devil's Food or dark chocolate. Brown sugar caramel
is made likewise using half granulated and half brown sugar for the
fondant.--Mrs. Whitehead.

MARSHMALLOW FILLING OR ICING FOR ANGEL FOOD CAKE.--Steam one pound of
marsh mallows with one pint of milk, and beat into this half a pint of
whipped cream and one half cup chopped nuts. Flavor with vanilla and
spread between layers of Angel Food or sponge cake. May cover this
filling with melted chocolate icing, also if liked.--Contributed.

Pastry, Pies and Tarts

    "Cook your husband what he likes, and save a hundred household
    strikes."


PIE CRUST.--For one pie, mix one large cup of flour sifted with half a
teaspoon of salt, with one half cup of lard and butter mixed. Blend
these ingredients thoroughly with the hands or cut and shape with a
knife, then lightly mix in one quarter cup ice cold water, just enough
to bind the flour and lard together. Use scant measure of water and do
not handle much. Flour the molding board and quickly roll half the
dough into a thin crust and line the pie tin. Fill the pie with
prepared fruit, wet the edges of the crust with water, roll out the
balance of the dough for the upper crust, gash it across the center and
lift it carefully and cover the pie, pressing edges together with a
fork. If a glazed crust is wanted rub the crust over with a little
milk, egg and sugar slightly mixed together. This insures a nice brown
crust. The oven should be hot enough to turn white note paper a nice,
rich brown color in five minutes time. Pastry requires a brisk oven but
not too hot. The ingredients for pastry should be very cold. The
measure of shortening (lard) should be generous and the water scant and
it should not be handled after the water is added only sufficient to
lift out of the mixing bowl and roll out. Flour the board well and
flour the rolling pin.

CURRANT PIE.--One cup currants (fresh fruit), one cup sugar, one
tablespoon flour, two tablespoons water, one lump of butter and yolks
of two eggs. Beat all together and bake in one crust. When done frost
with the beaten whites of the eggs.--Mrs. Davidson.

CHERRY PIE.--Line a pie plate with pie crust, fill it generously half
full of fresh, stoned sour cherries, and sprinkle a generous cupful of
sugar over them mixed with one large tablespoon of flour, dot with one
level tablespoon of butter cut into bits, cover with another layer of
cherries sprinkled lightly with sugar. Cover with an upper crust
wetting the edges and pressing well together to prevent juice escaping.
Cut a gash in center of top crust to allow steam to escape and bake in
a moderate oven for forty minutes or until cherries are tender and the
juice bubbles in a simp. If a novice at the work, test the fruit with a
broom straw through the gash in the upper crust. If the straw can
pierce the fruit easily the pie is done.--Mrs. Whitehead.

FRESH FRUIT PIES.--The recipe for cherry pie applies to all fresh berry
or fruit pies gauging the sugar and flour according to the juicy
sweetness of the fruit. Gooseberries, currants, strawberries,
cranberries and plums will take good full measures of sugar and flour.
Raspberries, blue berries and black berries require less sugar and
apricots and peaches and apples small measures of flour. A little
butter improves the flavor of all fruit pies and apple pie needs a
dusting of nutmeg or cinnamon before adding the top crust. Canned fruit
may be drained free of its syrup and used the same way using less sugar
and adding half a cupful of the syrup.--L. W. W.

LEMON PIE. Crust.--One half large cup of flour, one heaping tablespoon
of lard, pinch of salt. Mix well. Add enough water to make paste. Roll
thin, put in tin, prick with fork and bake. Filling. One large cup of
sugar, two heaping tablespoons of flour, one large cup of boiling
water, butter the size of a walnut, juice and grated rind of one lemon,
yolks of two eggs. Mix the flour and sugar together, add boiling water,
put on the stove and let come to a boil, then add butter, yolks of two
eggs, juice and grated rind of one lemon. Remove from fire at once.
Beat the whites of two eggs with two tablespoons of sugar and put on
top. Put in oven to brown.--Mrs. R. Meidell.

AMERICAN PRUNE PIE.--Stew about twenty four or thirty prunes, pitt and
sweeten the prunes. Bake a pie crust. Whip one half pint of cream,
sweeten with sugar, flavor with vanilla. Put a layer of prunes in the
crust, then the whipped cream on top and serve cold.--Mrs. R. Meidell.

PUMPKIN PIE.--One cupful of mashed pumpkin, three quarters cup of
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one half teaspoonful each of mace,
cinnamon and ginger. Heat one teacupful of milk and beat three eggs and
add to mixture. Bake with under crust only.--Mrs. H. Hanson.

PUMPKIN PIE.--One quart milk, three cups stewed pumpkin, one tablespoon
flour, four eggs, one and one half cups brown sugar, one half cup
molasses, one teaspoon salt, one level tablespoon cinnamon, one
teaspoon ginger, one tablespoon melted butter. Bake with an under
crust. Makes three pies. Beat eggs, add pumpkin, then flour, sugar,
salt, spices, molasses and butter and lastly the milk which may be
partly cream. Mix well, fill pie tins which have been lined with pie
crust and bake from thirty to forty minutes.--L. W. W.

RHUBARB PIE.--One cup diced fresh rhubarb, one cup sugar, one
tablespoon flour. Mix all together, turn into a pie tin lined with pie
crust. Dot bits of butter over the top of rhubarb, sprinkle with one
tablespoon of water. Cover with top crust and bake in moderate oven
about forty minutes.--Contributed.

CREAM PIE.--Two yolks of eggs beaten with one half cup sugar, add one
large tablespoon of flour and a scant tablespoon of corn starch
dissolved in a little milk. Cook in one pint of boiling milk on back of
range, stirring constantly. Flavor with vanilla or lemon. Fill baked
pastry shell, cover with meringue and brown in oven. Serve cold.--L. W.
W.

CUSTARD PIES.--The rule for custard pie is four beaten eggs and one
scant cup sugar to each quart of milk. For one small pie use half this
recipe. Mix all together and add flavoring of vanilla, lemon, almond or
nutmeg. Line deep pie tin with pie crust and fill with the raw custard
and bake in a moderate oven until the custard sets and can be cut clean
with a silver knife. Do not bake too long or it will be dry and tough
and use scant sugar measure to avoid a watery custard. Cocoanut custard
pie is made by adding one cup of shredded cocoanut before baking. Date
pie is made by pressing stewed dates through a colander and adding to
the custard. Open fruit custard pies are made by laying a layer of
prepared fruit on the crust in the tin and covering with the raw
custard. All custard pies are baked with an under crust only. Pumpkin,
squash and sweet potato pies are made by adding a quart of the cooked
and mashed vegetable to each quart of custard and adding spices and
salt to suit individual taste.--Contributed.

CREAM PIES.--The cream fillings are cooked on top of stove until thick.
Line pie tins with a rich pie crust, pick with a fork to let out air
while baking, and bake a golden brown, then fill with the cooked
filling, cover with a meringue and bake until meringue sets. The rule
for the cream filling is two eggs beaten with half a cup of sugar and
one large tablespoon of flour or one scant tablespoon of cornstarch
mixed smooth with a little milk, add flavoring. Bring two small cups of
milk or water to a boil, add the egg mixture and cook thick. If liked
add one teaspoon of butter to the milk or water. For chocolate pie
double the sugar and use two squares of chocolate shaved fine and heat
with the cream filling. For pineapple add grated pineapple to the cream
filling, double the measure of flour as acids thin the mixture
considerably. For lemon cream pie use the juice and grated rind of one
large lemon or two small ones and double the flour and sugar measure.
(For orange pie use juice of one large orange and half a lemon.) In
lemon and orange pie water is generally used in preference to milk and
if a rich pie is liked use an extra egg yolk and a large measure of
sugar.--Contributed.

MERINGUE.--To make the meringue, beat the whites of two eggs very light
and stiff, cut in two level tablespoons of sugar and beat five minutes.
Spread on top of the filled pie, sprinkle lightly with sugar and brown
in a slow oven. When meringue is firm to the touch it is done and will
not fall or shrink, if under-done it falls. If the oven is too hot
leave the oven door open for three minutes before putting the meringue
in to bake. Long beating of the whites of eggs and sugar however will
usually make a good, thick and firm meringue.--Contributed.

ENGLISH ORANGE CHEESE CAKES OR TARTS.--One half pound sugar (one cup)
mixed with one fourth pound butter (one half cup) add three eggs,
(reserving white of one); juice of two oranges and grated rind of one;
juice of one lemon. Beat well. Simmer until like honey. Fill baked
patty or tart shells of pie crust. Make a meringue of the stiffly
beaten white of egg and one tablespoon of sugar. Frost the tarts,
sprinkle with sugar and brown in a moderate oven. Serve cold.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE.--One and one half cups of sugar, creamed with one
half cup butter, yolks of three eggs, one half cup milk, one square
chocolate melted in half cup boiling water, two cups flour sifted with
two heaping teaspoons baking powder. Add vanilla and the unbeaten
whites of the three eggs the last thing.--Mrs. T. B. Huff.

BURNT SUGAR CAKE.--One and one half cups sugar creamed with one half
cup butter, yolks of three eggs, one large cup cold water, three large
tablespoons of thick burnt sugar or enough to make a light brown in
color; two cups flour sifted with two heaping teaspoons baking powder.
Add the unbeaten whites of the three eggs and vanilla the last thing.
Frost with boiled frosting to which has been added one tablespoon of
burnt sugar and a half cup broken nut meats.--Mrs. T. B. Huff.

TO MAKE BURNT SUGAR.--Put in a sauce pan one cup sugar and cook,
stirring constantly; the sugar will then form into lumps, then melt and
throw off a thick black smoke. Now take from fire and add three
tablespoons hot water and place on stove and let come to a good boil;
it is then ready to use and can be kept indefinitely.--Mrs. T. B. Huff.

CHOCOLATE FROSTING.--To make a good chocolate frosting make a quantity
of fudge, beating it until very smooth and until it sets. Then add a
teaspoon, or the necessary amount of cream, or milk, until the right
consistency to spread.--Mrs. T. B. Huff.

BAKED FISH.--Large white fish, pike or cat fish are best, but small
fish can also be used. Put in a pan, sprinkle well with salt and pepper
and cover with bits of butter; then pour a little water or milk in the
pan and bake, basting the fish often, and adding more water or milk as
needed. This takes about a half hour to bake in a hot oven. Make a
white gravy of milk, butter and flour, season well and add a can of
mushroom and serve over the fish. Delicious.--Mrs. T. B. Huff.

COCOANUT CHEESE CAKES OR TARTS.--Boil one pint of sugar with two thirds
of a pint of water and add one and one half cups of shredded cocoanut
and boil slowly twelve minutes; remove to rear of range and while warm
beat in one half cup of butter until smooth; then beat in the beaten
yolks of five or six eggs. Flavor with lemon juice or vanilla or almond
extract. Line patty pans or gem tins with a rich pastry crust, fill
with the cocoanut custard and bake. They are pretty capped with a cube
of currant jelly. Serve either hot or cold.

APPLE CHEESE CAKES.--One pint of steamed, sweetened and stewed apple
sauce heated. Add grated rind of half a lemon, two level tablespoons of
butter and beat smooth, then cut in two eggs beaten well. Bake in patty
pans lined with pastry. Good way to use left over pie crust and apple
sauce.

MINCE MEAT.--Four pounds of lean boiled meat, chopped fine; twice its
weight in sour apples, peeled, cored and chopped fine, one pound of
minced suet; three pounds of seeded raisins, two pounds of currants;
one pound of brown sugar; one pint of molasses and of maple syrup or of
fruit syrup, two quarts of sweet fresh cider, one pint of cider boiled,
one tablespoon of salt, one scant teaspoon of pepper, one tablespoon
each of mace, allspice and cloves, four tablespoons of cinnamon. Mix
well and bring to a boil on the stove. When nearly cold stir in one
pint of brandy and one pint of wine. If these are not liked use syrup
from pickles or pears or unfermented grape juice. Pack in a large stone
crock or seal in Mason jars and keep covered in a cool place. Will keep
good all winter. Half of this recipe will suffice for the winter for a
small family. Considering that the mince meats put up in cartons and
packages contain no meat and often an inferior grade of dried apples,
it certainly pays to make mince meat at home out of fresh material,
when butchering is done and apples are cheapest.--Mrs. Whitehead.

MINCE MEAT. (Small jar for small family.) Two cups chopped boiled meat,
or of hamburger steak, steamed tender in a double boiler, four cups of
chopped apples, one pint of sweet cider or of juice from pickled
peaches, one cup molasses, two cups sugar (scant), juice of three
lemons, one cup shredded or chopped suet or one half cupful of butter
or sweet drippings, one teaspoon of salt, mixed spices to suit taste.
Cook five minutes. When ready for pie thin the mixture with cider or
with a glass of tart jelly melted and add seeded raisins or currants
and a little brandy if liked. Bake between two crusts of pastry and
serve warm. One heaping cup of mince meat will make one pie. Fruit
juice left from canned fruit is nice added to mince meat and often can
be nicely utilized this way.

NEOPOLITANS.--Take pie crust left over after mixing pie. Roll it into a
thin sheet and cut into oblong strips three by two inches. Bake in
quick oven. Spread half with jam, lay balance of strips over that like
sandwiches and spread jam or jelly on top. Dust with powdered sugar.
Lemon or orange cake filling or frosting may be used instead of juice
or marmolade, and crushed fresh, sweetened berries make a good filling
and covering if capped with whipped cream.

ENGLISH CHEESE PIE.--One cupful of thick sour cream or milk curd,
salted slightly, two beaten eggs, three fourths cup of sweet milk, one
half cup sugar, one half cupful of English currants (dried). Rub curd

lined with pie crust. Powder with cinnamon.

FRENCH TART.--Pound eight macaroons fine, pour boiling milk over them
to make a soft batter, add six well beaten eggs and one half cupful of
sugar. Cook thick, add one half cup of butter and the juice of an
orange. Line a pie with pastry, fill with the mixture and bake. Dust
with powdered sugar before serving. Eight good sized macaroons will
take from two to three cups of milk.

PATTIES.--Three cups flour, one cup lard, three fourths cup of ice
water, one teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon salt. Mix and roll like
pie crust. Bake in patty pans. Makes thirty patties.

PIE CRUST.--One and one quarter cups flour, pinch baking powder, mix
with one half cup lard and one teaspoon salt. Add ice cold water enough
to roll out--about one fourth cup. Flour board and roll thin.

BERRY TARTS.--One pint of buttered strawberries or red raspberries, one
cup sugar, the beaten white of one egg stirred through the sugar. Mix
with the berries. Bake between two crusts until egg is set then serve
with whipped cream.--Contributed.

and cook to a thick syrup. Four eggs beaten with one half cup sugar,
add one quart milk and a little vanilla. Pour the syrup in the bottom
of custard cups, turn in the custard and bake, set in a pan of boiling
water. As soon as the custard will cut clean with a knife it is done.
Too much sugar and too much cooking makes custard "watery."--Mrs.
Whitehead.

ORANGE AND BANANA COMPOTE.--For six bananas a little underripe make a
syrup of one cup of sugar and a half cup of water. Flavor with six
whole cloves and one inch stick cinnamon. Boil eight minutes without
stirring. Add the bananas and simmer until they begin to clear. Put in
the juice of two oranges, a half lemon and a half glass of grape juice.
Remove the cloves and cinnamon and serve on rounds of toast or sponge
cake with whipped cream.

one half cup milk, one and one third cups flour, one and one half
teaspoons baking powder, flavoring. About one hour before serving slice
six bananas, add one and one half cups sugar, juice of two lemons, four
tablespoons water. Stir three times. When ready to serve put between
layers, add chopped walnuts and heap whipped cream over all.--Mrs. D.
E. Plier.

CREAM PUFFS.--One half cup melted butter, one cup hot water, cup flour,
stir the flour into the water and butter while boiling. It will not
lump. Let stand until cold, then stir in separately with a fork three
eggs not beaten. Bake in greased gem pans or drop in greased pans and

beaten cream sweetened and flavored.--Contributed.

STRAWBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM.--Scald one cupful of milk or thin cream,
pour it slowly over one egg yolk slightly beaten with one quarter
cupful of sugar, return to double boiler, add one half tablespoonful of
granulated gelatine dissolved in one quarter cupful of cold water; stir
until mixture coats the spoon, strain at once into a bowl. When cool
and beginning to show signs of stiffening beat in one half cupful of
strawberries which have been mashed and sweetened with a tablespoonful
of sugar, then fold in the stiffly beaten white of an egg and finally
one half cupful of cream, whipped very stiff. Fill wet molds and leave
on ice three hours. Serve with or without whipped cream.

STRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE.--Whip one cupful of cream very stiff. Beat the
white of one large egg or two small ones very stiff. Beat into the
white one half cupful of fine sugar. Combine this with the whipped
cream, then lightly stir in one cupful of strawberries cut in quarters.
Spoon into a mold lined with lady fingers or slices of sponge cake and
place on ice for one hour.

ANOTHER STRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE.--Mash one cupful of strawberries and
sweeten according to the acidity of the berry. Let stand to draw the
juice, an hour, then strain. Dissolve one level tablespoonful of
granulated gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Set the bowl
containing it in a pan of hot water and stir until smooth, add it to
the strained strawberry. Now whip one cupful of cream, sweetened with
two level tablespoonfuls of sugar, lightly fold the strawberry gelatine
in, a few drops at a time. Turn into a wet mold and put on ice for two
hours. If carefully mixed there will be no settling at the bottom. The
mold for this need not be lined with cake, but a delicate wafer of some
sort, preferably vanilla, should be served with it if it is molded
plain.

LEMON JELLY.--Soak one box Knox sparkling gelatine in one pint cold
water, two minutes; add two pints boiling water, one and one half cups
sugar, and stir until dissolved; add juice of three lemons, strain
through jelly bag into molds.

with sugar and grated chocolate and a little salt, five minutes; then
add dissolved gelatine, stirring constantly; flavor with vanilla, and
pour into mold; serve with whipped cream.

PINEAPPLE JELLY.--Read this recipe carefully and follow instructions.
Soak one box Knox gelatine in one pint cold water, set on stove in
double boiler to dissolve; when gelatine is cold and beginning to set,
beat into it pineapple juice and pineapple, and place on ice to harden.
Be sure you follow the above, for if you mix pineapple and its syrup
with gelatine when you first make it, the acid in it will digest the
gelatine so it will not harden.

WINE JELLY.--Soak one box Knox sparkling gelatine in one half pint cold
water two minutes, add one quart boiling water, one and one half cups
sugar, and stir until dissolved; add one half pint wine and juice of
two lemons; strain and pour into mold.

NUT CREAMS.--Soak two large tablespoons of gelatine in one half cup
milk. Set in hot water until melted, but do not heat. Whip one pint
cream, reserving a cupful after it is whipped. Turn the gelatine into
the cream adding one half teaspoonful of sugar, the beaten white of an
egg, a teaspoon of vanilla and a large cup of chopped hickory and
walnuts. Whip until stiff. Mold in small cups that have been wet with
cold water. When ready to serve turn on a flat dish, put on remainder
of whipped cream and sprinkle with chopped nuts.--Mrs. Alleman.

MAPLE CREAM GELATINE.--One half package Knox gelatine dissolved in one
cup cold water; one cup maple syrup heated to boiling point, mix with
gelatine, strain through a cloth and cool. Beat one pint of cream, mix
in and add one cup nuts.--Mrs. Schollander.

BROD TORTE.--One cupful of rye breadcrumbs, eight eggs, a cupful of
granulated sugar, one quarter pound of almonds, sliced or ground, (I
prefer them sliced), one quarter pound of citron, sliced thin; one half
ounce of bitter chocolate (grated), a lemon, juice and rind; one
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, one half teaspoonful of cloves, a
wineglassful of brandy. Dry the bread in the oven and put through food
grinder or sifter. Mix almonds, citron, chocolate and spices with the
crumbs. Beat the yolks of the eggs with the sugar until thick; add
lemon juice and heat again. Mix the dry ingredients with beaten eggs
and sugar; next put in the brandy and, lastly, the whites of four eggs
beaten stiff, are folded into the mixture. (Reserve the other four for
the meringue. Pour into a "spring form" and bake in a moderate oven.
When the "torte" is done, spread jelly on the top and the meringue made
with the reserved eggs upon the jelly. Put back into the oven until the
meringue is lightly colored.

GERMAN PAN CAKES FOR DESSERT OR LUNCH.--Beat yolks of six eggs and then
beat whites of three to a stiff froth. Mix with three fourths cup
grated bread crumbs, one cup cream and a large cupful of flour, pour in
a buttered sauce pan, sprinkle with sugar and stir over the fire until
thick then fry in butter, on a hot skillett, like pan cakes. Put on a
hot dish, sift powdered sugar on them and sprinkle with lemon juice and
serve hot.--Contributed.

FRUIT TRIFLE.--Beat whites of six eggs light, add six tablespoons of
sugar and beat about half an hour then beat in one cupful of grated
pineapple or cut up fresh strawberries or fresh raspberries or cut up
fresh, ripe peaches or apricots or any fruit jam or jelly and beat five
minutes. Serve ice cold in sherbet glasses as it is or chopped with
flavored whipped cream. "Trifle" is sometimes made by using whipped
cream, sweetened, and adding one cupful of cut up fresh berries, or
peaches or orange pulp or bananas chopped, or half a glass of any
fruit, jam or any jelly cut into small pieces. Beat it through the
whipped cream. This is a simple and palatable dessert which can be
quickly made.--Mrs. Whitehead.

JUNKET.--One quart of warm milk, two tablespoons brandy; wine or
vanilla; two tablespoons sugar, one junket tablet or one tablespoon of
rennet. Stir well together, then let it stand undisturbed until thick,
then place on ice. Serve with sugar, nutmeg and cream. This is another
dainty and easily made dessert.--Mrs. Whitehead.




Ice Cream, Sherbets, Ices and Frozen Dainties

    "Which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot
    weather."--Shakespeare.


ICE CREAM.--In packing the freezer use rock salt and crush the ice very
fine. Put it in a heavy grain sack and pound and mash until nearly as
fine as snow. Measure ice and salt allowing four parts ice to one of
salt or ten pounds of ice to three of salt. Pack ice in layers three
inches deep, then shake over one large saucerful of salt, then another
three inch layer of ice and more salt, alternating ice and salt until
you reach top of can. Pack the can with cream, put on the top of
freezer, and let cream stand until it freezes on edges, then turn the
dasher slowly for ten minutes, then quickly until cream is frozen thick
but not too hard. Remove the dasher, put on the top and cork, repack
freezer with ice, cover with heavy carpet and let cream ripen two or
three hours.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

ICE CREAM.--Without cooking. Two quarts of thick cream, two cups sugar.
Mix and stand until sugar dissolves. Flavor to suit taste and
freeze.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

CARAMEL ICE CREAM.--Beat three eggs, one cup sugar and one half cup of
flour together and cook with one pint rich milk. Brown one cupful of
granulated sugar to a caramel and add to this hot custard. Cool and add
one quart thick cream. Freeze.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.--Let one large pint of milk come to a boil, add
one cup of sugar and one third cup of flour mixed with the beaten yolks
of three eggs; three fourths cake of sweet chocolate. Cook until thick
and creamy, stirring constantly. Cool and add one quart of cream, one
cup sugar and pinch of salt. Add vanilla flavoring and freeze. When
partly frozen add the beaten whites of the eggs and freeze until firm
but not too hard. Pack freezer well, cover and let it ripen two or
three hours if possible.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

MARYLAND ICE.--Two quarts ripe strawberries mashed with four cups
sugar. Stand one hour and squeeze out the juice through a sieve or
cheese cloth. Add two quarts of water and freeze. Remove water from
freezer when ice is half frozen, pack, and let it stand twenty minutes.
Then scoop out the center; leave wall intact. Make a filling of one
pint of cream, one half cup sugar, one teaspoon flavoring beaten and
whipped until stiff. Add one half cup of chopped or rolled nuts. Fill
the cavity in the strawberry ice with this mixture. Repack the freezer
and let it ripen four or more hours. When ready to serve, remove
freezer can, wrap it in a cloth dipped in boiling water, let stand one
minute when the mould of ice cream will slip out easily onto the
serving platter. Serve in thick slices.--Mrs. C. H. McKay.

MOUSSE.--(Without cream.) Rub one quart of berries through a sieve, add
one cupful of powdered sugar, one ounce of dissolved gelatine, and the
whites of five eggs beaten stiff. Put in a mold and pack in ice and
salt for three or four hours.--Mrs. C. H. McKay. (Editorial Note.--The
above recipes were demonstrated by Mrs. McKay in her paper on "Ice
Cream, Ices and Frozen Dainties" at Domestic Science club.)

VANILLA ICE CREAM.--One quart thick cream, seven tablespoons of sugar,
one half of a vanilla bean. Cut bean into halves, scrape out seeds and
mix with sugar. Add sugar to half of the cream, and put in the balance
of the bean. Heat and dissolve sugar in hot cream. Remove from fire,
strain and cool. Add remaining cream and freeze. The flavor of the bean
makes delicious ice cream but of course good vanilla extract may be
substituted. Use a tablespoon of extract. Plain ice cream is nice
served with hot chocolate caramel sauce or with maple sauce and chopped
nuts.--Mrs. Whitehead.

CHOCOLATE CARAMEL SAUCE.--One and one half cups brown sugar, one half
cup of milk, four ounces of chocolate. Stir all together on back of
range until chocolate is melted and smooth; then boil until it forms a
soft ball when tried in cold water. Serve hot over the ice cream. Makes
a nice pudding sauce also and is nice on cream puffs or eclairs.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

RED RASPBERRY ICE CREAM.--Follow directions for chocolate ice cream
given above, omitting the chocolate and adding one quart of ripe red
raspberries pressed through a sieve and sweetened, when the cream is
half frozen, and when the meringue is added also. Proceed with the
freezing and ripen two or more hours before serving. Strawberries,
apricots and peaches are equally as good used this way.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

TORTONI ICE CREAM.--Boil one and one half cups sugar with water to
cover until it threads from the spoon. Pour it over the stiffly beaten
whites of three eggs and beat well. Scald one quart of new milk and add
beaten yolks of eggs. Cool and mix with one pint of cream (may be
whipped but isn't necessary) and six crumbled almond macaroons. Flavor
with vanilla or almond extract. Mix all together and freeze. Cocoanut
may be used in place of macaroons but it should be sprinkled with sugar
and slightly browned in the oven first.--Mrs. Whitehead.

MAPLE MOUSSE.--Boil a cupful of maple syrup three minutes and stir into
the beaten yolks of three eggs. Put back in dish syrup was boiled in
and boil two minutes. Cool. Whip a quart of cream and add the cooled
mixture and freeze. Do not stir. In the winter it may be simply set out
of doors, or may be packed in ice and salt.--Mrs. G. A. McIntosh.

CARAMEL PUDDING.--Take one and one third cups of brown sugar and put in
pan on stove and melt, stirring constantly to prevent burning. When
melted add very slowly one third cup of boiling water.--Mrs. G. A.
McIntosh.


Cold Desserts

MAPLE MOUSSE.--Four eggs beaten stiff, one cup of maple syrup. Cook
until it thickens, then beat until cool. Then add one pint of whipped
cream, pack in salt and ice for several hours.

FROZEN RICE PUDDING.--One cup rice, one quart milk, one quarter
teaspoon salt, one cup sugar, one cup cream, one teaspoon flavoring.
Cook rice in milk until soft, add sugar, salt and flavoring and pour

frozen.--Mrs. Schollander.


Fruit, Ices or Sherbets

LEMON SHERBET.--One pound of sugar and one quart of water boiled to
thin syrup and when cool add the grated rind of two lemons and the
juice of six. For a water ice stir it now and then in the freezer and
freeze slowly until like wet snow. For a sherbet freeze quickly until
light and stiff. For a sorbet, add a meringue made of the beaten white
of egg and sugar to the partially frozen ice.

ORANGE SHERBET.--Add the juice of six oranges and grated rind of three
and the juice of one lemon to the above sugar and water syrup and
freeze.

PINEAPPLE SHERBET.--Add one pint of grated pineapple and juice of one
lemon to above syrup and freeze rapidly.

MINT SHERBET.--Pound the leaves of two dozen stalks of mint to a pulp,
add to the syrup as above with the juice of two lemons and freeze or
use mint extract.

GRAPE SHERBET.--Add the juice of one lemon and a pint of grape juice to
the above syrup and freeze.

BERRY SHERBET.--Add one pint of the berry juice and juice of two lemons
to above syrup and freeze.

CRANBERRY SHERBET.--One pint of strained and sweetened cooked cranberry
juice and the juice of two lemons added to above syrup and freeze
stiff. Fruit jellies may be melted and strained and used as substitutes
for the fresh fruit juice.

FROZEN STRAWBERRIES.--Mash one quart of berries, add one and one half
cups sugar and the juice of one lemon. Let it stand one hour, then add
one pint of water and freeze like ice cream. Serve in punch glasses
with whipped cream. Peaches and apricots are also nice frozen likewise
as are cooked cranberries pressed through a colander.

FRAPPE.--This is strictly speaking of drink partially frozen until like
wet snow. Grape Frappe is frozen coffee and lemon Frappe is partly
frozen lemonade. A punch is merely a cold fruit drink with a block of
ice floating in it. It is usually made of a combination of fruit juices
sweetened and wines and liquors are frequently added to it.

PARFAIT AND MOUSSE.--This is frozen whipped cream, sweetened and
flavored to suit the taste. It is packed in a mould and buried in
crushed ice and salt for several hours. The cream should be frozen one
and one half inches deep. The center remains soft. The opening of the
mould should be bound with a strip of muslin dipped in melted suet or
butter. Quick parfait is made by adding whipped cream to ice cream. At
serving time beat in the whipped cream. Coffee ice cream with whipped
cream is much liked, as are chocolate and caramel ice cream served this
way. Macaroon mousse is made by adding crushed and rolled macaroons to
whipped cream and burying the mould in ice and salt. Chopped nuts are
used the same way and crushed fruit.

LEMON ICE.--Two and three fourths cups sugar, two tablespoons corn
starch; add one quart boiling water. When cool add juice of eight
lemons and when half frozen add whites of three eggs and one pint thick
cream.--Mrs. D. E. Plier.

CURRANT ICE.--One pint currant juice (or two glasses of currant jelly),
two lemons and one orange, three cups sugar, two quarts water. Pour
juices over sugar and stir until dissolved then add water and freeze.
The whites of two eggs may be added just before the freezing is
completed.--Mrs. Schollander.

PINEAPPLE SHERBET.--One quart of granulated sugar, and one quart cold
water brought to a boil. Pour over one quart can of grated pineapple
and juice of six lemons. Strain and put into freezer. When cold add
whites of three eggs beaten stiff with one tablespoon of sugar.
Freeze.--Mrs. W. S. Davidson.

PISTACHO MOUSSE.--Whip a pint of cream very stiff, beat into it lightly
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; flavor to taste with pistacho
extract and stir in one half cupful of chopped nuts. Last of all color
a delicate green with vegetable coloring mixture. Turn all cream into a
mould and pack with ice and salt for four hours.--Mrs. J. D. Wolpert.

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.--Three cupfuls of cream and one of milk, or one
quart of thin cream, three quarters of a cupful of sugar; scald, but do
not boil. Beat until cold, add one cupful of strawberries mashed with
their juice and one half cupful of sugar. Place in freezer, pack in ice
and salt, using three quarters ice and one quarter salt, and freeze
until as stiff as can be turned. Remove dasher, work up and down with a
long handled spoon to pack solidly and set aside for twenty minutes or
longer. Serve garnished with a half cupful of strawberries cut in two.
For individual servings a simple way is to pack the ice cream in pound
or half pound baking powder tins after it has been frozen and bury it
in ice and salt. It then may be turned out and sliced in rounds, one
round to a person, and the strawberries used to decorate each service.
Of course, if this is done the cream must be very firm and should be
packed at least two hours before it is used. To avoid much melting the
bucket may be put in the ice box in a tin pan.

STRAWBERRY MOUSSE.--Dissolve one tablespoonful of granulated gelatine
in one quarter cupful of water by placing the bowl containing it in a
pan of hot water; when smooth add three quarters of a cupful of
powdered sugar and stir until cool. Strain gradually into two cupfuls
of cream whipped very stiff, add one cupful of fresh strawberries which
have been chopped fine with a silver knife and sugared with one third
cupful of sugar. Have the mould already packed in ice and salt, put the
mousse into it by the spoonful, first being sure that all the
ingredients are well mixed; cover with buttered paper, put on the lid
of one mould and pile ice and salt on top. Put in a cold place for two
to four hours. Unmold and serve with halved strawberries and sponge
cake or angels food.

ORANGE WATER ICE.--Juice of six oranges, two teaspoons extract of
orange, juice of one lemon, one quart water, one pound powdered sugar,
one gill rich, sweet cream, add all together and strain. Freeze same as
ice cream.--Mrs. H. J. Liddell.

Eggs

    "Twelve studies in white and gold,
    Oh, egg, within thy oval shell,
    What palate tickling joys do dwell."


STUFFED EGGS.--Cook eggs twenty minutes just below boiling point.
Remove shells, cut in half lengthwise. Take out yolks and mash them.
Add one half quantity finely minced ham or chicken, moisten with one
tablespoon of butter softened and seasoned with salt, pepper and
mustard. Fill whites with this mixture and press halves together. Roll
in fine bread crumbs, then into beaten egg and again in crumbs. Fry
brown in very hot fat. Serve garnished with parsley.--Mrs. H. C.
Windel.

EGGS LYONNAISE.--Boil eight eggs twenty minutes and throw in cold water
and remove shells. Separate yolks and whites and chop whites fine. Put
whole yolks in a dish over boiling water to keep warm. Peel and chop
two medium sized onions and fry golden brown in two tablespoons of
butter. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and add a cupful of white
sauce. Stir gently to boiling point, then add chopped whites and cook
two minutes. Pour over hot whole yolks, sprinkle with minced parsley
and serve.--Mrs. H. C. Windel.

HAM AND EGG ON TOAST.--A good way to use small pieces of left over ham
or other cooked meat is to chop them fine. Toast several slices of
bread and lay on a platter. Beat three eggs slightly, pour in a little
milk, cook over the fire a few minutes, but not till it is thick, stir
in the chopped meat and pour over the toast.--Mrs. Geo. Farries.

ONION EGGS.--Boil six eggs hard, slice three of the eggs, cut three
onions in slices, fry in butter, lay them on a platter; place the
sliced eggs over them, cover to keep hot, grate the other three eggs,
season with salt and pepper, boil up in a little cream and pour over
the eggs and onions.--Mrs. Geo. Farries.

SHIRRED EGG.--Grease a shallow pan and break eggs carefully into it.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and heat with butter. Steam or bake until
the whites are set and serve. Shirred eggs are usually served in the
individual dishes they are baked in. A little minced parsley is often
sprinkled over the top of each plate.

LAYER EGGS.--Fry two onions, sliced thin until they are tender and
brown. Cut hard boiled eggs into slices. Add half a bowl of good gravy
to the hot onions and then the eggs. Season with salt and pepper and
serve.

SCRAMBLED EGG.--(New.) Break eight fresh eggs into a saucepan, add a
piece of butter the size of an egg, eight tablespoons of cream; two
tablespoons of soup stock, one scant teaspoon of salt and a little
pepper. Set over the fire and stir until the eggs begin to thicken then
remove from the fire and beat with a Dover beater until they are light
and delicate. Heat over the fire again and serve in a warm dish. Very
nice for breakfast and lunch.

CREAM TOAST WITH EGG.--Heat a quart of milk; toast slices of bread,
butter them and dip each into the milk a second. Lay in a deep serving
dish. Now add a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of salt to the hot
milk. Beat the yolk of an egg, adding gradually a small tablespoon of
flour and two tablespoons of cold milk. Stir into the boiling milk and
cook until creamy, then pour it over and around the toast and serve
immediately. May be served with poached eggs, too.

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS.--Beat six eggs a trifle with two
tablespoons of cream and scramble in hot pan. Season and stir in the
tips of a bunch of stewed asparagus. Add a dash of pepper and serve on
toast.

EGGS, NEW YORK STYLE.--Boil six eggs half an hour. Drop them into cold
water; shell and quarter them and lay them in a buttered baking dish.
Make a white sauce of one pint of hot milk with butter, and flour
enough to thicken. Season and stir until smooth. Chop two large boiled
onions, add to the sauce and pour over the eggs, sprinkle the top with
cracker crumbs, dots of butter and two tablespoons of grated cheese.
Bake until a nice brown and serve immediately.

CREOLE EGGS.--Poach eggs in deep, boiling salted water and serve with a
highly seasoned tomato sauce.

CREAMED EGGS.--Poach eggs and serve with a thickened, seasoned cream
sauce or a browned gravy sauce, mushrooms, asparagus tips, minced
parsley or minced cold boiled ham, cauliflower, green corn, oysters,
sausage or dried beef may be added to any cream sauce and served over
poached eggs or hard boiled eggs, cut into slices or quartered. Or any
of these sauces may be spread on an omelet, folded over and served.

CHEESE AND EGGS ON TOAST.--Beat three eggs with three tablespoons of
bread crumbs, soaked soft in milk and drained. Add three tablespoons of
melted butter, one teaspoon of mustard, salt and pepper and lastly one
half pound of grated cheese. Spread evenly on slices of toast and brown
quickly in the oven.

EGGS AND POTATOES.--Fry diced cold boiled or baked potatoes brown in a
butter, seasoning with salt and pepper; break in three or four eggs and
scramble lightly. Add two tablespoons of thick cream and serve
immediately.

SWISS EGGS.--Line a pie plate with thin slices of cheese. Mix a cup of
milk with one teaspoon of mustard, a dash of cayenne and a little salt.
Pour half of this mixture over the cheese. Then break carefully five
eggs on the cheese; pour over the rest of the milk and bake until the
eggs are set. The cheese will melt and thicken the milk.

HONEYCOMB EGGS.--Set a granite pan with a tablespoon of butter in the
oven to heat. Beat five eggs with one third cup of milk and salt and
pepper exactly one minute. Pour into the hot pan and bake in a quick
oven until eggs rise to the top. Serve immediately.

OMELET, NEWPORT STYLE.--Soak a pint of bread crumbs in one pint of
milk. Beat eight eggs very light and stir with the crumbs, beating five
minutes. Heat two tablespoons of butter in a pan, pour in the mixture,
season with salt and pepper and stir and scramble the mixture quickly
with the point of a knife, tossing it lightly. Cook about three minutes
and serve on toast.

PLAIN OMELET.--Separate four eggs. Beat the yolks with half a cup of
milk or water, season with salt and pepper. Beat the whites in a bowl
very light or until the bowl can be inverted and retain the whites of
eggs. Cut the whites into the yolks and turn into a hot frying pan with
melted butter. Let it stand over the fire undisturbed until it is
nicely browned on the bottom. Then run the pan into a hot oven and
brown on top. Serve immediately with or without sauce. Vegetable omelet
is made by spreading hot thickened creamed vegetables over the omelet
just before serving. Asparagus omelet is excellent. Fruit omelets are
made by spreading with stewed fruit or jelly or crushed sweetened fresh
fruit like strawberries, raspberries or peaches, or jams made of these
fruits. Fruit omelets are spread with powdered sugar usually. Rice,
macaroni or hominy are often seasoned in a favorite way with cheese or
gravy and spread on the omelet before serving. Macaroni cooked with
tomatoes and cheese makes an excellent omelet filling. Thickened,
stewed tomatoes are nice, and mushrooms may be added with green peas to
the tomatoes for Spanish omelet. In fact there are a thousand good
combinations and there isn't a nicer way to use a small portion of any
left over than to use it for an omelet filling if it will harmonize
with eggs at all. Four eggs in an omelet combination of this kind will
do nicely for a meal for a family of six people.--Contributed.

BREAD OMELET.--Soak one half cup of bread crumbs in one half cup of
milk. Separate four eggs, beat separately. Beat bread crumbs into the
yolks, add salt and pepper, beat whites till stiff. Add them to yolks
stirring with a spoon and pour into a hot spider at once. Cook on top
of stove till the bottom is browned then place in the oven till it is
cooked through.--Mrs. Creaser.

HAM OR MEAT OMELETS.--Soak one cupful of bread crumbs in one cup of
milk; add one cupful of minced cold boiled ham, veal, beef, corned
beef, tongue, fish or chicken; season with salt and pepper. Beat two
eggs very light, stir in lightly. Turn into a buttered hot frying pan,
brown on the bottom well, then run the pan into a hot oven and brown on
top. Or they may be fried in deep lard by dipping a spoonful of the
mixture into the smoking hot grease.--Contributed.

CODFISH OMELET.--Cook one tablespoon of flour with one of butter, add
one half cup hot milk. Add one cup of shredded codfish that has been
parboiled until tender, and drained. Add two cups cold boiled potatoes
that have been chopped fine. Mix well. Brown butter in a hot frying
pan, turn in the mixture, brown on the bottom, then fold over and
serve.--Contributed.

BAKED EGGS.--Break eight eggs into a well buttered dish; salt and
pepper them, add bits of butter and four tablespoons of cream; cover
top with grated cheese. Bake about twenty minutes.--Contributed.

EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.--Break one cupful of mushrooms into small
pieces, dredge them with flour and put them into the saucepan with
three tablespoonfuls of butter, a few drops of onion juice, salt and
paprika. Cook for ten minutes. Beat three eggs slightly, not separating
them, and season them with salt and pepper. Add them to the mushrooms
and scrape them from the bottom as they cook until the mixture is thick
and creamy. Serve on hot buttered toast.

Canned Fruit, Preserves, Jelly and Wines

    "Preserving the sweetness of proportion and expressing itself
    beyond expression."--Ben Jonson.


CANNED BERRIES.--Fill the glass cans with the cleaned berries as full
as you can crowd them in the jars. Make a syrup of sugar and water,
allowing a pint of sugar to each pint of water for the sour berries and
a quarter less sugar for the sweet fruits. Boil to a medium thick
syrup. Fill the cans of fruit with this syrup and seal, but not air
tight. (Put the tops lightly on). Stand the jars in a large dish pan or
preserving kettle half filled with boiling water. Cover and let the
water boil for twenty minutes, then remove the jars and seal as tight
as possible. Invert the cans and let them stand over night then place
cans each in a paper bag to exclude the light and pack in a cool dry
place. It is better to use wash boiler if much fruit is canned at a
time and a cloth should be laid on the bottom of the boiler to prevent
breaking of the cans. Fruit canned this way retains its shape, color
and flavor. Strawberries, cherries, red or black raspberries, black
berries, currants, gooseberries, huckleberries, grapes and plums are
best canned by this method. If peaches, pineapple, apricots, pears and
crab apples are canned this way they should cook twenty minutes longer
to assure tender fruit. They are perhaps more satisfactory cooked in a
thick syrup in an open kettle and then canned, as they are not soft
enough to lose their shape and it is more convenient to test them and
judge as to tenderness and flavor.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

BERRY JAM.--Weight the cleaned berries and take an equal weight of
sugar for the sour fruit and crush and beat together until well mixed
in the preserving kettle, then boil steadily and gently over the fire
until thick, stirring frequently. Gooseberries should be boiled in
water to cover until the skins break, then add the sugar slowly and
cook half an hour. Currants should be cooked only long enough to let
the fruit get tender, as the juice jellies easily anyway, and the
currants get hard and tough if cooked too long. Red raspberries are
nice combined with currant juice and sugar.--Mrs. Whitehead.

MARMALADES.--Marmalade differs from jam because the fruit is cooked in
water to cover and when soft and tender is pressed through a colander
or sieve. Then the sugar is added and the pulp is cooked to a smooth,
thick consistency over a steady fire, stirring often to prevent the
fruit from sticking to the kettle. The fruit is weighed before cooking
and an equal weight of sugar is used. Fruit "butters" are thick
marmalades but they are usually not sweetened as much as marmalades and
are cooked longer. Sour fruits like cherries, gooseberries, plums,
peach and apples make the best "butters." Black berries, oranges,
apricots, grapes, peaches and pears make the best marmalades. The hard
seeds of blackberries and grapes are nicely disposed of in marmalade
and yet the pulp and fine flavor of the fruit is retained. Cook them as
long as you would jelly.--Mrs. Whitehead.

CURRANT JELLY.--Wash the currants, steam them and fill a large
preserving kettle with two pints of water added. Wash the fruit and
boil five minutes. Strain through a jelly bag and measure the juice,
allowing a pint of sugar to each pint of juice. Put the juice over the
fire and boil steadily twenty minutes. Warm the sugar in the oven, add
it to the boiling juice and stir well. Boil three minutes. Try a little
on a saucer. If it "jells," pour into jelly glasses, placing a silver
spoon in each to prevent cracking the glass. Set in the sun until it is
firm, then cover with melted paraffine. Another method is to boil the
strained juice ten minutes, then add the sugar and boil ten more
minutes. This makes a stiff, firm jelly but the first method makes more
delicate jelly. Make grape jelly the same as currant, using green
grapes if possible. Grapes must be fresh and not over ripe or they will
not "jell" nicely.--Mrs. Whitehead.

RASPBERRY JELLY.--Select red raspberries that are firm and if possible,
not quite ripe. Set them over a slow fire after crushing them with a
potato masher. Boil five minutes, then strain through a jelly bag and
measure. Use the same measure of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen minutes,
add the sugar and boil five minutes. Or to each three pints of
raspberry juice add one pint of currant juice and proceed as for
currant jelly. Strawberries are used the same as raspberries, selecting
firm, solid fruit that is practically ripened, if possible. It may also
be combined with apple juice instead of currant juice, if liked.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

CRAB APPLE JELLY.--Wash and quarter fresh, firm crab-apples and cover
with water allowing one quart of water to each pound of fruit. Cover
the kettle and boil twenty minutes. Drain in jelly bag over night.
Allow half a pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil juice ten
minutes, add warm sugar, boil up once and try the jelly, which should
jelly instantly.--Mrs. Whitehead.

WILD PLUM JELLY.--Sprinkle the washed plums with a little soda; cover
with boiling water and stand ten minutes; then drain and cover with
fresh boiling water and cook thoroughly, to a mush. Squeeze through a
jelly bag and proceed as in making currant jelly. Cultivated plums are
cooked in a little water until soft and tender and then strained in a
jelly bag and used like currants. Many colors are possible from the
different varieties of plums and as many fine flavors.

FANCY JELLIES.--Three pints of pineapple juice to one pint of apple
juice and an equal measure of sugar makes nice pineapple jelly. A rose
geranium leaf in each glass of apple jelly is liked by many. A
delicious mint flavor may be given to apple jelly by lining the bottom
of a jelly glass with mint leaves or the juice may be flavored with
essence of mint or winter green before it is boiled with the sugar.
Even red peppers are boiled in their own juice by chopping them and
placing them in a double boiler and cooking until all of the juice is
extracted. Allow an equal measure of sugar and boil until it thickens
and put in small glasses, and serve with cold meats. The seeds of two
vanilla beans added to twelve pounds of apples made into jelly, just
before turning the jelly into the tumblers makes a delicious jelly for
cake fillings and desserts. Rhubarb, apricots and quinces are sometimes
used for jelly but are difficult to make unless combined with other
fruits rich in pectose like currants and apples.

PLUM CONSERVE.--Two baskets of blue plums, six large oranges. Use the
peeling of two. Two pounds of seeded raisins chopped. Use one half
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil one hour, stirring
constantly.--Mrs. Creaser.

CARROT MARMALADE.--Boil carrots with their skins on. When cooked remove
skins and put carrots through a sausage grinder. Take equal amounts by
weight of sugar and carrot pulp and boil again. Flavor with sliced
lemons and almond extract. Chopped nuts may also be added.--Mrs. H.
Hanson.

QUINCE HONEY.--Grate four large quinces in one quart of cold water. Add
two pounds granulated sugar and boil until thick as jam.--Mrs. W. C.
McGuiness.

QUINCE HONEY.--To five pounds granulated sugar, add sufficient water to
make a syrup, thick enough for pancake syrup. Pare six large quinces
and grate them. After the syrup has thoroughly boiled add the grated
quinces and boil all together until it becomes a reddish color, when it
is ready to be put into jars for use.--M. E. Cooper.

MRS. ALLEMAN'S PINEAPPLE CONSERVE.--Two pounds of pineapple, four
pounds of rhubarb, grind together and add twice as much sugar as you
have fruit. Boil slowly until thick then put in jelly glasses. Good
with game and cold meats.--Contributed.

GREEN TOMATO MARMALADE.--Peel and cut in small pieces six cups of green
tomatoes, add two lemons, use the outside yellow, but remove the inside
white skin and cut the pulp up in small pieces, add six cups of white
sugar and cook until thick.

GINGER PEARS.--Pare and core large juicy pears and cut in small
sections. To each quart of the fruit, use one pint of sugar, one piece
of ginger root, one stick of cinnamon and one half of a lemon cut in
small pieces. Cook very slowly until the pear is clear and the mixture
like marmalade.--Mrs. Schollander.

GOOSEBERRY MARMALADE.--One pound of ripe gooseberries, one half pound
of sugar, the shredded peel of one lemon or a stick of cinnamon. Weigh,
wash, drain and mash ripe gooseberries. Press through a sieve. Boil the
sugar with one half cupful of water and the spice to a syrup; add the
sifted gooseberry and cook to a thick marmalade, stirring almost
continually. Put up hot in air tight glasses.

ORANGE MARMALADE.--Remove the seeds from--but do not peel--twelve large
or fifteen small oranges and six lemons. Cut both into thin slices.
Pour three quarts of cold water over them and let stand for forty eight
hours. Put into a preserving kettle and cook slowly until tender. Add
six pounds of sugar; if desired very sweet, add more, and cook until
the consistency of ordinary marmalade.

ORANGE AND HONEY MARMALADE.--Peel the oranges, removing every particle
of white pith. Cut small; to one quart of this pulp and juice add one
pound of honey and one quarter pound of the thin yellow peel of the
orange. Cut the peel into tiny bits, cover with half a pint of water
and boil until tender; add to the pulp and honey, and cook together for
half an hour, stirring frequently. Pour into small glasses and when
perfectly cold, cover with paraffin.--Contributed.

ORANGE HONEY.--Remove the peel from oranges, and cut into small
pieces with a pair of scissors; wash and soak for twenty four hours,
then chop fine, and turn into a preserve kettle, using one cupful of
sugar, and one cupful of water for every cupful of peel. Boil all
together until it is a soft, thick mixture like honey, then bottle in
screw top jars. Serve on hot biscuits or rolls, or use like ordinary
honey.--Contributed.

BAR DE LUC CURRANTS.--Take selected red (or white) currants of large
size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin one fourth of
an inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with
a sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of
the fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when
hot, add the currants. Let simmer a minute or two, then seal as jelly.
The currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in
the mouth. Should the currant liquify the honey too much, carefully
skim them out, reduce the syrup at a gentle simmer to desired
consistency and store as before after adding the fruit.--Contributed.

SWEET PICKLE OF PINEAPPLE.--Peel a pineapple, removing the eyes. Tear
the fruit from the core with a silver fork. For six pounds of fruit
boil together a pint of vinegar and three pounds of sugar. Put into
the vinegar a bag containing two level teaspoons each of powdered
cinnamon and mace, half a teaspoon of cloves and a piece of green
ginger root about a half inch long. When scalding pour over the
fruit, which should be in a large crock or earthen dish. Let all
stand for twenty four hours, drain off the syrup, bring it to the
boiling point and pour over the fruit. Repeat for two more successive
days, then seal.--Contributed.

SUN PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.--Select ripe, clean, perfect fruit. It
spoils the fruit to wash it; if, however, this is necessary, put about
one quart of berries in a wire basket or colander; put them carefully
down in a pan of cold water; move the basket gently just a moment; lift
and drain; then stem the berries. Weigh, and to each pound allow one
pound of sugar. Select large stoneware or granite platters; heat them
quite hot; cover with half an inch sugar, a layer of strawberries, and
the remaining sugar over the top of the berries. Stand the platters in
a "cold frame", or cover them with glass and stand them in the hot sun.
As soon as the sun becomes too cool bring them in; don't lift the
covers, but stand them aside until morning. Next morning put them out
in the hot sun again. By this time the berries should be soft and
transparent, but perfectly whole and of a brilliant color. Lift each
berry carefully with a fork; put it in the tumbler; fill all the
necessary tumblers and cover them for a moment with glass. Put the
syrup over the fire and boil rapidly until it is sufficiently reduced
just to cover the fruit; pour it over the fruit while it is hot;
protect the tumblers and stand them aside to cool. When cold put over
the top of each a tablespoonful of melted paraffin; cover the tops of
the tumblers with two thicknesses of tissue paper and fasten firmly
around the edge with library paste. When the paper is thoroughly dry
brush it with cold water. In drying the paper will tighten and form an
exceedingly good covering.--Contributed.

APPLE BUTTER.--Boil cider down to two thirds its original quantity, and
turn into this as many peeled and sliced apples as the liquid will
cover. Simmer, stirring often until soft and broken. Strain out the
cooked apples, add more fresh ones and cook in the same way. Do this
until the cider is absorbed. Set all aside in a stone crock for twelve
hours, then boil to a soft brown mass and pack in stone
jars.--Contributed.

CANNED WHOLE GOOSEBERRIES.--Take stem and blossom ends from large firm
gooseberries. Fill fruit can with them, cover with boiling water, let
stand until following day; drain, add boiling water again repeating for
three days in succession. Then fill with boiling water and seal. When
ready to use cook and sweeten. Fine for winter pies.

SUNNED CURRANTS.--Cover large red, stemmed currants with granulated
sugar; spread on a platter and stand over night. Cover with a pane of
glass and stand in the sun three days in succession. Seal in jelly
glasses. Use equal weights of sugar and fruit. Same recipe is nice with
red raspberries and with large, firm strawberries. The juice jellies
around the fruit which retains its shape and rich color.

CANNED GRAPE JUICE.--Stem, wash and drain concord grapes, cook until
soft; strain through jelly bag. Add a pint of sugar to each gallon of
juice. Cook only until sugar is dissolved and seal.

PEACH PRESERVES.--Use four cups of sugar to each quart of peeled
peaches. Make a thick syrup of the sugar and water. Pour hot over fruit
and stand over night. Drain syrup and boil thick again. Drop in peaches
and cook tender. Pack them in jars, covering with the syrup.

CHOKE CHERRY AND CRAB APPLE JELLY.--Cover choke cherries with water and
stew until soft. Strain through jelly bag. Prepare crab apples
likewise. Use twice as much apple juice as cherry. Mix and boil twenty
five minutes. Add one cup sugar to each cup juice and boil ten minutes
more.

SUN PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.--Wash and stem berries. Take an equal
weight of sugar, add a very little water and dissolve. When boiling add
the berries. Let come to a boil and cook three minutes. Pour into
platters or shallow dishes and set in the sun until thick. Three days
will suffice if the weather is clear. If the dishes are covered with
glass the fruit cooks more quickly. When thick put in tumblers, cover
with paraffin and put in a dark place.

CONSERVES.--One quart of rhubarb (do not peel), one pint of red
raspberries, one pint red currants, one pound raisins, one pound
English walnuts, two oranges (sliced very thin), two lemons (sliced
very thin); a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook until thick as
jelly. Put in jelly glasses and cover with paraffin. (Delicious.)

APPLE BUTTER.--Fill a preserve kettle with peeled, cored and sliced
apples. Add a slight flavoring of cloves, allspice and cinnamon. Cover
with fresh, sweet cider and boil slowly, stirring frequently until the
whole becomes a dark brown jam with only juice enough to keep it soft
and buttery. Remove from fire and place in covered jars or seal. Do
not use for several weeks. Good spread for bread for children. Select
firm apples that cook to a soft, smooth apple sauce. Bell-flowers,
Greenings, Baldwin or Maiden Blush apples make good apple butter.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

CURRANT COMPOTE.--Pick nice large red currants from stems after washing
well. Put one half of them into a preserve kettle. Press juice out of
remaining half; add enough sugar to make a syrup, heat until sugar is
dissolved. Cool slightly and pour over the currants in preserve kettle.
Bring to a boil and seal in pint jars. The currants will be whole and
taste much like fresh fruit with jellied juice around them.--Mrs.
Whitehead.


Wines

    "A cup of wine sir?
    A cup of wine that's brisk and fine."--Shakespeare.

GRAPE WINE.--For five gallons of wine use twelve and one half pounds of
concord grapes, twelve and one half pounds of wild grapes, twelve and
one half pounds sugar. Wash the grapes then pick from stems and put in
stone jars and mash; let stand from seven to ten days, then press
through wine press or jelly bag. Add sugar and water enough to fill a
five gallon keg. Put in cool cellar; let bung hole remain open but
cover it with cheese cloth and let grapes ferment; change cloth
frequently and after six weeks cork the keg tightly and let lie until
March, then seal in bottles. May be made from bull berries or other
fruit by same process. Same recipe for choke cherries.--Mrs. J.
Bruegger.

RHUBARB WINE.--Take five pounds of rhubarb and cut into small pieces,
add one gallon of cold water and put in a crock for eight days,
stirring it well two or three times a day, then strain and to every
gallon add four pounds of white sugar, the juice and half the rind of
one lemon. Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in a little of the liquid
and add. Cover it for a month, then strain through a muslin bag and
bottle.--Mrs. Schollander.

CHOKE CHERRY WINE.--To one gallon of fruit allow two gallons of water,
mash fruit to get the juice, let stand nine days, then press through a
fruit press. When the juice is all extracted strain through a cloth. To
each gallon of juice allow three pounds of granulated sugar, or loaf
sugar, let stand several days and when thoroughly mixed, the sugar all
dissolved, strain through flannel bag, into keg or jug, leaving it
uncorked, but should be covered with some perforated cover or cloth to
avoid dirt or flies, or anything to get into the keg. Let this ferment
until it stops, which takes several weeks and be sure to keep it full,
there is always loss when it bubbles over, therefore it is advisable to
reserve a quart of juice to fill up with (plain sugar water will answer
the same purpose). When it ceases to ferment cork tight, (air tight),
let alone until the month of March then draw into bottles, cork tight
and it will be ready for use.--Mrs. George Bruegger.


Salads

FRUIT SALADS.--There is a large variety of dressings considered
appropriate for fruit salads. Boiled frosting is perhaps one of the
most popular foundations with varying flavors of fruit, wine, etc.
Sugar and lemon juice, sugar and fruit juice, boiled custard, plain
whipped cream sweetened and flavored, are all used, as well as a cooked
dressing made in this way: Add to the yolks of four eggs well beaten,
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one half
teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne and four tablespoonfuls of
vinegar. Cook in a double boiler, stir constantly and cook rather
slowly to prevent curdling. Let this get thoroughly cold and just
before serving add one pint of whipped cream unsweetened. Mix well and
pour over the salad.--Contributed.

GOLDEN DRESSING.--Beat two eggs, and a quarter cupful of any light
colored fruit juice, quarter cupful lemon juice, and a quarter cupful
of sugar. Put in a double boiler, stir until thickened, cool and pour
over sliced fruit.--Contributed.

FRUIT SALAD.--For the salad itself all sorts of combinations are
possible. Malaga grapes cut in halves, seeded, and mixed with a third
of the same quantity of shelled pecans in one happy mixture.
Pineapples, oranges and bananas go well together, as also pitted ripe
sour cherries with nuts. Orange, lettuce, lemon, nuts and water cress
are congenial companions, while preserved fruit may be used with fresh
fruit. Prunes are delicious in a salad, stuffing them with nuts or
cheese, covering with mayonnaise. The prunes should be washed, soaked
over night, then cooked until tender before they are pitted. Apricots,
either fresh or canned, sliced ripe pears are two new favorites used
with nuts and served with a nice boiled salad dressing, and garnished
with shredded lettuce.--Contributed.

FROZEN SALAD.--Put into a bowl one cupful orange slices, one cupful
each bananas and pineapple, one cupful of mayonnaise, one cupful cream,
measured before whipping, and a teaspoonful gelatine that has been
softened in cold water, then dissolve over hot water, toss lightly,
place in a mould and freeze. When frozen, cut in slices and serve on
lettuce leaves.--Contributed.

PINEAPPLE SALAD.--Lay one thick slice of canned pineapple on a lettuce
leaf, spread with thick mayonnaise, cap with sweetened whipped cream
and sprinkle with ground pecans or English walnuts.--Mrs. Whitehead.

FRUIT SALAD.--One cup of diced apples, one cup diced pineapple, one cup
diced oranges, one and one half cups bananas, one cup white grapes,
(cut in half), seeds removed, one half cup walnut meats, one half cup
diced celery. Serve with a salad dressing or whipped cream.--Mrs. Aaron
J. Bessie.

MRS. ALLEMAN'S WALDORF SALAD.--One cup each of chopped apples, walnuts
and celery. Dress with following mayonnaise dressing: Mix one half
tablespoon salt, one half tablespoon mustard and three fourths of a
tablespoon of sugar, add one slightly beaten egg, two and one half
tablespoons of melted butter, three fourths of a cup of thin cream and
very slowly one fourth of a cup of vinegar. Cook in double boiler until
thick, then strain and cool.

FRUIT SALAD.--One pound of malaga grapes, washed, cut into halves and
seeded; six large slices of canned pineapple cut into small pieces;
four apples peeled, quartered and cut into small pieces; three bananas
sliced fine; one bunch of celery, cleaned and cut into small dice; one
cupful of chopped pecans or English walnuts. Mix all lightly together
and mix with mayonnaise salad dressing. As all people do not like olive
oil I usually make a boiled dressing as follows: Heat half a cupful of
vinegar with as much hot water and two large spoonfuls of butter. Beat
the yolks of four eggs very light with a scant half a cupful of sugar;
add one level teaspoonful of flour and stir well; add then one
tablespoonful of dry mustard, one teaspoonful of salt and one of celery
salt or celery seed; a dash of black and of red pepper, beat a little;
place over the fire and cook thick, beating well. Cook only a few
moments, then remove from the fire and beat until perfectly smooth.
When ready to use add one cupful of thick whipped cream. Mix with the
prepared fruit. A scant teaspoon of flour added to sugar and egg
mixture prevents curdling of the dressing and saves eggs at a season
when they are scarce while it assures a smooth dressing always. A dash
of sugar added to cream before whipping it will prevent its turning to
butter. Lemon juice sprinkled over the fruit will prevent discoloring
of apples and bananas.--Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.

BANANA SALAD.--Skin bananas and cut into halves. Roll each in chopped
peanuts. Lay on a lettuce leaf and serve with mayonnaise dressing
capped with whipped cream.--Contributed.




Serving Dinner

    "Truth seeks some broader meeting place
    For breed or clan or tribe or race
    For saint and sinner;
    But after all the noise and fuss
    The issue paramount with us
    Is--What for dinner?"--J. W. Foley.


SERVING A FORMAL DINNER.--In cities the usual hour for a dinner party
is seven o'clock; in country places it is frequently earlier in the
day. When the last guest has arrived, dinner is announced. The host
leads the way with the lady whom he wishes to honor and the hostess
comes last with the gentleman whom she wishes to honor. The giving of a
dinner is the most important of all the duties of a hostess. She must
not betray ignorance or show nervousness, for she alone is responsible
for its entire success. The serving maid should be trained to keep cool
and avoid accidents. The number invited and the outlay expended should
depend upon circumstances and one's means. The favorite form of serving
a formal dinner is called a la Russe. The articles of food are carved
by the servants at a side table or in the kitchen and brought to the
guests. This has one advantage; it allows the host and hostess more
time for social enjoyment with their guests. But it calls for well
trained servants to perform this duty satisfactorily. It requires about
one servant to every six guests; therefore, when dinner is served in
this fashion, where the help is inadequate, it is well to engage
outside assistance. For a home like, informal, dinner, where the host
does the carving, one servant can wait upon twelve persons and do it
well if properly trained. On a table or sideboard should be placed the
plates for the various courses, smaller spoons, finger-bowls, coffee
cups and saucers. As the plates from each course are removed, they
should be taken to the kitchen. The waiter should approach the guests
from the left except in serving water, coffee, or anything of a like
nature. The color and flavor of the various courses should be as
different from each other as possible, offering all the foods in their
respective seasons and of the finest quality.

COURSES FOR A FORMAL DINNER.--First course: Oysters, as a rule, should
be served at the beginning of a dinner, though they are used only in
those months of the year in which the letter "r" occurs. The balance of
the year little neck clams are used. The second course consists of a
soup, the clear soup being preferred, accompanied by crackers or bread.
Celery may be served also. The third course consists of fish, boiled or
fried, and should be accompanied by small boiled potatoes; if boiled or
cooked in any fancy manner, serve radishes. Fourth course: An entree is
next in order if desired; it should be made in a fancy way, so as to
avoid carving; bread should be the accompaniment. Relishes, such as
olives, salted almonds, etc., are served with this course. The fifth
course consists of roasts. These may be composed of beef, veal, mutton,
lamb, venison, turkey, duck, goose, or capon, accompanied by one or two
vegetables. Sixth course: Punch or sherbet may be dispensed with or
not, as fancy dictates. The seventh course consists of snipe, prairie
chicken, squabs, etc., but poultry, such as spring chicken, or duck,
may be served instead. Eighth course: Any appetizing salad with cheese
wafers. Ninth course: Hot and cold sweet dishes, consisting of
puddings, ice cream, cakes, etc. Tenth course: Turkish or black coffee
served demi-tasse. The above makes a pleasant menu, but it can be made
simpler or more elaborate as one chooses. Before serving the dessert
all the dishes should be removed, save the drinking: glasses, and all
crumbs should be lifted from the cloth by means of the crumb knife and
tray. A dessert plate and dessert spoon and knife provided they are
needed, should then be placed in front of each guest. Coffee (made
after the manner of after dinner coffee) should be passed last,
demi-tasse, and served clear. Sugar and cream should follow, in order
that those who prefer either or both, may help themselves as they
please.




Proper Vegetables and Sauces to Serve With Meats

Kookery Kinks


Fish may be scaled more quickly if dipped in boiling water for a
moment.

Do not wash meats in water, wipe them with a wet cloth.

The whites of eggs will whip more readily if a pinch of salt is added
to them. If the eggs are placed in cold water for a time before being
broken, they will whip easily.

A small quantity of soda, stirred into milk or cream, will keep it from
souring in hot weather.

A few drops of lemon juice added to the water in which potatoes are
boiled will prevent the potatoes turning dark when cooked.

In mixing liquids with salads, add the liquid to the salad by degrees.
They will blend more readily.

To preserve the color of green vegetables put them on to cook in
boiling water with a pinch of soda; or, keep the cover off the kettle
while boiling them.

If you use too much salt by mistake add a trifle of sugar or a vinegar,
according to the dish. This will counteract the salty taste.


Measuring Hints

A cupful of liquid means all the cup will hold.

A spoonful of liquid is all the spoon will hold.

Salt, flour, seasoning spices, butter and all salads are measured
level.

To measure a level spoonful, dip the spoon into the dry material,
taking up a heaping spoonful, then level it off even with the edge of
the spoon with a knife.

To measure a part of a spoonful, cut lengthwise of the spoon for the
half and crosswise for the quarter.

A tablespoonful of butter should be measured before melting.

A tablespoonful of melted butter should be measured after being melted.

Measure a cupful of cream before it is whipped.

Measure a cupful of whipped cream after it is whipped.

Always sift flour, salt, baking powder, spices, powdered sugar and soda
before measuring. If measured in a solid state before sifting much more
than the quantity called for will be used.

When ice is not to be had, half fill a large flat bottomed bowl with
cold water. Set in this the vessels containing milk, butter, sauces,
etc. Cover with napkins which dip down into the water and set the whole
thing in a draft. Evaporation will keep everything sweet and cool.

Fruit cake recipes usually call for dried currants. These are hard and
lack flavor. Try using an equal measure of chopped prunes. They hold
moisture and impart a delicious flavor to the cake.

Use a large sponge for general house cleaning instead of a brush. It
gets a good grip on the dirt and is not so sloppy.

Silver may be cleaned by laying in a pan of sour milk for several hours
then washed and wiped dry.

Keep lemons in cold water. Change every few days.


Notes

A little sugar added to cream before whipping will prevent it from
turning to butter.

Use scant measure of sugar in custard pie and do not cook after the
custard is set sufficiently to cut with a silver knife, if you want a
smooth and palatable baked custard.

A small dish of water placed in the oven will prevent scorched or
burned food when the oven is hotter than it should be.

Save bread crusts and dry them in the warming closet of the kitchen
range, to roll fine for a coating for fried oysters, croquettes and
cutlets. Dried crumbs are better for dressing and puddings also.

Drop a few slices of raw potatoes in the hot lard used for frying
doughnuts to clarify the grease before putting it away for future use.




Laundry Work


In laundry work different methods must be used for different fabrics.
The texture and color of a garment must be considered before method of
laundering is decided on. As laundry is the heaviest part of house work
one should carefully consider all means by which strength may be saved.
A careful sorting of all clothes. Thorough soaking of all articles that
will not be injured thereby. A generous use of good soap and a well
equipped room for laundry purposes with plenty of good soft water will
to some extent lighten the labor. Chemicals judicially used have been
found helpful. A good solution for loosening dirt and may be used in
soaking the different kinds of clothes including prints and flannels is
given out and recommended by the Agricultural school of Minnesota. It
is made as follows: Procure 10 cents worth of salts of tartar, 10 cents
worth of crystal ammonia, one can of Lewis lye. Dissolve all in a
gallon of warm but not boiling water and cork tightly. When wanted for
use a teacupful of the mixture for from three to four pailsful warm
water will be the right amount to use when soaking clothes.


Laundry References

Use borax water to wash sateen. This method will restore the gloss to
the goods.

Use warm water to sprinkle your starched clothes.

Fine ginghams and percales dipped in sweet milk instead of starch,
gives them that dainty, glossy dressing they have when new.

Ink Stains--Soak in sour milk. If a dark stain remains, rinse in a weak
solution of chloride of lime.

Blood Stains--Soak in cold salt water then wash in warm water with
plenty of soap, afterward boil.

Grass Stains--Saturate the spot thoroughly with kerosene, then put them
in the washtub.

Iodine Stains--Wash with alcohol, then rinse in soapy water.

Hot Tea and Coffee Stains--Soak the stained fabric in cold water;
wring; spread out and pour a few drops of glycerine on each spot. Let
it stand several hours; then wash with cold water and soap.

Iron Rust--Soap the stain thoroughly with lemon juice; sprinkle with
salt and bleach for several hours in the sun.

Grease Spots--Hot water and soap generally remove these. If fixed by
long standing, use ether, chloroform or naptha. All three of these must
be used away from fire or artificial light.

Mildew--Soak in a weak solution of chloride of lime for several hours.
Rinse in cold water.

Sewing Machine Oil Stains--Rub with lard. Let stand for several hours,
then wash with cold water and soap.

Scorch Stains--Wet the scorched place, rub with soap and bleach in the
sun.

Fruit Stains--Stretch the fabric containing the stain over the mouth of
a basin and pour boiling water on the stain. In cold weather fruit
spots can frequently be removed by hanging the stained garments out of
doors over night. If the stain has been fixed by time soak the article
in a weak solution of oxalic acid or hold the spot over the fumes of
sulphur.

Here is an excellent cleansing fluid that will leave no rings or water
lines: One pint of benzine, an ounce of ether and an ounce of
chloroform. Shake well before using and keep tightly corked. An
absorbent pad (white blotting paper or thick towel) should be placed
beneath the material. Apply cleanser with a soft linen cloth and rub
stain lightly until it disappears. Beware of fire.

Cover the grass stains with common black molasses--the thickest you can
get--and rub it in with the finger until the fabric is saturated. Leave
it on for a day and wash out with clear water. A homely but an
effectual process.

For a rust stain, wet the spot and cover with oxalic acid, rub it in
well, and then wash off with clean, tepid water.

Soak the white articles in sour milk or in buttermilk all night. Rinse
in the morning and sun all day, wetting hourly with cream of tartar
water. Rinse again in the evening and repeat the soaking. If one trial
does not wholly remove the mildew, repeat the process.

REVIVING BLACK DRESSES.--Wash black cashmere, mohair, voile or other
black dress goods, in soap suds until clean, then rinse well. Put
bluing into water enough to cover the cloth well until it looks almost
black. Put in the cloth and rinse it about in the water, then be sure
it is all under water and leave it over night. Lift from this bluing
water directly to the line without wringing and let hang until almost
dry, then press on the wrong side on an entirely smooth ironing sheet.

TO LAUNDER A BLACK COTTON DRESS.--Black and white or all black muslin
dresses seldom look well when they come from the laundry and black
cotton does not appear to make a good "tub" dress. But if the following
method is tried it will give the cotton a clear look and stiffness like
new. Mix one half cup of flour with cold water to make smooth, then
turn on two quarts of boiling water and cook five minutes. Add this
starch, to enough warm water to wash the dress or waist in and wash the
garment without using a particle of soap. Rinse in two waters and hang
to dry. Just before ironing sprinkle on the wrong side.

REMEDY FOR PALLOR.--An excellent lotion in case of pallor is made from
one tablespoon of tincture of benzoin and three ounces of rose water.

EGGS PRESERVED IN WATER GLASS.--(Silicate of Sodine.) By this method
eggs may be kept fresh for eight months if rules are carefully
followed. Boil a quantity of water and allow it to cool. Use one gallon
of water and one quart of water glass and stir until thoroughly mixed.
Use a glazed stone jar and deposit the eggs into the solution and see
that the eggs are covered to the depth of at least an inch. The jar
must be covered and stored in a cold place. The eggs must be perfectly
fresh and best results are obtained if they are put in the solution as
gathered from the nests each day. The shells must also be perfectly
clean.--Mrs. Harry Hansen.

WASHING FLUID.--This fluid is guaranteed not to injure or take the
color out of any fabric and may be used in soaking white clothes,
prints and flannels. It is made and used as follows: Heat one gallon of
water. Add one can Lewis lye, ten cents worth of crystal ammonia and
ten cents worth of salts of tartar. Have water hot but not boiling and
cork solution in a gallon jug. A teacupful to three or four pails of
hot water is the amount needed in soaking soiled clothes.--Mrs. Harry
Hansen.




Home Remedies for Simple Ailments


LINSEED POULTICE.--Four ounces linseed meal and ten ounces of boiling
water. Mix gradually. Dip spoon in boiling water when you spread this
mixture on the poultice cloth. Bind on inflamed parts.

MUSTARD POULTICE.--Two ounces of dry mustard mixed with the whites of
two eggs to a paste. Spread on a cloth in a thick paste and apply while
it is fresh and wet.

COLDS.--For a cold in the head just appearing inhale spirits of
camphor. Put one or two drops of camphor on a small lump of sugar,
dissolve in a wine glass of water, (one gill) and take a teaspoonful
every half hour. Take a good cathartic or drink four or five glasses of
hot water at bed time and in half an hour follow with four more glasses
of hot water. Gargle sore throat with warm water and alcohol or warm
water and salt using one level teaspoon of salt to a pint of water. If
cold has made the throat or lungs sore, dip a cloth in cold water,
wring dry and spread it on throat or chest. Cover with three
thicknesses of dry flannel and bind it on securely. Take a hot foot
bath and go to bed. This treatment should cure your cold. If is doesn't
it will be a wise thing to call a physician in the morning before
alarming symptoms are developed. Bathe frequently, drink plenty of
water and keep the bowels in regular action and prevent colds.

TO REDUCE SWELLINGS.--Tincture of arnica or witch hazel applied to a
bump on the head or a bruise where the skin is not broken brings relief
from pain and often prevents inflammation and bad swellings.

CUTS AND SCRATCHES.--Apply peroxide to cuts, scratches and all bruises
where the skin is broken. This remedy often serves as a preventative to
blood poisoning.

WHEN A BUTTON IS SWALLOWED.--Children sometimes swallow buttons, fruit
stones, thimbles and pennies. When the mother is sure that the child
has swallowed a foreign substance the child should be encouraged and
even compelled to eat plentifully of mashed potatoes, thick mush and
coarse bread. Then follow with syrup of rhubarb or castor oil. Do not
give the cathartic immediately on finding out the accident but make
sure that much bulky food is taken. Give a child slippery elm to chew
when it swallows a penny or button or hard object. This forms a
slippery coating on the surface of the penny in the stomach which aids
it in passing easily through the intestine and prevents its lodging
there and was the remedy applied by a physician when called.--Mrs.
Whitehead.

CRAMPS IN THE LEG.--Sleep with hot water bag at the feet. A garter tied
tightly around the leg often effects a cure. Quick, hard rubbing is
best in sudden, painful attacks. Often it is essential to walk about
the room to bring the circulation of blood to the feet again.

INSECT BITES.--A teaspoonful of tincture of wild rosemary to a glass of
water. Apply this lotion frequently to the inflamed parts.

GOOD LINIMENT.--One ounce of camphor, four ounces olive oil. Dissolve
the gum in the oil and add one quarter of an ounce of chloroform. Shake
well and apply to affected parts. This is for external use only.

CURE FOR HICCOUGHS.--Lump of sugar saturated with vinegar will usually
cure hiccoughs in a child. Drink of water often brings immediate
relief. In prolonged cases of hiccoughing, weak, hot coffee with cream
and sugar given at frequent intervals has cured the patient.

NOSE BLEED.--Snuff powdered alum up the nose. This alum is also good
for checking hemorrhage, sometimes caused by extracting teeth. Fill the
cavity with the alum. Apply cold salt water to bleeding nose if you
haven't alum.

CORNS.--Bind bread soaked in vinegar on the corns day and night and
they will come out by the roots.

WARTS.--Prick with a needle (sterilized by boiling in clear water for
ten minutes) until the wart bleeds then apply soda.

BUNIONS.--Pulverize salt petre and sweet oil mixed well and applied to
the sore joints often brings relief. Bunions are usually caused by
wearing shoes too short.

SUMMER COMPLAINT OR DIARRHOEA.--In early stages unless alarming
symptoms appear, give the child or patient a generous dose of castor
oil and keep patient on a light diet for a day or two or refrain from
eating at all for twelve hours. If passages are green and full of
mucous membrane call a physician immediately as delay may be fatal.
Whites of two eggs mixed with a little water sipped frequently is often
healing also to stomach and bowels.

GOOD WAY TO GIVE CASTOR OIL.--Put a tablespoon of orange juice into a
small tumbler, pour in the required amount of oil, and more orange
juice on top. The oil forms a ball in the middle of the juice and is
swallowed without coming in contact with the tongue. Wine may be used
instead of orange juice.

BURNS.--Grated raw peeled potatoes spread on bandages and bound on a
badly burned arm, shoulder and hand brought immediate relief to one of
my children once when I was on a farm and could not get a doctor. I
kept the bandages moist by binding fresh new, wet ones over the old
ones until pain ceased but did not remove the dressing at all until
wound was healed. It healed perfectly without leaving any scar. Do not
know the merits of this remedy from a physician's standpoint but it was
used successfully in a bad hotel fire in a village where no physicians
resided and the patients all recovered from severe burns and there were
no scars left on their bodies.--Mrs. Whitehead.

LOCK UP POISONS.--All poisons should be labeled and kept in a
compartment by themselves. Such household remedies as laudenum,
chloroform, arsenic, aconite belladona, cough medicine, carbolic acid,
headache pellets or powders, linaments, opiates, fly poison, etc.,
should be kept in a locked box or in a covered can labeled "poison"
placed out of the reach of children. They should always be kept
separate from all other medicine. "An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure." Many deaths are caused by carelessness in placing
poisonous remedies within the reach of children. Unless poison can be
kept in a safe place, it is wiser always to throw it in the fire or to
bury it--and buy a new supply when needed than to run the risk of
poisoning a member of the family. Always look at the label on a bottle
before taking any medicine.

TOOTH ACHE.--Chloroform and clove oil applied with a piece of absorbent
cotton to the cavity of an aching tooth brings immediate relief.

CROUP.--Lard or goose grease and turpentine applied freely to the
throat and chest. Hot steam inhaled from a sponge dipped in boiling
water makes breathing easier. In serious cases an antiseptic should be
given to produce vomiting immediately until the physician arrives. Give
castor oil to a child showing symptoms of a croupy cough.

The Difference In Sewing Machines

It is a mistaken idea that sewing machines are pretty much alike, when
as a matter of fact there is a vast difference.

There is but one machine that sews better than any other--and that one
is the Singer.

This is because the Singer idea is distinctive--every year shows
improvement in that idea.

This is because the Singer factories are not only equipped with tools
and machinery better calculated to make good sewing machines than any
other, but this equipment is unique and not to be found elsewhere.

This is because a half century has been devoted to training and
specializing men each to do one thing best in sewing machine
construction. The Singer's superiority--its lifetime-lasting
value--does not appear on the surface.

One machine does sew better than any other--and that one is the Singer.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
