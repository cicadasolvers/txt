=PREFACE TO SEVENTH EDITION.=


[Illustration]

Dietetic Reform is now being considered seriously by thoughtful people
in all parts of the world and interest in this important though long
neglected subject is increasing every day.

The fact that our physical, mental, and spiritual conditions are
greatly influenced by the nature and quality of our daily food, and
that, consequently, our welfare depends upon a wise selection of the
same, is becoming generally recognized.

Popular illusions concerning the value of flesh-food have been much
dispelled during recent years by revelations concerning the physical
deterioration of the flesh-consuming nations, and the comparative
immunity from disease of people who live on purer and more natural
food; also by a succession of remarkable victories won by fruitarians
who have secured numerous athletic Championships and long distance
Records.

Demonstration has been provided by the Japanese, that a
non-carnivorous and hygienic Race can out-march and out-fight the
numerically superior forces of a colossal Empire; and that its
national and social life can be characterized by conspicuous
efficiency, sobriety, health, and vitality.

A vast amount of emphatic personal and medical testimony to the
advantages of the more simple and natural _fruitarian_ system of
living is being given by thousands of witnesses who speak from
experience; and such evidence is preparing the way for a complete
change of popular thought and custom concerning dietetics.

In addition to such influences, an ever-increasing consciousness that
the emancipation of the animal world from systematic massacre and
ruthless cruelty awaits the abandonment of the carnivorous habit by
the Western races of mankind, is exercising a powerful effect upon the
lives of multitudes of men and women. In consequence of having reached
a comparatively advanced stage of evolution, they realise the
solidarity of sentient life and feel humanely disposed towards all
fellow-creatures; and they cannot avoid the conviction that Man was
never intended to play the part of a remorseless and bloodthirsty
oppressor of the sub-human races.

Those who are labouring to bring about the adoption of dietetic
customs that neither violate the physical laws of our being, nor
outrage the humane sentiments of the higher part of our nature, are
consequently now met by serious requests for information concerning
some way of escape from bondage to ancestral barbaric custom, and the
safest path to a more rational and harmonious existence. "How may we
live out our full length of days in health and vigour, instead of
dying of disease?" "How may we avoid the painful maladies that are
prevalent, and escape the surgeon's knife?" "How may we be delivered
from further participation in all this needless shedding of innocent
blood?" "How may we in a scientific way feed ourselves with simple and
hygienic food--with the kindly fruits of the earth instead of the
flesh of murdered creatures who love life just as we do?" Such
questions as these are being asked by thousands of earnest souls, and
it is to help such enquirers that this Guide-Book is published.

My aim has been to give practical, reliable and up-to-date information
in a concise form, avoiding superfluous matter and 'faddism,' and only
supplying simple recipes which do not require the skill of a 'chef'
for their interpretation. By spending a few hours in thoughtful study
of the following pages, and by practising this reformed system of diet
and cookery in domestic life for a few weeks, any intelligent person
can master the chief principles of fruitarian dietetics, and become
qualified to prepare appetising dishes suited to the taste of a hermit
or a _bon vivant_ (provided that its possessor be not hopelessly
enamoured of the "flesh-pots of Egypt" and the flavour of cooked
blood).

A system of living that is earnestly recommended by thousands of
disinterested advocates who have personally tried it, that comes to us
full of promise both for ourselves and others, that bids fair to
humanize and transform mankind and to solve many of the world's
social problems, and that is now endorsed by so many progressive
medical authorities, merits such attention, and is worthy of trial.

As I am writing a _Guide_ to reformed diet for domestic use--not an
elaborate treatise to justify it--I have refrained from introducing
medical and experimental testimony concerning the dangerous and
injurious nature of flesh-food, and the advantages of living upon the
fruits of the earth, supplemented by dairy products. Numerous standard
works are now obtainable which demonstrate that the principles and
arguments upon which the Food-Reform Movement is based are supported
by an array of scientific evidence which is more than sufficient to
convince any unprejudiced, logical and well-balanced mind. For such
information I must refer my readers to other publications, and I have
printed a short list of useful works on the final pages of this book,
for the benefit of those who are as yet unacquainted with such
literature.

For some of the recipes contained in the following pages I am indebted
to certain of the Members of The Order of the Golden Age, and to other
workers in the Food-Reform Cause--but especially to Mrs. Walter Carey,
who has devoted much time to the task of preparing and testing them.
Most of them are original, being the result of thoughtful experiment;
and they should, _if carefully followed_, result in the production of
dishes which will give satisfaction. But if certain recipes do not
commend themselves to some of my readers, they are invited to
remember that human palates differ considerably, and to try other
dishes with the hope that they will like them better.

With the earnest desire that all who read this book will make some
sincere endeavour to seek emancipation from the barbaric habits that
are prevalent in Western lands, and to cease from that physical
transgression in the matter of diet into which our forefathers, at
some period of the world's history, appear to have fallen with such
disastrous consequences to themselves and their posterity, it is sent
forth upon its humble but beneficent mission. And I trust that many,
when they have proved that such a way of living is both possible and
advantageous, will strive to persuade others to live as Children of
God, rather than as the beasts of prey.

Those who have reached that spiritual plane where the sacredness of
all sentient life becomes recognised, and who find it painful to
contemplate the wanton and cruel slaughter which at present takes
place throughout Christendom--involving the death of at least a
million large animals every day--must instinctively experience a
longing to apprehend some way by which this butchery can be brought to
an end. Such will be able to perceive the real significance of, and
necessity for, the twentieth-century crusade against human
carnivoracity--the Moloch idol of these modern days. They will also
feel individually constrained to co-operate in the great work of
bringing about this practical and beneficent Reformation, and of
giving to mankind the blessings that will result from it.

As in the case of all previous editions of this book, any financial
profit derived from its sale will be devoted to the exaltation of
these humane and philanthropic ideals--hence its presentation to The
Order of the Golden Age. My readers, therefore, who feel that its
circulation will tend to lessen the sum total of human and sub-human
suffering, are invited to assist in securing for it a large
circulation, by lending or presenting copies to their friends, and
making it widely known. And to attain this end, the sympathetic aid of
journalists and other leaders of public thought will be especially
appreciated.

=THE TRUE IDEAL IN DIET.=


[Illustration: Man is by Nature Fruitarian--_not_ Carnivorous!!]

The physical structure of Man is declared by our most eminent
biologists and anatomists to be that of a _frugivorous_ (fruit-eating)
animal. It is, therefore, our Creator's intention that we should
subsist upon the various fruits of the earth--not upon the products of
the shambles.[1]

[1] See "The Testimony of Science in Favour of Natural and Humane
Diet."

The accepted scientific classification places Man with the anthropoid
apes, at the head of the highest order of mammals. These animals bear
the closest resemblance to human beings, their teeth and internal
organs being practically identical, and in a natural state they
subsist upon nuts, seeds, grains, and other fruits. Hence those who
have studied this subject thoroughly can hardly entertain any doubt
that the more largely our diet consists of these simple products of
nature, the more likely we shall be to enjoy health and to secure
longevity.

The number and variety of such fruits and seeds is very great
(including all the nuts and cereals _and their products_, as well as
the pulses, legumes, etc.); and the Science of Dietetics has made such
rapid progress in recent years that nuts and grains are, for the
benefit of those who possess weakened digestive organs, now prepared
in various ways which make them easily digestible and very savoury
when cooked. To such foods may be added, for the sake of convenience
and variety, vegetables of various kinds and dairy produce, such as
milk, butter, cheese and eggs.

[Sidenote: =Personal Testimony.=]

Nineteen years of abstinence from flesh-food (practised without any
illness, and resulting in increased strength, stamina and health), and
of observation and experiment during that period, combined with the
knowledge obtained through helping hundreds of men and women to regain
health by reforming their habits of living, have convinced me that a
well selected fruitarian dietary, thus supplemented, will prove
beneficial to all who desire physical and mental fitness. Temporary
difficulties may be experienced by some in adopting such a simple
style of living, or in obtaining adequate provision in their present
domestic conditions; mistakes may be made--certain necessary elements
being omitted from the new diet--and temporary failure may sometimes
result in consequence; but if some preliminary study and consideration
are given to the matter, and _variety_ in the food is secured to
ensure complete nourishment, success is easily obtainable.

[Sidenote: =A Step at a Time.=]

In most cases where there is a desire to adopt this purer and better
way, it will be found that the policy of proceeding slowly but surely,
a step at a time, is the wisest in the end.

The first step must be total abstinence from the flesh and blood of
animals, and the substitution of less objectionable food containing an
equal amount of proteid; this will soon lead to a distaste for fowl,
but the use of fish should be retained by those commencing to reform
their ways until some experience has been gained, and any serious
domestic difficulties which may exist have been removed. Then this
partial vegetarian diet can be still further purified, until it is
more entirely "fruitarian" in its nature. Circumstances, and
individual sentiment and taste, must regulate the rate of this
progress towards what may be termed Edenic living; I can but show the
way and give helpful information.

[Sidenote: =Advantages of Fruitarianism.=]

A few of the reasons which lead me to advocate a fruitarian dietary as
the ideal one, are as follows:--

Persons who live chiefly upon fruits of all kinds do not injure
themselves by consuming the poisonous waste-products (uric acid, &c.),
contained in flesh; and they are not often tempted, like those who
partake of very savoury and toothsome dishes, to eat after the needs
of the body are satisfied. They thus escape two of the chief causes of
disease and premature death--_auto-intoxication and excessive eating_.
They also avoid, to a great extent, the temptation to eat when they
are not hungry, and thus they are more likely to obey the dictates of
natural instinct concerning _when to eat_. Even if fruit should be
taken in excessive quantity, very little harm results from such
indiscretion.

Fruitarians thus lessen the amount of work put upon the digestive
organs, and consequently have more energy to expend upon mental or
physical labour. The grape sugar contained in sweet fruits--such as
dates, figs, raisins and bananas--is assimilated almost without effort
and very quickly.

The juices of ripe fruits help to eliminate urates, waste products,
and other harmful deposits from the blood and tissues, as they act as
solvents. Fruit, therefore, tends to prevent ossification of the
arteries, premature old age, gouty and rheumatic disorders, sickness
and untimely death.

Fruitarian diet--if scientifically chosen and containing all the
elements required by the body--prevents the development of the "drink
crave," and it will cure nearly all cases if properly and wisely
adopted. Dipsomania is induced by malnutrition, by eating stimulating
food, such as flesh, or by eating to excess; a fruitarian drunkard has
not yet, so far as I am aware, been discovered in this country.

Pure blood is secured by living upon such food, and consequently there
is little or no tendency to develop _inflammatory_ maladies. The
wounds of Turkish and Egyptian soldiers have been found to heal three
times as quickly as those of shamble-fed Englishmen; the reason is
that they live chiefly upon dates, figs and other fruits, milk and
lentils, etc.; and the same tendency has been observed in the case of
the Japanese wounded. A wonderful immunity from sickness is enjoyed by
those who live in accord with Nature's plan; microbes and disease
germs do not find a congenial environment in their bodies. This I have
proved by nearly twenty years of uninterrupted good health, and
freedom from medical attendance, and my experience is corroborated by
that of a multitude of witnesses in the ranks of the food-reformers.

Fruitarian diet, if complete, tends to lessen irritability, to promote
benevolence and peace of mind, to increase the supremacy of the
'higher self,' to clear and strengthen spiritual perception, and to
lessen domestic care. Those who desire to develop the higher spiritual
powers which are latent in Man, to cultivate the psychic or intuitive
senses, and to win their way to supremacy over their physical
limitations, will find fruitarianism helpful in every respect. Such
have only to _try it_, intelligently, in order to prove that this is
true.

Such a system of living may thus become an important factor in the
great work of uplifting our race from the _animal_ to the _spiritual_
plane; and herein lies the great hope for mankind. The harbingers of
the 'Coming Race'--a more spiritual Race--are already treading this
Earth, known and recognized by those whose eyes have been opened to
the vision of the higher and transcendent life. And that which tends
to accelerate the development of these characteristics is worthy of
our serious consideration and earnest advocacy.

Such a diet does not necessitate the horrible cruelties of the
cattle-boat and the slaughter-house--therefore it must commend itself
to every genuine humanitarian.

It does not contain the germs of disease that are found in the dead
bodies of animals--frequently afflicted with tuberculosis, cancer,
foot-and-mouth-disease, incipient anthrax, swine-fever and parasites
of various kinds.

It is free from that potent cause of physical malady, uric acid--which
is contained in all flesh; and from "ptomaines,"--which develop in
corpses quickly after death and often prove fatal to consumers of
meat. And it will be found, if wisely chosen, to produce a stronger
body, a clearer brain, and a purer mind.

The testimony of thousands of living advocates, both in cold and warm
climates--many of whom are medical men, or athletes who have
accomplished record performances which demanded prolonged endurance
and unusual stamina--bears evidence to this fact; therefore those who
are desirous of commencing this more excellent way of living need not
fear they are making any reckless or dangerous experiment.

The food which our Creator _intended_ us to eat must be the _safest_
and _best_ for us. Man does not resemble, either internally or
externally, any carnivorous animal, and no unprejudiced student of
the subject can well escape the conclusion that when we descend to the
level of the beasts of prey, by eating flesh, we violate a physical
Law of our being, and run the risk of incurring the inevitable
penalties which Nature exacts for such transgressions.

[Illustration]

These penalties are being lavishly dealt out with inexorable
impartiality in the civilized lands of the Western world, where, in
spite of the rapid increase of our medical men, and the 'wonderful
discoveries' of panaceas by the representatives of unscrupulous
pathological search, such maladies as appendicitis, consumption,
cancer, lunacy, gout, neurasthenia and other evidences of physical
deterioration are still prevalent or steadily increasing.

And, although the fact is not so apparent to the superficial observer,
a still heavier penalty in the form of spiritual loss is being
suffered by those who err in this respect, for _carnal food_ produces
_carnal-mindedness_, dims the spiritual vision, chains the soul to the
material plane of thought and consciousness, and makes the supremacy
of the 'spirit' over the 'flesh' well-nigh impossible.

It is natural for every man and woman to live at least a century. The
fact that thousands have done so, proves that the majority might
attain this age if they would cease from transgressing Nature's laws.
Seneca truly said, "Man does not die, he kills himself."

By "eating to live," instead of "living to eat"--introducing into our
bodies pure and vitalizing energy by means of wisely chosen natural
food--and by amending our ways generally in accordance with the
dictates of reason and common sense, we may live to benefit the world
by useful service with our faculties matured and our minds stored by
the teachings of experience. Instead of being in our dotage when we
reach threescore years and ten, we should still be fit to serve our
day and generation.

[Sidenote: =The Highest Motive.=]

Those who decide to adopt this reformed system of diet will be
fortified in their resolve if they are actuated by loyalty to the
Divine Will and regard for Humane Principle, in addition to reasons
which are based merely upon self-interest. The desire to lessen
suffering, and to live in accordance with God's laws, furnishes a
stronger incentive than the wish to escape disease and to secure
longevity.

A philanthropist or humanitarian who embraces the sublime ideal of
helping to lift mankind to a higher plane of experience, to deliver
our degenerate Race from some of the worst evils which afflict us,
and, at the same time, to prevent the infliction of pain and death in
most revolting forms upon countless millions of innocent animals, will
either conquer the initial difficulties which confront those who thus
make practical protest against the flesh traffic, or will cheerfully
endure temporary inconvenience and self-denial "for Righteousness'
sake."

Each new recruit who joins the Food-Reform Movement should therefore
give such preliminary study to the subject as will produce the
unalterable conviction that flesh-eating is an _unnatural_ habit for
Man, that it is totally _unnecessary_, that reliable medical evidence
proves it to be generally _injurious_, and that it involves cruelty
and bloodshed which are barbarous and indefensible, _because quite
needless_.

A deaf ear will then be turned to the warnings of any well-disposed
friends who, being under the spell of ancient fallacies, or ignorant
concerning the nutritive advantages which the fruits of the earth
possess over the products of the shambles, would seek to deter him
from the path of self-reform by prophesying physical shipwreck and
disaster.

Popular illusions concerning the necessity for animal food are rapidly
being swept away, and public opinion has already changed to such an
extent that leaders of thought in every land are now impressed with
the full import and beneficence of this Reformation. And so many
forces are now converging and combining to influence and impel mankind
in this direction, that the 'signs of the times' indicate a rapidly
approaching Era in which Man will return to his original food, and, by
so doing, enter upon a happier and more peaceful period of existence
upon this planet.




=A PLEA FOR THE SIMPLE LIFE.=


Simple meals and simple dishes are easily prepared, they lessen
domestic care, are less likely to cause indigestion, and soon become
appreciated and preferred.

[Illustration]

Few persons realize how little they know the true taste of many
vegetables; the majority having never eaten them _separately_ or
cooked in a proper manner. A cauliflower skilfully served as a
separate course, either "au gratin" or with thin melted butter
slightly flavoured with a few drops of Tarragon vinegar, or with
tomato sauce, has quite a different taste from that which is
experienced when it is mixed up with gravy, meat, potatoes and other
articles or food.

Young green peas, or new potatoes steamed in their skins and dried off
in the oven so as to be "floury," will, if eaten with a little salt
and butter, have a delicacy of flavour which is scarcely noticeable if
they are served with a plate of beef or mutton and other vegetables. A
few chestnuts carefully cooked in a similar manner, make a dish that
an overfed alderman might enjoy; and the same remark will apply to
many simple and easily prepared fruitarian dishes.

It is a mistake to think that this reformed diet necessarily involves
a great amount of cooking, for the reverse is the fact if _simplicity_
is aimed at and its advantages are appreciated. It is well to remember
also that our most enlightened and progressive physicians are now
recommending uncooked foods of all kinds to all who would retain or
regain health.

An excellent lunch can be made with some well chosen cheese and brown
bread and butter, and a delicate lettuce (dressed with pure olive oil,
a small quantity of French wine vinegar, and a pinch of sugar),
followed by fresh and dried fruits such as bananas, almonds, raisins,
figs, etc. Such a repast is inexpensive, nutritious, and easily
digestible. A large variety of foreign and fancy cheeses are now
obtainable, so that even such a simple meal as this can be varied
constantly. The best lettuces are produced by our French neighbours,
but our own market gardeners are beginning to learn that it is easy to
get them tender by growing them under glass.

[Sidenote: =The Simple Breakfast.=]

In most fruitarian households the cooking for breakfast soon becomes
simplified and lessened. Eggs served in different ways on alternate
mornings, fresh and dried fruits, nuts, brown bread, super cooked
cereals such as granose biscuit, butter and preserves, are found to be
quite sufficient as accompaniments to the morning beverage. French
plums, figs and other dried fruits, when carefully stewed in the oven
for some hours, and served with cream, are very nutritious. A small
plate of 'Manhu' wheat, rye, barley, or oat flakes, served with hot
milk or cream, can be added so as to make a more solid meal for
growing children or hard workers. And those who are accustomed to a
more elaborate breakfast, because of the difficulty of obtaining a
mid-day substantial meal, can select one of the items which are
mentioned in the list of recipes under the heading of "Breakfast
Dishes."

[Sidenote: =Avoid Dyspepsia.=]

One reason for urging simplicity is that, owing to prevalent ignorance
concerning food-values, it is more easy for the _inexperienced_
food-reformer to make dietetic mistakes than the flesh-eater.

By partaking freely of stewed acid fruits and vegetables at the same
meal, or by blending a great variety of savouries, vegetables, sweets
and rich fatty dishes together in a ghastly 'pot pourri,' or by eating
to excess of porridge, beans, or fried dishes, many have made serious
blunders. They, for want of proper instruction, have hastily come to
the conclusion that "vegetarian diet does not suit them," and
returning to the flesh-pots, have henceforth denounced the evangel of
dietetic reform, instead of profiting by the useful lesson Nature
tried to teach them.

The wisest plan is to make one's diet generally _as varied as
possible_, but not to mix many articles together _at the same meal_.

Abstainers from flesh should begin to live to some extent (say two
days a week) in picnic style, and the practice will soon become more
habitual. A picnic luncheon which is considered enjoyable in the woods
or on the moors will be found to be just as nice at home if the
articles provided are well chosen and tastefully prepared. Variety can
be obtained by introducing daintily cut sandwiches made with mustard
and cress, tomato paste, potted haricots, or lentils, scrambled eggs,
fancy cheese cut thinly, flaked nuts and honey, etc. Fresh and dried
fruit, nuts, almonds, raisins and sultanas, fruit cakes, and custard
or rice puddings, provide useful additions; and it will soon be found
that the old-fashioned three or four-course meal which involves such
laborious preparation is a needless addition to life's many cares.

[Sidenote: =Necessary Elements in Food.=]

It is important to bear in mind that our daily food must contain a
sufficient quantity of certain necessary elements:

(1) PROTEIN. To be found in nuts and nut foods (such as Protose,
Nuttoria and Fibrose, &c.), eggs, cheese, brown bread, oatmeal,
haricots, lentils and peas.

(2) FAT. To be obtained in nuts, nut-butters, olive oil, cheese, milk,
cream, butter, and oatmeal.

(3) PHOSPHATES AND MINERAL SALTS. Contained in the husk of wheat,
barley, oats, and rye (therefore included in brown bread, granose
biscuits and other whole-wheat or cereal preparations), cheese,
bananas and apples.

(4) SUGAR. To be obtained from all starch foods, but most easily and
in the best and most readily assimilable form from sweet fruits and
honey.




=A PLEA FOR MODERATION.=


[Illustration: Do not dig your grave with your teeth!]

One of the most frequent mistakes made by those who commence to live
upon a fleshless diet is that of eating too much--an error, also
committed by the general public. Often, through ignorance of the fact
that lean beef consists of water to the extent of about 75%, and
through having been brought up under the spell of the popular delusion
that meat is a great source of strength and stamina, they jump to the
conclusion that they must consume large plates of cereals and
vegetables in order to make up for their abstinence from animal food.
They bring upon themselves severe attacks of dyspepsia--either by
eating excessive quantities of starch in the form of porridge, bread
and potatoes, or of such concentrated foods as haricots, lentils or
nuts (being ignorant of the fact that these latter are much more
nutritious than lean beef and that only a very small quantity is
needed for a sufficient meal).[2]

[2] See Table of Food Values on page 45.

Nothing does more injury to the Food-Reform Movement than the
discredit which is brought upon it by those who upset themselves by
over-eating, and who feel led to justify their defection by attacking
the system they have forsaken. Among the numerous cases brought to my
notice, I remember one of a minister's wife, who by partaking of seven
meals a day, and finishing up at ten o'clock in the evening with
cocoa, cheese and porridge, brought herself to such a state of nervous
prostration that her local doctor ordered her to return to a flesh
diet, "as she required _nourishment_." He thus diagnosed her
condition, instead of attributing it to preposterous over-feeding.

A Golden Rule for every food-reformer is this--_Eat only when you are
hungry_, and never to repletion. An exception must be made, however,
in certain cases of anaemic and delicate persons. When there is not
sufficient vitality to cause appetite, or to digest food normally, it
is often necessary to insist on regular meals being taken,
notwithstanding the patient's distaste for food. Drowsiness and stupor
after a meal are sure signs of excess, and I cannot too strongly urge
temperance in diet. During my long experience of philanthropic work as
an advocate of natural and hygienic living, I have only heard of a few
cases of persons suffering any ill effects from eating too little,
whereas cases of the opposite sort have been rather numerous.
Ninety-nine per cent. of the centenarians of the world have been
characterized by _abstemiousness_; however much their ways and customs
may have otherwise differed, in this one respect they are practically
alike--declaring that they have always been small eaters, and
believers in moderation in all things.




=ARTISTIC COOKERY.=


In every household where reformed diet is adopted, effort should be
made to prepare the meals in an artistic manner. If a dish is
skilfully cooked and tastefully served it is not only more enjoyable
but more easily digested.

[Illustration]

The general custom in English homes is to serve vegetables in a rather
slovenly style. To see how nicely such things as legumes, vegetables,
salads and fruits can be prepared, one requires to go to a good French
or Italian restaurant. But it is quite easy for us to learn the ways
of our friends abroad, and to make our dishes look tempting and
appetising.

One of the first lessons to be learned by the vegetarian cook is how
to fry rissoles, potatoes, etc., _quite crisp_, and free from any
flavour of oil or fat. To do this a wire basket which will fit loosely
into a stewpan is necessary, and it can be purchased at any good
ironmonger's shop. Nutter (refined coconut butter) is a well prepared
form of vegetable fat, and it is retailed at a moderate price; it
keeps for a long period and is equally useful for making
pastry--three quarters of a pound being equal to one pound of butter.
Where nut-butters cannot be obtained, good olive oil should be used.

The temperature of the fat or oil must be past boiling point, and
should reach about 380 degrees. When it is hot enough it will quickly
turn a small piece of white bread quite brown, if a finger of it is
dipped in the fat. Unless this temperature is reached the articles to
be fried may turn out greasy and unbearable. If the fat is heated very
much beyond 400 degrees it may take fire. Haricots, lentils, and many
other legumes are more tasty if made into cutlets or rissoles and
fried in this manner, after being mixed with breadcrumbs and
seasoning, than if merely boiled or stewed in the usual crude style.

[Sidenote: =The Art of Flavouring.=]

The art of flavouring is also one which should be studied by every
housewife. By making tasty gravies and sauces many a dish which would
otherwise be insipid can be rendered attractive. The recipes for
"Gravies" will prove useful on this point.

Many valuable modern scientific food products are not fully
appreciated because people do not know how to serve them. Take
'Protose,' 'Nuttoria' and 'Nuttose' for instance--very useful
substitutes for flesh which are made from nuts (malted and therefore
half digested). If _slightly_ stewed, and eaten without any
flavouring, some persons dislike the distinctive taste; if, however,
they are well cooked, according to the recipes printed later on in
this book, and served with such garnishings as are recommended, they
are usually much enjoyed, even by those who are prejudiced against all
vegetarian ideas.

[Sidenote: =Cooking by Gas saves Labour.=]

Cooking by gas appliances is more easily controlled and regulated than
when the old-fashioned fire is employed, and much labour for stoking
and cleaning is avoided. Those who can do so, should obtain a gas
hot-plate, consisting of two or three spiral burners, and a
moderate-sized gas oven. If they cannot afford the ordinary gas
cooking oven, a smaller substitute can be obtained, which can be
placed upon any gas jet; this is very economical for cooking single
dishes, and for warming plates, etc. A gas cooking jet can be obtained
for eighteenpence, and two or three of these will take the place of a
hot-plate if economy is necessary. In summer-time the kitchen range is
quite a superfluity unless it is required for heating bath water.

[Sidenote: =A New Mission for Women.=]

The ordinary public know very little of the variety and delicacy of a
well chosen fruitarian dietary when thoughtfully prepared; ignorance
and prejudice consequently cause thousands to turn a deaf ear to the
evangel of Food-Reform. All women who desire to bring about the
abolition of Butchery, and to hasten the Humane Era, should therefore
educate themselves in artistic fruitarian cookery, and then help to
instruct others.

To illustrate the truth of these remarks I may mention that at a
banquet given by the Arcadian Lodge of Freemasons, at the Hotel Cecil,
in London--the first Masonic Lodge which passed a resolution to banish
animal-flesh from all its banquets--one of the Chief Officers of the
Grand Lodge of England attended. He came filled with prejudice against
the innovation and prepared to criticise the repast most unfavourably.
In his after-dinner speech, however, he admitted that it was one of
the best Masonic banquets he had ever attended, and said that if what
if he had enjoyed was "vegetarian diet," he was prepared to adopt it
if he found it possible to get it provided at home.

By practising the recipes which are given in the following pages, and
by utilizing the hints which accompany them, readers of this book will
find no difficulty in acquiring the skill which is requisite to win
many from the flesh-pots, even when they cannot be induced to abandon
them from any higher motives than self-interest or gustatory
enjoyment.

Every woman should resolve to learn how to feed her children with pure
and harmless food. Every mother should make her daughters study this
art and thus educate them to worthily fulfil their domestic
responsibilities. Here is a new profession for women--for teachers of
high-class fruitarian and hygienic cookery will soon be greatly in
demand.




=WHAT TO DO WHEN TRAVELLING.=


The difficulty of being properly catered for when staying at Hotels
was formerly a very real one, but owing to the enlightenment
concerning diet which is now taking place, and the rapid increase of
foreign restaurants and cafes in English-speaking countries it is
becoming lessened every day. The great variety of fleshless dishes now
supplied in nearly all light-refreshment restaurants, in response to
the public demand, is compelling even the largest Hotels to modify
their cuisine accordingly.

[Illustration]

For breakfast it is sometimes a good plan to order what one wants the
previous night, if any specially cooked dishes are required, but it is
_not_ advisable to inform the waiter that one is a vegetarian. It is
generally possible to obtain porridge, grilled tomatoes on toast,
poached or fried eggs, stewed mushrooms, etc., without giving extra
trouble or exciting comment. Where these cannot be obtained, a plain
breakfast of brown bread or toast and butter, with eggs, preserves and
fruit should be taken.

At large hotels in our chief cities a Restaurant and a Grill Room are
provided. The food-reformer should go to one of these for his dinner,
rather than to the dining room, as he will then be able to obtain
various simple _a la carte_ dishes. One 'portion' of any particular
dish will often suffice for two persons, thus enabling those whose
means are limited to obtain greater variety without increasing
expenditure. Care has to be exercised, however, concerning certain
dishes; for instance, if macaroni is required, it is well to ask the
waiter to request the cook not to introduce any chopped ham. He should
be told that you wish macaroni served with tomato sauce and cheese
only, in the "Neapolitan" style.

In most Continental Hotels and Restaurants the simplest, cheapest, and
best plan is to take 'table d'hote'--telling the head waiter well
beforehand that the lunch or dinner is required 'maigre' (that is
without flesh, just as it is usually served during Lent). A varied,
well selected, and ample repast will then be supplied at a moderate
cost. The same plan is best in 'Pensions.'

The general rule to be adopted in small British hotels is to think
beforehand what dishes the cook is in the habit of making which are
free from flesh; these should be ordered in preference to those which
are strange and not likely to be understood. At the same time it is
well to insist upon being supplied with anything which it is
reasonable to expect the proprietor to furnish, because such action
tends to improve the catering of the hotels of the country, to make it
easier for other food-reformers, and to sweep away the difficulty
which at present exists in some towns, of obtaining anything fit to
eat in the orthodox hotel coffee rooms, except beasts, birds, or
fishes.

[Sidenote: =Railway Journeys.=]

Those who are making railway journeys can easily provide themselves
with a simple luncheon basket containing fruits, sandwiches made with
flaked nuts, eggs, cheese or preserves, or with such delicacies as
haricot or lentil potted meat (directions for making which will be
found later on, in the section devoted to Luncheon Recipes.)
Travellers may perhaps be reminded that cheese and nuts contain much
more nutriment than lean meat.

Food-reformers who are about to pay a prolonged visit in a private
house should inform the hostess, when accepting her invitation, that
they are abstainers from flesh, but that their tastes are very simple
and that they enjoy anything except flesh-food. As she might have
erroneous ideas about the requirements of vegetarians she might
otherwise feel perplexed as to what to provide. If the visitor takes
fish the fact should be stated.

[Sidenote: =No Faddism.=]

Care should be taken not to involve the hostess in any needless
trouble, and she should be shown, by the simplicity of one's
requirements, that she is easily capable of affording complete
satisfaction. When she realizes this, she will probably take pleasure
in learning something about hygienic living, and will be ready to read
a pamphlet or a guide-book upon the subject, and to produce some of
the dishes contained in it.

The Humane Diet Cause has been much hindered by the 'fads' of persons
who have adopted very extreme views about diet and who worry
themselves and other people about trifling matters in connection with
their food until they are almost regarded as being pests in a
household. Instead of cheerfully partaking of anything that is
provided, except flesh, they parade their scruples about almost
everything on the table, and, consequently, those who entertain them
vow that they will never become such nuisances themselves or entertain
such again.

I have always found that by letting my friends clearly understand that
I abstain from butchered flesh chiefly because of _humane reasons_ and
for the sake of _principle_, they respect my sentiment, and evince a
desire to discuss the matter without prejudice. If fruitarianism is
adopted merely as a 'fad,' discordant vibrations are often aroused
because one's acquaintances consider that one is giving needless
trouble by being unconventional without sufficient justification.

[Sidenote: =Sea Voyages.=]

Those who are making a sea voyage will find that many of the large
steamship companies are quite prepared to furnish substitutes for
flesh-diet if an arrangement is made beforehand. In such cases there
should be a clear stipulation that brown bread, dried and fresh fruit,
nuts, farinaceous puddings, omelets, or dishes made with cheese,
macaroni, lentils, haricots, tomatoes, etc., should be obtainable in
some form and in sufficient variety. A list of a few 'specialities'
(such as Protose, Nuttoria, &c.) should be furnished when a long
voyage is contemplated, so that the steward may stock them.




=ADVICE FOR BEGINNERS.=


The following suggestions will prove helpful to those who are desirous
of adopting the reformed dietary:--

1. Give up flesh meat _at once_ and _entirely_--replacing it by dishes
made with eggs, cheese, macaroni, peas, lentils, nuts, and nut-meats.
Later on you will be able to do without fish also, but it is best to
proceed slowly and surely.

[Illustration]

2. Eat _less_ rather than _more_. Fruitarian foods such as the above
are more nourishing than butcher's meat.

3. Try to like _simple_ foods, instead of elaborate dishes that
require much preparation. Avoid 'frying-panitis.'

4. Eat dry foods rather than sloppy ones; they are more easily
digested. Take toast or Granose biscuits with porridge to assist
proper salivation. If porridge causes trouble, use wheat or rye flakes
(Manhu or Kellogg brands), with hot milk or cream, instead.

5. Do not mix stewed acid fruits with vegetables and legumes; take the
former with cereals, cheese, or eggs. Green vegetables should be taken
very sparingly, and with savoury dishes alone. If eaten with sweets
they are apt to disagree.

6. Persons of sedentary habits should let at least one meal a day
consist of uncooked fruit only--or of fruit with brown bread and
butter--the bread being _well baked_.

7. Dried fruits, such as figs, dates, prunes, raisins, sultanas, etc.,
are very easily digested; and if blended with nuts or almonds they
make a perfect meal. Such fruits may be taken freely and with
advantage by almost everyone.

8. Nuts should be flaked in a nut-mill to aid digestion; cheese can
also be made more easily assimilable in this way (or by cooking). Many
nut products are now sold which are malted and partially pre-digested.

9. Give a few hours' thought and study to the important subject of
your diet; learn what to do, and what newly-invented scientific foods
are obtainable.

10. Do not make the mistake of attempting to live on potatoes, white
bread, cabbages, etc., or merely upon the ordinary conventional
dietary with the meat left out. Obtain and use well made and well
cooked wholemeal bread every day. Take sufficient _proteid_, 1-1/2 to
2-ozs. per day, to avoid anaemia--indigestion often results from _lack
of vitality_ caused through chronic semi-starvation.

11. If you feel any symptoms of dyspepsia, and can trace it to
_excess_ in eating, or to dietetic errors, reduce your food, fast
temporarily, and take more exercise. Consider what mistakes you have
made, and avoid them in the future. Eat only when hungry, in such
cases.

12. If you are not getting on, obtain advice from a Doctor who is a
_fruitarian_ or from an experienced Food-reformer.




=Commercial Dietetic Inventions.=


A large number of special proprietary substitutes for animal food can
now be obtained to supplement the ordinary ones provided in the
household. The latest particulars concerning these can always be known
by reference to the advertisement pages of _The Herald of the Golden
Age_, and full information as to their use is supplied by the various
manufacturers. But although they are _useful_ and _convenient_ in many
households, they are not _absolutely essential_. 'Home-made' dishes
are often the best, being most economical, therefore it is advisable
that all food-reformers should learn how to make nut-meats, &c., at
home. Some of these substitutes are as follows:--

=For Meat-Extracts=: Marmite, Vegeton, Carnos, Nutril, Mapleton's
Gravy Essence, Cayler's Extract, Wintox.

=For Joints of Meat=: Protose, Nuttose, Savrose, Fibrose, F.R.
Nut-Meat, Vejola, Nuttoria, Shearn's Nut-Meat, Nutton, Brazose,
Nuto-Cream Meat, Mapleton's Frittamix.

=For Cold Meats=: "Pitman" Nut-Meat Brawn, Ellis's Tomato and Nut
Paste, Pasta-sol, Lentose, Nuska Viando, Savoury Paste, Potted Beans
and Lentils.

=For Meat Fat=: Nutter Suet, Vegsu, Nutter, Nucoline, and Nut
Margarine.

Pine Kernels, which contain 10 ozs. of oil to the pound, and which
when rolled and chopped exactly resemble suet, are also an excellent
substitute.

Delicious Nut-Butters are also now obtainable for high-class
cookery--such as Almond, Walnut, Cashew, and Table Nutter. Although
superior, these are as cheap as ordinary cooking butters.

=For Lard and Dripping=: Nutter, Darlene, Albene, Nut-oil, "Pitman"
Vegetable Lard.

=For Meat proteid=: Emprote, Hygiama, Horlick's Malted Milk, Casumen
Dried Milk, Gluten Meal.

=For Gelatin=: Agar-Agar, or Cayler's Jellies.

=For Animal Soups=: Mapleton's Nut and proteid Soups, and "Pitman"
Vegsal Soups.

=Prepared Breakfast Cereals=: Manhu flaked Wheat, Rye, Barley and
Oats, Kellogg Wheat and Corn Flakes, Granose Flakes and Biscuits,
Shredded Wheat, Archeva Rusks, Puffed Wheat, Power, Kornules, Toasted
Wheat Flakes, Melarvi Crisps and Biscuits.

=For Picnic Hampers=: Savage's Nut Foods or Cream o' Nuts, Wallace
Cakes and Scones, Mapleton's Nut Meats, Winter's Nut Cream Rolls,
"Pitman" Fruit and Nut Cakes and Nut Meat Brawn, Wallace P. R. or Ixion
or Artox or "Pitman" Biscuits.

=Meat Stock= is substituted by vegetable stock, produced by stewing
haricots, peas, lentils, etc. The latter is far more nutritious, and
is free from the uric acid and excrementitious matter that are present
in meat decoctions. A tasty and meaty flavour can be at once given to
soups or gravies by adding some vegetable meat-extract selected from
one of the varieties already mentioned.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the following pages recipes will be found for preparing dishes
which closely resemble, in taste, appearance, and nutritive value,
those to which the community have been accustomed, some of them being
of such a nature that persons who are fond of flesh-food find it
difficult to detect whether they are eating such or not.




=RELATIVE VALUES OF FOODS.=


=How to Regulate our Diet.=

Our food must contain certain elements, and in proper quantity, if the
body is to be well sustained, renewed and nourished. These are mainly
as follows:

    1. Protein to form flesh, build muscle, and produce strength.

    2. Fat and Carbohydrates, to provide heat and energy.

    3. Salts and minerals (such as phosphates, lime, iron, citrates,
    etc.) to build bones and teeth, feed the brain and nerves, and
    purify the body.

No hard-and-fast table or rule can be laid down concerning the proper
proportions in which these elements should be combined, because the
amount needful for each individual varies according to his size, the
sort of work he does, the amount of physical or mental energy he puts
forth, and the temperature of the atmosphere surrounding him.

Until Professor Chittenden made his extensive and conclusive series of
experiments in America, in 1903-4, to determine the real amount of
Protein and other elements required to keep the body in perfect
health, the average estimate for a person of average size, who does a
moderate amount of physical labour, was about 4-ozs. of Protein per
day.

But these official experiments, conducted with scientific precision,
extending over a long period, and made with thirty-four typical and
carefully graded representatives of physical and mental work,
demonstrated that half this amount of Protein is sufficient, and that
strength and health are increased when the quantity is thus reduced;
also that a smaller amount of Carbohydrate food (bread, etc.), than
was previously thought necessary, is enough.

One may therefore now safely reckon that men of average size and
weight (say 10 to 12 stone) doing a moderate amount of physical and
mental work, can thrive under ordinary circumstances on a daily ration
containing about 800 grains of Protein (nearly 2 ozs).

The following food chart will enable the reader to calculate
(approximately) how much food of any particular kind is necessary to
provide the above amount. Adult persons below the average size and
weight, and living sedentary rather than an active physical life, will
naturally require less than this normal standard. The relative cost
and economy of the different foods can also thus be ascertained.

If care is taken to secure a sufficient quantity of Protein the
requisite amount of Carbohydrates is not likely to be omitted, and
hunger will prove a reliable guide in most cases. It is advisable,
however, to see that enough Fat is taken, especially in winter, and by
persons lacking in nerve force.

The table of food-values will easily enable the reader to ascertain
the proportion of Fat in each kind of food.

The following indications of dietetic error may prove useful:--

[Sidenote: =Signs of Dietetic Mistakes.=]

Excess of proteid matter causes a general sense of plethora and
unbearableness, nervous prostration or drowsiness after meals, a
tendency to congestion (often resulting in piles, etc.), headache,
irritability, and bad temper. A continuous deficiency of it would tend
to produce general weakness and anaemia.

Excess of carbohydrate matter (starch), especially if not sufficiently
cooked and not well masticated, produces dyspepsia, flatulence, pain
in the chest and abdomen, acidity (resulting in pimples and boils),
and an inflammatory state of the system. Deficiency of it (or its
equivalent, grape sugar) would produce lack of force and physical
exhaustion.

Excess of fat tends to cause biliousness. Deficiency of it results in
nervous weakness, neuralgia, and low temperature of the body.

[Sidenote: =Food for Brain Workers.=]

It is important to remember that the more _physical_ energy we put
forth, the larger is the amount of proteid we require in our diet--and
vice versa. Brain workers of sedentary habits require but little
proteid, and quickly suffer from indigestion if this is taken too
freely. For such, a very simple diet consisting largely of dried
and fresh fruits, nuts (flaked or ground), milk, eggs and cheese, and
_super-cooked_ cereals (such as wholemeal biscuits, and toast,
Granose and Kellogg flakes, and well baked rice dishes) will be found
to be the most suitable.

In order to supply the brain with phosphates it is very important that
mental workers should take whole wheat bread instead of the
emasculated white substitute which is provided almost everywhere. It
is the outer part of the grain that provides brain-food (combined with
an _easily assimilable_ form of protein), and many of our urban bread
winners break down because they are deprived of the essential food
elements therein contained. To take 'standard' bread does not meet the
case, and every food-reformer who wants to keep really fit should
demand and obtain well baked and unadulterated wholemeal bread. I feel
convinced that if every growing child and every mental toiler could
always be supplied with bread of this type, the deterioration of our
British race would soon be arrested and we should witness signs of
physical regeneration. 'Artox' and 'Ixion' brands of pure whole
wheatmeal are the most perfect I know of at the present time, and
delicious bread can easily be made from them if the recipe printed on
page 114 is followed.

=FOOD CHART.=

    =Showing how to obtain sufficient (1) Protein--for body building.
    (2) Carbohydrates and Fat--for providing heat and energy.=

_A man of average size and weight (10 to 12 stone) doing a moderate
amount of physical labour requires about 800 grains of Protein per day
(nearly 2 ozs.). Women and sedentary workers require about 1-1/2 ozs.
(655 grains), and hard physical labourers about 1000 grains._

=VEGETARIAN SOUPS.=


=VEGETABLE STOCK.=

The best stock for vegetable soups is made from haricot beans. Take a
pound of these, pick and wash well, and soak for 10 or 12 hours in
cold water. Put them in a saucepan with the water in which they were
soaked, add a few of the coarser stalks of celery, 1 or 2 chopped
Spanish onions, a blade of mace, and a few white peppercorns. If
celery is not in season, use celery salt. Bring to a boil, skim, and
cook gently for at least 2 hours. Then strain, and use as required.


=1. Artichoke Soup.=

Take 2-lbs. of white artichokes, 3-pts. of water, 3 large onions, a
piece of celery (or some celery salt), 1/4-pt. of raw cream or 1-pt. of
milk. Boil together for 45 minutes, strain through a fine sieve and
serve. If cream is used it should not be added until after the soup is
cooked.


=2. Chestnut Soup.=

Take 1-lb. chestnuts, 1 or 2 onions, 1-1/2-pints vegetable stock, 1-oz.
nut-butter.

Boil the chestnuts for 15 minutes and peel them; put these with the
onions (sliced) into a roomy stewpan, with the butter, and fry briskly
for 5 minutes; now add the stock, with seasoning to taste, and bring
to the boil. Simmer gently until onions and chestnuts are quite soft,
and pass all through a hair sieve. Dilute with milk until the
consistency of thin cream, and serve with _croutons_.


=3. Rich Gravy Soup.=

To 3-pts. of haricot stock add 1 onion and 1 carrot (fried with butter
until brown), 1 stick of celery, 2 turnips and 6 peppercorns, and
thicken with cornflour. Boil all together for 1 hour, strain, return
to saucepan, and add 3 small teaspoons of Marmite. Warm it up, but
_not to boiling point_. Serve with fried bread dice. This soup, if
well made, is equal to anything that a French chef can produce.


=4. Mock Turtle Soup.=

Fry 6 good-sized onions in 1-oz. of butter till nicely browned, then
add 2 breakfastcups of German lentils, a good handful of spinach
leaves, a few capers, about 6 chillies, and 3 pints of water. Let this
simmer for 2 or 3 hours, then strain off, add 2 tablespoons of tapioca
which has been soaked for an hour or two. Boil till perfectly clear.
When ready for serving add salt to taste and 1 teaspoonful of Nutril.
Some small custard quenelles should be put in the tureen--made by
beating 1 egg in 2-ozs. flour and adding 1/4-pt. milk. Bake until firm
and cut into dice.


=5. Brown Haricot Soup.=

Boil 1/2-lb. beans in 2-qts. of water. When the beans crack, add a few
tomatoes, 1 leek sliced, or a Spanish onion, and a bunch of herbs.
Boil until the vegetables are tender, adding a little more water if
necessary. Rub all through a sieve, and return to pan, adding
seasoning, a good lump of butter, and the juice of half a small lemon
after the soup has boiled. If a richer soup is required add two
teaspoonfuls of Nuto-Cream or Marmite just before serving.


=6. Tomato Soup.=

Take a pound of tomatoes, a sliced onion, and 2-ozs. of tapioca
(previously soaked for some hours). Boil for an hour, then add salt,
pepper, and a little butter. Mix 1/2-pt. of milk with a teaspoonful of
flour; add this to the soup, stir and boil for 5 minutes.


=7. Egyptian Lentil Soup.=

bring slowly to the boil and simmer gently until the onions are soft.
Pass through a hair sieve, and dilute with milk.

bread, the cauliflower water, and half the milk, and boil slowly for
an hour. Take it off the fire, pass it through a sieve, add the rest

beaten together, and the salt and pepper. Gradually add milk, which

improvement in some cases.

out on a flat dish not quite half an inch thick, and allow it to get
quite cold. Then divide into fillet-shaped pieces, brush over with the
beaten white of egg, toss in fine breadcrumbs, and fry in plenty of
smoking-hot fat. Drain, and serve very hot, garnished with slices of

set well. Pour into dish to stiffen, and when quite cold cut into

salt. Stir over a slow fire for a few minutes; then add 2-ozs. flour,

hard boiled egg, 1 teacupful tapioca (soaked overnight), some short
crust pastry.

drops of lemon juice. Roll the mixture on a floured board until about
1/2-inch thick, shape into cutlets, roll in egg, then in crumbs and fry.
As Protose does not require previous cooking this is a very quickly
prepared dish, and if a few tins are kept in stock it is always handy
for emergencies. The cutlets may be fried without egg and breadcrumbs,
simply rolled in a little flour, if one is very pressed for time.
Serve with tomato or onion sauce, or a rich gravy.

breadcrumbs, adding chopped lemon thyme, lemon peel and parsley, some
pepper and salt, and 1 egg to bind; fry very brown. Cut up the Nuttose

mashed potatoes placed round the outside of the dish. It is also nice
served as follows, viz.:--Prepare as for minced meat. Boil a cupful of
rice as for curry. When cooked stir in one teaspoonful of tomato sauce
and seasoning. Put the mince in the centre of the dish with a wall of
the rice and tomato round it.


=56. Lentil and Potato Sausages.=

Boil 5-ozs. lentils in very little water, so that when cooked all
water is absorbed, then add 1 chopped and fried onion, a tiny pinch of

Peel two dozen chestnuts and stew gently in vegetable stock until
nearly soft. Now remove half the chestnuts, and continue to cook the
remainder until quite soft, gradually reducing the stock. Mash the

breadcrumbs, 2-ozs. of butter, pepper and salt, 1 egg, and lastly the
partly cooked chestnuts, cut into neat pieces. Well grease a basin or
mould, pour in the mixture and steam three-quarters of an hour, and

filling mixture is made just as for the Nut-Meat Rissoles (52), with

Almonds can be used if preferred, and curry powder instead of
preserve, if they are preferred savoury instead of sweet.


=147. Tomato or Egg Sandwiches.=

Put a good breakfastcupful of brown beans, with a few onions, into a
brown stew-jar, and cover with a quart, or rather more, of water.
Place in a slow oven and cook until the beans crack, and the liquid
will then have become a rich brown colour. After the liquid has been
poured from the beans (to be used as stock or for haricot tea) rub
them through a sieve or masher. To 7-ozs. of the pulp, add 3-ozs.
mashed potato, 3-ozs. brown breadcrumbs, and 1-1/2-ozs. butter; salt,
pepper, nutmeg and mace to taste, and a little fried onion if liked.

well-greased pie dish with the stuffing, then press into the middle a
tin of Protose (minced or machined). Thickly cover over with stuffing.
Put little pieces of butter or nucoline on top, cover with a tin and
bake in slow oven an hour or an hour and a half. This makes a savoury
dish, when cold, with a good salad.


=154. Potted Tomato Paste.=

Three tomatoes, 1 egg, 2-ozs. grated cheese, 4-ozs. breadcrumbs, 1/2-oz.

olive oil and cream, until the mixture is quite smooth. Then rub the
yolk of a hard-boiled egg in the paste, and keep it free from lumps.
Pour in a dessertspoonful of vinegar, stirring slowly all the time.
Add a teacupful of rich milk or some cream. Serve.




=GRAVIES AND SAUCES.=


A great variety of savoury and nutritious gravies can be made from
vegetable stock, with the usual thickening, (arrowroot is best), a
pinch of salt and pepper, seasoning, and a lump of butter. Brown
haricot broth is the best stock (Recipe 5). The addition of Nutril,
Wintox, Mapleton's Gravy Essence, or Marmite gives flavour and
increases the nourishing quality.

It is very desirable that the gravy or sauce served with certain
vegetarian dishes should be piquante in taste and of a nice flavour.
It is worth while to take some trouble to achieve this result, because
many dishes that are plain and perhaps somewhat tasteless in
themselves are made quite savoury and enjoyable by the addition of a
piquante dressing. Brand's A1 sauce is a good example of such
piquancy, and is also useful in making sauces in the home, as a few
teaspoons of it will often give an unique flavour to a simple gravy
that is lacking in this respect.


=157. Walnut Gravy.=

Take about 4-ozs. of shelled walnuts, put them through the nut mill,
and place in a small pan in which you have previously made hot 1-oz.
of butter. Fry until the walnut is dark brown, _stirring well_ all the
time to prevent burning. Pour on a pint of stock, or water if no stock
is at hand, and let it simmer slowly until just before serving. Then
add 1-oz. of flour to thicken, some seasoning, and a few drops of
onion or some tomato sauce. This makes a most rich and savoury
gravy--especially if a little nut-butter is added.


=158. Curry Gravy.=

In the cold weather, dishes which contain curry are seasonable and are
generally appreciated. The following recipe for a curry gravy will
prove useful to many readers, as it makes a capital addition to plain
boiled rice or many other dishes. Fry 2 onions, minced in some butter
until they are quite brown. Then sift in some flour and let it brown
also. Add slowly some vegetable stock or water, two minced apples, a
teaspoonful of curry paste (Stembridge's is good), a teaspoonful of
vinegar, and a dessertspoonful each of tomato sauce and chutney. Stir
and serve.


=159. Gravy Piquante.=

Stew a dozen shallots in some butter until soft. Stir in some flour

stock or water, boil for 15 minutes and strain.


=160. Plain Brown Gravy.=

Melt some butter until brown, add flour (previously mixed well in a
little water), and some vegetable stock, dilute if necessary and

the flavour and richness. The addition of Vegeton, Nutril or Marmite
improves this.

thicken with arrowroot, boil and strain.

tablespoonful of flour, and keep stirring until you get a rich dark
brown, being careful not to burn; now add slowly some stock made by
stewing brown haricot beans, and simmer slowly for about 20 minutes.
At serving time, add a good teaspoonful of Nutril, Wintox or Marmite.


=163. Tarragon Sauce.=

Melt 1-oz. of butter, stir in 1/2-oz. of flour until free from lumps,
add 1/4-pt. of milk and stir until it boils. Finally add 20 or 30 drops
of Tarragon vinegar. This sauce is an excellent addition to
cauliflower, and the flavour is unique.


=164. Parsley Sauce.=

Make in same way as in the above recipe, but substitute a large
teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley for the vinegar.

a large lemon and 2 teaspoons of Tarragon vinegar. Whisk the white of

3-pts. vinegar. The whole to be boiled for 3 hours. Pour into
stoppered bottles. This makes a most excellent chutney.


=170. Coconut Sauce.=

add 1/2-pt. of cold water and 1/2-pt. of milk, half at a time; stir in

Place some biscuit crumbs in a buttered pie dish. Nearly fill it with
stewed apples. Beat an egg with 1/4-pt. of milk and pour over the
apples. Place some small ratafia biscuits on the top and some grated
nutmeg. Bake in a moderate oven.


=202. Sultana Custard Pudding.=

To 2-ozs. of Robinson's Patent Barley, add 1-oz. of sifted sugar,
1/2-oz. of butter, a pinch of salt, and nearly 1-pt. of milk; mix
thoroughly and stir it over the fire till it boils; then add a yolk
of egg, 3-ozs. sultanas, and bake the pudding in a buttered pie-dish.


=203. Swiss Roll.=

Take 3-ozs. castor sugar and 1 teacupful flour, and add to them 1
teaspoonful of baking powder. Separate the yolks from the whites of 2
eggs, and beat the latter till stiff. Add 1 tablespoon of milk to the
yolks, and work into the flour and sugar, then add the stiffly beaten
whites. Beat all well with a wooden spoon. Pour on to a greased
Yorkshire pudding tin, and bake in a very sharp oven for seven
minutes. Then turn on to a piece of kitchen paper dredged with castor
sugar. Spread quickly with jam (which has been thoroughly beaten) and
roll with the paper. Place on a sieve till cool.


=204. Gateau aux Fruits.=

Take half a tinned pineapple, 3 bananas, 1/4-lb. grapes, 4 Tangarine
oranges, and the juice of a lemon. Cut up the fruit into dice,
sprinkle with sugar and pour over them half the pineapple syrup, the
lemon juice, and a tablespoonful of maraschino, and leave for an hour
to soak. Split five stale sponge cakes open, cut each half into three
fingers and spread each rather thickly with apricot jam. Place four of
these strips on a glass dish so as to form a square, and put four more
across the corners so as to form a diamond in it, and so on, square
and diamond alternately. Fill the middle of the tower thus formed with
the macedoine of fruits, piling them high above the top, and pour the
rest of the pineapple syrup over the cake. Whip half a pint of cream
stiffly, and put it (or Coconut Cream, 224) on in rough spoonfuls all
over the tower.


=205. Poached Apricots.=

Upon some slices of sponge cake, place half an apricot (round side
uppermost). Whip some white of egg to a snow frost with castor sugar.
Place this round the apricot so as to make it resemble a poached egg.
Whipped cream is preferable to many persons if obtainable. The sponge
should be slightly moistened with the apricot juice.


=206. Lemon Sponge.=

Dissolve 1/2-oz. of leaf gelatine in 1/2-pt. of water and add the rind of
a lemon and 1-oz. castor sugar. Strain the juice of a lemon on to the
white of an egg, then strain the dissolved gelatine on to it. Whisk
all together till it makes quite a stiff froth. Turn into a mould, and
take out when set.


=207. Plasmon Snow-Cream.=

Put 3 heaped teaspoonfuls (1-3/4-ozs.) of Plasmon into a bowl. From
1/2-pt. of tepid water take 4 tablespoons and mix it with the powder,
rubbing it into a paste. Slowly add the remainder of the water; stir
thoroughly, then place in a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring
all the time. Stand aside to get quite cold. When required for use,
whisk it into a thick snow-cream. This makes a splendid addition to
stewed fruit (peaches, &c.), cocoa, coffee, or puddings. It is most
nutritious also. The proportions must be correct to get the cream
_firm_ as well as _light_. If it is _frothy_ there is too much water;
if sticky and heavy there is not sufficient water.


=208. Rice and Sultana Padding.=

To an ordinary rice pudding add 4-ozs. of sultanas. Bake in a slow
oven for several hours, with plenty of milk. When cooked it should be
brown in colour and quite moist. It is easily digested and makes a
good supper dish.


=209. Plain Boiled Pudding.=

Take 2-ozs. of Nutter, 4-ozs. each of white and brown flour, and
4-ozs. of breadcrumbs. Add water gradually, mixing into a dry dough,
and boil in a cloth for an hour and a half.


=210. Apple Fritters.=

Peel and quarter, or finely mince, some good cooking apples, dip in
batter made as follows:--1 tablespoonful flour, 1 egg well beaten,
enough milk to make it the consistency of cream. Fry crisp, and
serve.


=211. Empress Pudding.=

Take 1-pt. of breadcrumbs, 1-qt. of new milk, the yolks of 4 eggs
(well beaten), the grated rind of a lemon, and 3-ozs. of butter; mix
and bake about half an hour. When cold, spread some raspberry or plum
jam over the pudding, then whip the whites of the eggs with a teacup
of sifted sugar and the juice of a lemon, and lay this over the jam.
Make slightly brown in the oven.


=212. Orange Jelly.=

Wipe and thickly peel 5 oranges and 2 lemons, take 1-pt. of cold
water, 1/2-lb. white sugar, and 1-1/2-ozs. cornflour. Place the peel and
water in a pan and simmer for 20 minutes with the sugar; strain the
resulting juice. Place the cornflour in a basin and squeeze the juice
of the fruit through a strainer on to it, then pour the boiling syrup
on to this mixture; stir well, return to saucepan, and boil for 6
minutes. Pour out into cold wet mould. Garnish with orange.


=213. Ginger Pudding.=

Take 6-ozs. of brown breadcrumbs (finely grated), 3-ozs. of butter, a
saltspoonful of ground ginger, the juice of a lemon, and 4-ozs. of
castor sugar. Stir these in a stewpan until the butter is melted. Chop
4-ozs. of preserved ginger and add to the mixture with the yolks of 2
eggs. Beat well together and set aside to cool. Whisk the whites of
the eggs and stir into the pudding quickly. Fill a buttered basin with
it, cover with a saucer (leaving room to swell) and steam for 3 hours.
Serve with cream or fruit sauce (177).


=214. Baked Coconut Custard.=

Beat 3 eggs and mix with 1-1/2-pts. of milk, add 2 tablespoons of
desiccated coconut, and a tablespoonful of sugar. Bake in a slow oven,
and add some grated nutmeg.


=215. Semolina Pudding.=

Boil a teacupful of semolina for 15 minutes in 2-1/2 pts. of milk,
stirring all the time. Flavour with vanilla. Turn out into a buttered
pie dish, garnish with ratafia biscuits and bake in a moderate oven.


=216. Strawberry Cream Ice.=

Take 1-1/2-lbs. of ripe strawberries, 6-ozs. of castor sugar, 1/2-lb. of
cream and a teacupful of milk. Put the strawberries through a sieve or
strainer, mix the whole well together, and freeze.

Raspberry ice can be made in a simpler form by reducing the cream by
one-half and by adding another teacupful of milk in which a
dessertspoonful of cornflour has been boiled.


=217. Vanilla Ice.=

Take 1 pint of milk, 1 gill of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs, and 3-ozs.
of castor sugar. After heating the milk, mix 1/2-oz. of ground rice with
a little cold milk and put it in the saucepan. Pour in the beaten
yolks and cream, and the sugar; stir and simmer until the custard
thickens, strain and set aside to cool; add vanilla to taste, and stir
well; place in the freezing machine. To make this ice taste richer and
more delicate, reduce the milk and increase the cream.


=218. Lemon Cheese-Cakes.=

Put in a saucepan 1/4-lb. butter, 1-lb. lump sugar, 6 eggs (leaving out
2 whites), 2 grated lemon rinds, and the juice of 3 lemons. Simmer
until all is dissolved (gently stirring), and add a few dry biscuit
crumbs. Serve on crisp pastry.


=219. Lemon Jelly.=

Dissolve 1-oz. of isinglass in 1-1/4-pts. of water. Add the grated peel
of 2 lemons and 1/2-lb. of lump sugar. Boil for 10 minutes, stirring
continually. Take off fire and add the juice of 1-1/2 lemons. Strain and
cool. Whisk well before turning into moulds.


=220. Fruitarian Mincemeat.=

Take 7-ozs. Nutter, 12-ozs. raisins, 6-ozs. sultanas, 6-ozs. currants,
1/4-lb. Demerara sugar, 1-1/2-lbs. apples, 1/4-lb. mixed candied peel, the
rind and juice of 1 lemon, 6 almonds, 6 Brazil nuts, a few drops
ratafia flavouring essence, and 3 teaspoons of mixed spice. Stone the
rasins, finely chop all the fruit, and put the nuts and almonds
through the nut mill. Now melt the Nutter in a saucepan, and gradually
add all the other ingredients, stirring well, leave standing over
night, and put in pots next morning. Cover closely, and this will keep
a long time.


=221. Short Pastry.=

Rub 1/2-lb. Nutter into 1-lb. flour and 2-ozs. Artox wholemeal, mix as
dry as possible with water, and it is ready to make excellent
biscuits, short cakes, or tart crusts. If whiter pastry is required
use white flour.


=222. Puff Pastry.=

Ingredients:--1-lb. flour, 3/4-lb. Nutter, cold water. Method:--Rub
1/4-lb. Nutter into the flour, mix to a rough dough with cold water,
stand in a cool place for ten minutes. Roll out and "spot" over with
1/4-lb. Nutter broken in small pieces; fold over, roll out and stand 10
minutes. Roll out again and spot over with the remaining 1/4-lb. Nutter;
fold over and roll out, and after standing 10 minutes it is ready for
use.


=223. Chestnut Cream.=

Take from 20 to 30 chestnuts, remove the shells and skins. Put the
chestnuts in a saucepan with 2 teacups full of water, sugar to taste,
the juice of 1 lemon, and simmer slowly until they are quite soft.
Pass through a sieve or potato masher, and when cold pile in a dish,
and cover with whipped cream.


=224. Coconut Cream.=

A nice addition to Trifles, Fruit Salads, etc., can be made by using
Mapleton's Coconut Cream. Mix 2 ozs. of the cream with 1/8-pt. of
boiling water; when softened beat for a minute or so with the
egg-beater, then pour on a dish. In 2 hours it will have set and can
be used to fill sponge sandwiches, or eaten with stewed fruit. To form
a thick cream (less solid) beat up 2-1/2 to 3 ozs. Coconut Cream with
1/4-pt. of hot water.




=THE BREAD PROBLEM.=


Pure wholemeal bread, so made as to be light and well baked, is a
virtual necessity for every abstainer from flesh-food. Food-Reform
presents many difficulties, and every dietetic reformer has to grapple
with them. Insufficient knowledge, defective sources of provision,
digestive troubles, inherited organic weakness, and unfavourable
environment, are only a few of these. I want, therefore to emphasize
the importance of a perfect bread supply, which I am convinced is the
key to the problem so far as many are concerned.

It is not sufficient merely to pray for "our daily bread," and then to
leave its provision entirely to Providence. We need also to _think_
and to take some personal trouble about it--remembering that Heaven
helps those who help themselves. Yet this is what very few people do.
One may safely affirm that four persons out of every five are content
to use defective and innutritious bread every day of their lives. Yet
this should be made a real staff of life.

The whole grain of wheat, if of good quality, contains nearly all that
is needful for the perfect nutrition of the body. With the addition of
a small amount of fat (easily found in nut or dairy butter, cheese or
oil), and of grape sugar and purifying acids (obtainable in fruits),
pure wheatmeal, if properly ground in stone mills, and well made into
delicious home-baked bread, enables one to be almost independent of
other foods, and therefore almost ensures one against a breakdown in
health if there is difficulty in obtaining a varied and well
proportioned dietary from other sources.

Instead of securing and using bread such as this, the majority of the
community complacently eat white bread--emasculated, robbed of its
gluten (which is equivalent to albumen) and of the phosphates and
mineral salts that are stored in the inner part of the husk of the
grain. It is composed almost entirely of starch, with the addition of
such adulterants as the baker or miller feels inclined to introduce
for commercial reasons, and is not conducive to the proper operation
of the digestive and eliminative organs.

It is difficult for bakers or the public to buy really good wholemeal.
The meal that is on the markets often consists of cheap roller-milled
flour with some sweepings of bran or seconds thrown in. And even if
the entire grain is supplied, the outer cuticle of the wheat, when
_rolled_ (in the modern steel-roller mills that for reasons of economy
have superseded the good old-fashioned stone _grinding_ mills),
instead of being so reduced as to be capable of complete digestion, is
left with rough edges called _spiculae_, which irritate the digestive
tract, cause relaxation, and arouse prejudice against the 'brown'
loaf. Such wholemeal cannot be perfectly assimilated because the bran
is not properly broken up, and, in addition to this fact, the
cerealine, which acts like diastase in the conversion of starch into
sugar, is not liberated and rendered available as an aid to
digestion.

That the distasteful and often indigestible brown or wholemeal bread
(so-called) usually sold by bakers is either defective or adulterated,
can easily be proven by anyone. Let any reader procure some
stone-milled entire wheatmeal that is guaranteed pure (I use the
'Artox' and 'Ixion' brands myself, because I believe them to be of
genuine quality and properly stone-ground); then make some thin loaves
as described in the following recipe. The result, if the bread is
skilfully made, will be a delicious and nutritive loaf of the
farmhouse type with a sweet nutty flavour. Instead of quickly getting
'stale,' such a loaf is enjoyable when four days old, and it only
needs to be compared with ordinary bakers' bread to reveal the fact
that it is an entirely different article of food. Its sustaining power
is wonderful, and it proves an effectual preventive of starved nerves
as well as other ailments.


=225. How to make Wholemeal Bread.=

The yeast must be quite fresh, and the bread should be raised in
separate tins _in a warm place or cupboard_; the oven must be hot at
first, but the heat should be much reduced after 10 minutes. Mix
6-lbs. of wholemeal with 1-lb. of household flour. Then mix 3-ozs. of
_fresh_ yeast with a tablespoon of treacle, adding 2 tablespoons of
olive oil when it is quite dissolved. Put this into the flour with
about 2-pts. of lukewarm water. Mix it with a wooden spoon till it
does not stick. Knead for 10 minutes, adding more water if necessary
but keeping the dough firm and spongy. Put it into flat baking tins
(well greased) about 2-1/2 inches deep, covering the tins to the depth
of about 1 inch only. Let it rise for 1 hour, or till it reaches the
tops of the tins. Then bake first in a quick oven, and afterwards in a
slower. A gas oven is most reliable for baking bread, as the heat is
more easily regulated. The bread should be a rich dark golden brown
when well baked.


=226. White Bread.=

Make as Recipe 225, but substitute household flour for wholemeal. The
shape and size of the loaves should be changed occasionally. Loaves
baked in _small_ tins are often lighter than bread made into large
loaves.


=227. Plain Currant Bread and Buns.=

To 2-lbs. of good wholemeal or white flour add a pinch of salt, 1
tablespoonful of sugar, and 1/2-lb. of currants or sultanas; also rub in
2-ozs. of olive oil or nut-margarine. Mix 1-oz. of yeast with a little
golden syrup and add lukewarm water. Stir this into the flour, and add
sufficient warm water to make a nice dough. Shape into loaves or
little buns, set to rise for 1 hour or longer, then bake in a quick
oven and brush with egg and milk.


=228. Dinner Rolls.=

Delicious dinner rolls can be made as follows:--Take 1-lb. of white
flour, 1-lb. of wholemeal, 3-ozs. butter, and 1-oz. of yeast. Mix the
yeast with a dessertspoonful of treacle, 3/4-pt. of milk and water. Rub
the butter into the flour, and put in the yeast to rise. Knead, form
into small rolls, raise for half-an-hour, bake in a quick oven.


=229. Sultana Cake.=

Sift into 1/2-lb. of flour 1 teaspoonful of baking powder. Grate the
rind of a lemon on to an egg and beat it well. Cream together 3-ozs.
nut-margarine and 3-ozs. sugar; add the egg, beating still, then stir
in lightly the flour and 3-ozs. sultanas; add milk to make a soft
dough. Pour into a well-buttered cake tin, put in a hot oven, and bake
for about half-an-hour, reducing the temperature considerably.


=230. Sultana Rice Cake.=

Put 3-ozs. of Nut-margarine in a warm oven. Grate the rind of a lemon
on to an egg and 3-ozs. of castor sugar, beat well, then add the
warmed Nutter and beat again till it is creamy. Now sift together
5-ozs. of ground rice, 3-ozs. of flour and 1 teaspoonful of baking
powder. Beat this gently into the mixture, add 4-ozs. sultanas and
enough milk to make a proper consistency. Put in a hot oven, gradually
reducing the temperature, and bake for about 3/4 of an hour.


=231. Cheese Straws.=

Mix 6-ozs. flour and 6-ozs. grated cheese well together, then rub in
2-ozs. butter, add a little cayenne pepper and salt, bind with the
yolk of an egg, roll out about a quarter of a inch thick, cut into
long narrow fingers, and bake in a sharp oven for 10 minutes.


=232. Sultana Bun Cakes.=

Sift together 8-ozs. of flour, 3-ozs. Paisley flour and 2-ozs. of
sugar; rub in 4-ozs. olive oil, and add 4-ozs. of sultanas. Mix all
with a well beaten egg and a little milk, roll out, shape with a
cutter and bake at once in a quick oven.




=SUMMER AND WINTER DRINKS.=


The following recipes and suggestions concerning a few beverages which
can be used as substitutes for more stimulating drinks may prove
useful to many readers:--


=233. Barley Water.=

Mix a tablespoonful of Pearl Barley with a pint of water and boil for
half-an-hour. Flavour with lemon, cinnamon or sugar, according to
taste, and allow the mixture to cool. For invalids requiring nutriment
a larger quantity of barley should be used.

Barley Water is equally suitable for winter use and can be taken hot.


=234. Wheatenade.=

Simmer 1-lb. of crushed wheat in 1-qt. of water for about an hour,
stirring it occasionally. Strain, add lemon juice and sugar to taste,
for use in summer, or milk and sugar if the drink is taken hot in
winter. Good and clean bran can be substituted for crushed wheat. This
is a capital drink for children with a tendency to rickets, or for
persons suffering from nervous prostration caused by malnutrition.


=235. Oatenade.=

Simmer 1/4-lb. of coarse oatmeal in the same manner as described in the
previous recipe, then flavour to taste. This drink will be slightly
richer in fat than the previous one, and it makes a good winter
drink.


=236. Gingerade.=

Take 1-dr. essence cayenne, 4-drs. essence of ginger, 2-drs. essence
of lemon, 1-dr. burnt sugar, 3/4-oz. of tartaric acid. Add 3-lbs. lump
sugar and 5-qts. boiling water. Bottle ready for use. Dilute to taste.


=237. Fruit Drink.=

Lime juice, if pure, makes a cooling and wholesome drink. The
"Montserrat" is one of the purest brands upon the market; some of the
liquid sold as lime juice is only a chemical concoction. The weaker
the solution the better it tastes. A dessertspoonful to the tumbler is
generally enough. Dole's Pineapple juice is also an excellent fruit
drink.


=238. Rice Water.=

Boil some once-milled rice in water, and add lemon juice and sugar to
taste. The beverage should not be made too thick. As rice is often
used in most households a supply of this nutritious drink is easily
provided. It is very good for children.


=Tea and Coffee Substitutes.=

Those who find tea and coffee undesirable should try "Wallace P. R.
Coffee," "Lifebelt Coffee," "Salfon," or "Horlick's Malted Milk."
Another good substitute is "Hygiama," which, unlike tea and coffee, is
not a stimulant, but a nutrient. On the other hand its effect on the
system is distinctly stimulating in a right and healthy sense. That is
to say, the valuable nourishment which it contains is very easily and
quickly digested and an immediate sense of invigoration is the result.
Unlike cocoa, it is not clogging or constipating or heavy.




=HOW TO FEED INVALIDS.=


In all cases of sickness the patient will have a better chance of
recovery if the diet is light and wisely selected.

[Illustration]

When inflammation and fever exist, fruit and cooling drinks should be
given, and but little nitrogenous food.

An eminent physician writes thus: "The fever patient, like the over
worked man, digests badly. He has no appetite; his salivary glands do
not secrete, or secrete very imperfectly. The gastric juice formed
under bad conditions is almost inert, poor in pepsine and hydrocloric
acid. The liver no longer acts if the fever is high and serious; the
intestinal secretions are partially exhausted.... The fever patient
must then be fed very little."

When the hydrocloric acid is deficient, proteid food should be given
very sparingly--one of the best forms being Casumen in solution (see
224) or white of egg. Milk is not advisable in such a condition,
unless malted, or in the dried form. Fats are objectionable, and if
the salivary secretions are defective, starches should be given in
dextrinized (super-cooked) form, or well toasted. Fruit sugars, which
are Carbohydrates in a digested form, are better still, and may be
given freely to patients of nearly all kinds. They are abundantly
provided in figs, dates, stoneless raisins and sultanas, and in other
sweet fruits, such as bananas, strawberries and apples.

Ample nourishment can be provided by these, supplemented by egg dishes
(chiefly white); flaked and super-cooked cereals, such as Granose
Biscuits, Kellogg Wheat Flakes, Wallace P. R. and Flakit Biscuits,
Archeva Rusks, Melarvi Crisps, and toasted or wholemeal bread; flaked
or malted nuts; legumes souffle; well-cooked farinaceous puddings;
Horlick's Malted Milk and many other proprietary health-foods; and
vegetable broths--for which see Recipes 1-23, as well as those which
conclude this section on pages 123 and 124.

One of the most important of these latter is 'Haricot Broth,' which is
a perfect substitute for "beef tea," being far more nutritious and
also free from the toxic elements which are contained in that
dangerous and superstitiously venerated compound.

[Sidenote: =The Beef Tea Delusion.=]

Dr. Milner Fothergill stated that probably more invalids have sunk
into their graves through a misplaced confidence in the value of beef
tea than Napoleon killed in all his wars. It is, in reality, a strong
solution of waste products and of uric acid, consisting largely of
excrementitious matter which was in process of elimination from the
system of some animal, through the minute drain pipes which form an
important cleansing medium or "sewage system" in all animal flesh. To
make "beef tea," these poisonous substances are stewed out to form
the decoction, while the animal fibrin, the portion of the meat that
has some nutritive value, is thrown away.

Beef tea consequently acts as a strong stimulant, tends to increase
inflammation and fever, and in all such cases lessens the chance of
the patient's recovery, as the system is already battling against
toxic elements in the blood. To add to the amount of the latter is
obviously unwise and dangerous. These remarks apply also to 'meat
essences' and to 'beef extracts,' which are frequently made from
diseased flesh which has been condemned in the slaughterhouses.

Meals provided for invalids should be very simple, but served in a
very dainty manner. A spotless serviette and tray cloth, bright
silver, a bunch of flowers and a ribbon to match them in colour for
tying the serviette (the colour of which can be changed from day to
day) should not be forgotten. The food should be supplied in small
quantities; half a cupful of broth will often be taken when a cupful
would be sent away untouched, and the wishes of the patient should be
respected so far as it is safe and wise to do so. It is also a good
plan to serve two or three small separate courses, rather than to put
everything that is provided on a tray together.

Stewed French plums and figs are valuable in the sickroom because of
their laxative effects, and dainty sandwiches will be found acceptable
by most invalids--made with flaked nuts and honey, dried milk
(Lacvitum), potted meat, etc.

[Sidenote: =Don't Overfeed Invalids.=]

One of the greatest evils to be avoided by those who are nursing the
sick is that of over-feeding. When nature is doing her best to meet a
crisis, or to rid the body of microbes or impurities, it is a mistake
to cause waste of vital energy by necessitating the expulsion of
superfluous alimentary matter. Invalids should not be unduly persuaded
to take food. The stomach generally requires _rest_, and is often in
such a condition that digestion is impossible.

Much of the suffering and inconvenience endured by sick persons is
simply the result of erroneous diet. Judicious feeding will do far
more than drugs to alleviate and cure most maladies, in fact drugs and
stimulants are seldom required. The great healing agent is the
Life-force within--the "_Vis medicatrix Naturae_"--and the wise
physician will see that this power has a fair chance. He will
encourage hopeful mental influence, and advocate pure air, pure food,
and pure water, combined with a cessation of any physical
transgression which has been the _cause_ of the malady in question.

Care should be exercised lest invalids partake too freely of starch
foods, especially if such are insufficiently cooked. Wholemeal bread
should be _light_ and _well baked_, and in most cases it will be more
easily assimilated if toasted. Granose and other similar biscuits
(which consist of entire wheatmeal in a super-cooked form, so that the
starch is already transformed into 'dextrin') will be easily
digestible and are slightly laxative in their effect. They are just
the right thing to be taken with broth or soup or porridge. The
following recipes will be found helpful.


=239. Brown Haricot Broth.=

(A perfect substitute for 'Beef Tea.')

Take 1/2-lb. of brown haricot beans. Wash and stew them with 1-qt. of
hot water and some small onions for 3 hours, stewing down to 1-pt.
Strain, and add pepper, celery-salt and butter when serving. This bean
tea or broth, so prepared, will be found to be very savoury and of the
same taste and appearance as beef tea, while being much richer in
nutriment.


=240. Mock Chicken Broth.=

A valuable substitute for chicken broth, which is in every way
superior to the decoction obtained by stewing the flesh and bones of
the bird, can be made by stewing and serving white haricots in the
same manner as in the previous recipe.


=241. Hygiama Apple Puree.=

Select two or three sound ripe apples, wash and rub in hot water,
remove core and all bruised or dark parts, but not the peel, cut in
small pieces, place in a covered jar or casserole with a cupful of
water, or sufficient to prevent burning. Cook gently until apples are
soft; then rub all through a fine sieve. Mix a tablespoonful or more
of Hygiama with just enough water to form a paste, mix this paste into
the apple, with just a touch of cinnamon or nutmeg if liked, and serve
with pieces of dry toast, twice-baked bread or rusks.


=242. Oat Cream.=

A most excellent recipe for invalids and anaemic patients is prescribed
by Dr. Oldfield, as follows: Boil 1 pint milk, sift into it a large
handful of crushed oats. Simmer until it is thick as raw cream. Strain
and serve; the patient to take 1/2-pint, sucking it through a straw
slowly.


=243. Linseed Tea.=

Few persons realize the good qualities of linseed tea. It is useful
for weak, anaemic and delicate persons; it produces flesh, is soothing
in bronchial cases, and laxative. If made thin, and flavoured with
lemon, it is quite palatable, and many persons get fond of it. The
seed should be whole and of best quality, and it only requires stewing
until the liquor is of the consistency of thin gruel.


=244. proteid Gruel.=

A good liquid food can be quickly made by warming a dessertspoonful of
"Emprote" or "Malted Nuts" in a glass of milk, and flavouring to
taste. A large teaspoonful of "Casumen" (pure milk proteid) dissolved
in a breakfastcup of barley water, coffee, or vegetable soup, also
readily provides much nutriment in a simple form.


=245. Lentil Gruel.=

This is a useful and nutritious food for invalids. To make the gruel,
take a dessertspoonful of lentil flour, mixed smooth in some cold
milk, add nearly 1-pt. of milk which has been brought to the boil.
Boil for 15 minutes and flavour with a little cinnamon or vanilla.
Serve with toast. This is the same as the much prescribed "Revalenta
Arabica" food, but the lentil flour, without a long scientific name,
only costs 3d. a pound, instead of half-a-crown.


=246. Malted Milk Prune Whip.=

One cup of prunes, 2 tablespoonfuls Horlick's Malted Milk, 1
tablespoonful sugar, lemon sufficient to flavour, white of egg. Wash
well, and soak the prunes until tender. Boil with small piece of lemon
until soft. Add sugar, remove stones, rub through colander; add the
Horlick's Malted Milk, beat well; add the white of egg, well beaten.
Cool, and serve with whipped cream. Flavour with vanilla if desired.


=247. Malted Milk Jelly.=

Phosphated gelatine 1 teaspoonful, Horlick's Malted Milk 2 to 4
teaspoonfuls, sugar and flavouring to suit. Soak the gelatine in cold
water for 1 hour, then dissolve in just sufficient hot water. Add the
Horlick's Malted Milk dissolved in 2 cups of hot water, and sweeten
and flavour to taste.


=248. Malted Milk with Iced Fruit.=

Take of Horlick's Malted Milk 1 heaped teaspoonful, crushed fruit 1
tablespoonful, crushed ice 1 tablespoonful, 1 egg, acid phosphate
twenty drops, grated nutmeg to flavour, water to make a cup. Mix the
Malted Milk, crushed fruit and egg, beating the same for five minutes.
Add the phosphate and crushed ice, stirring all for several minutes.
Strain, and add ice-cold water or cold carbonated water, and grated
nutmeg to flavour.


=249. Effervescent Malted Milk.=

Put some finely cracked ice into a glass. Fill it half full of soda,
Vichy or Syphon water, and immediately add the desired amount of
Horlick's Malted Milk in solution. Drink while effervescing. Brandy
may be added if necessary.




=WHAT TO DO AT CHRISTMAS.=


[Illustration]

The Christmas festival--which has degenerated into such a deplorable
orgy of massacre and over-feeding in many countries which are called
'Christian'--can be observed and enjoyed without such barbarities and
butchery as now take place.

How can we consistently sing and talk of 'Peace on Earth' when we are
participating in ruthless warfare against the animal creation?

Is not this wholesale and cruel slaughter altogether discordant with
the spirit and doctrine of the gentle and harmless Teacher of
Nazareth, whose terrestrial birth is thus celebrated by pagan
barbarity? Should not those of us who dare to call ourselves His
followers protest against a custom which brings discredit upon His
religion and causes humanely disposed Oriental nations to regard it
almost with contempt?

The following suggestive Menu will at once show my readers that
Christmas can be celebrated with a feast of good things without such
butchery. And many are they who have found that its joys can even be
enhanced by a sense of freedom from blood-guiltiness and personal
responsibility concerning the deeds that are done in the shambles at
this time of 'Peace and Goodwill.'

The Menu can be varied as taste and circumstances may dictate.


=A Bloodless Menu for Christmas.=

_From which a selection can be made._

    Mock Turtle Soup (4).
      _Fried Bread Dice._
     Julienne Soup (9).
      _Granose Biscuits._
    Mock Scallop Oysters (24).
    Mock White Fish (32).
      _Parsley Sauce._
    Savoury Nut Steaks (50).
    Macaroni Rissoles (68).
      _Sauce Piquante._
    Yorkshire Pudding.
    Potato Puree (109).
    Cauliflowers.
    Baked Stuffed Tomatoes (104).
    Chestnut or Vegetable Souffle (94 or 97).
    Plum Pudding (178).
    Stewed Pears.
      _Clotted Cream._
    Mince Pies (220).
    Fresh Fruits.
    Almonds and Muscatels.
    Figs.
    Dates.
    Preserved Ginger.


The cost of such a dinner as this will be much less than that of a
corresponding one which includes poultry, game, and joints of flesh.
The amount saved could be appropriately expended in providing a few
comforts for the poor and needy--thus the Christmas festival provides
an opportunity for lessening the suffering in this world, and also for
increasing the sum of human happiness.

=Hints to Housekeepers.=


A few simple hints to those who are trying the vegetarian recipes in
this book may be useful.

Cooking utensils should be kept quite separate from those used for
meat, fish or fowl.

Nut-oil or nut-butter should always be used for frying, and the right
heat is known when a slight blue haze rises above the pan, or by
dipping a finger of bread in the oil, when if hot enough it will at
once fry brown and crisp. After frying it is always best to place the
articles fried on some folded tissue paper to drain out the frying
oil.

Marmite, Nutril and Carnos make good additions to stock for flavouring
soups and gravies.

In this kind of cookery there is no waste, all the food is edible and
anything that remains over from dishes can be put together and made
into curries, stews, cottage pie, etc., etc.

Excellent Salads can be made by the addition of uncooked scraped and
sliced carrots and beetroot; and also by chopping up very finely
celery, Brussels sprouts, French beans, green peas, cabbage, parsley,
onions, etc. The bright colours of these raw vegetables are most
useful in decorating galantines and other cold dishes, and when
arranged with regard to colour, make a most artistic garnishing and
are most wholesome.

Pea nuts, pine kernels, and hazel nuts are much improved in flavour by
being put in a baking pan in the oven until slightly browned.

Lemon juice is a good substitute for vinegar in all sauces.

For making a smooth soup it is a good plan to rub the vegetables after
they are cooked through a very fine hair sieve.

In making cutlets a stick of macaroni should be inserted in the thin
end of the cutlet to represent a bone, it may be fried or not with the
cutlet.

From several years' experience I have found the non-flesh cookery is
most economical, the expense being less than half that of the
corresponding meat dishes.

    =Margaret Carey=




=UNFIRED AND VITAL FOODS.=


The following practical information and suggestions will be found
helpful by those who wish to test the advantages of living solely upon
uncooked foods--as now recommended by so many progressive physicians,
dietetic specialists, and teachers of hygiene. Although such a
strictly simple and natural dietary may at first involve some
gustatory self-denial, the benefits resulting from its use are
declared by many who speak from personal experience to be well worthy
of any inconvenience or sacrifice involved.

=List of Foods and Fruits. etc., that can be eaten uncooked.=

  _Cheeses_--Camembert, Cheddar, Cheshire, Cream, Dutch, Gorgonzola,
      Gruyere, Gloucester, Half-cheese, Pommel, Port Salut, Stilton,
      St. Ivel, Wenslet, Wensleydale, Wiltshire, etc.

  _Fruits_--(Dried) Apples, apricots, currants, dates, figs,
      muscatels, peaches, prunes or French plums, pears, raisins,
      sultanas, etc.

  (Fresh) Apples, bananas, blackberries, currants, cantaloupes,
      cherries, damsons, gooseberries, greengages, green figs, lemons,
      melons, mulberries, nectarines, orange, pineapple, pears,
      peaches, plums, pomegranates, quince, raspberries, strawberries,
      tangerines, etc.

  _Nuts_--(Fresh) Almonds, Barcelona, Brazil, cobs, coconuts,
      filberts, Spanish, walnuts, etc.

  (Shelled) Almonds, Barcelona, cashew, hazel, pea-nut, pine kernels,
      walnuts, etc.

  _Roots_--Artichokes, carrots, parsnips, turnips and potatoes (which
      must be very finely grated).

  _Vegetables_--Cabbage (red and white), cauliflower, corn salad,
      cucumber, celery, chicory, endive, lettuce, leeks, mustard and
      cress, onion, parsley, radishes, sprouts, spinach, salsify,
      seakale, tomatoes, watercress, etc.


=RECIPES.=

  _Nut-meat_--2-ozs. shelled nuts, 1-oz. bread, 1 tablespoonful of
      milk. Put nuts and bread through a nut-mill. Mix together with
      milk. Roll out thin and cut into shapes with glass. This is
      sufficient for two. Look well over nuts before using, do not
      blanch almonds but rub them well with a cloth.

  _Unfired Pudding or Cakes_--1-oz. each of dates, sultanas, currants,
      candied peel and French plums, and 2-ozs. nuts. Put all through
      a nut-mill and mix well together. Roll out and make into cakes.
      For a pudding, put mixture in a well greased basin, press down,
      leave for an hour or so and turn out. If too moist add
      breadcrumbs. Serve with cream.

  _Unfired Dried Fruit Salad_--Ingredients as for pudding, but do not
      put through a mill; chop all the fruit and nuts and serve dry
      with cream.

  _Dried Fruits_, such as French plums, peaches or apricots should be
      put in soak for 12 hours. Do not cook.


SALADS.

  _Brussels Sprouts_--Use hearts only, which cut into small pieces.

  _Cabbage_--Use hearts only, which cut into small pieces.

  _Cauliflower_--Use flower part only, which cut into small pieces.

  _Chicory or Seakale_--Cut into small pieces.

  _Lettuce_--In the usual way.

  _Spinach and Mint_--Use leaves only, which cut up very small.

  _Root Salad_--Carrots or beetroot and turnips. Peel and put through
      a nut-mill and mix well together.

  Most green salads are improved with the addition of radishes.

  Salads can be mixed ad lib., but a greater variety of food is
      secured by using one or two vegetables only at a time.

  _Salad Dressing_--(1) Half a cup of oil, 1 tablespoonful of lemon
      juice and the yolk of an egg. Mix egg with oil and add lemon
      afterwards. (2) Half a cup of oil and one well mashed tomato
      mixed well together.

  _Flavourings_--For Nut-meat--Use grated lemon peel, mint, thyme or
      grated onion. For Dried Fruit Pudding or Cake--Use ground
      cinnamon, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, ground or preserved ginger.


=QUANTITIES.=

    First meal at 11 o'clock--Per Person--approximately--

    2-ozs. cheese.
    2-ozs. dried Fruit.
    3-ozs. salad or root salad.
    2-ozs. brown bread, biscuits or unfired bread with butter.

    Second meal at 7 o'clock--

    2-ozs. nut-meat.
    6-ozs. raw fruit.
    3-ozs. salad.
    2-ozs. brown bread, biscuits or unfired bread and butter.

    It is well to drink only between meals, i.e., first thing in the
    morning after dressing; between first and second meal; and before
    going to bed. No alcohol or strong tea and coffee should be taken.

=USEFUL DOMESTIC INFORMATION.=


[Illustration]

A clove of garlic will give a very delicate and tasty flavour to many
soups and other dishes. For soups it is only necessary to rub the
tureen with the cut clove before the soup is poured in. For savoury
dishes and stews one small clove may be boiled (after being peeled) in
the stewpan for five minutes.


To remove the skins from tomatoes place them in boiling water for
about two minutes.


Turnips taste much better if a little cream is added to them after
being mashed.


Any cold green vegetable can be used to make a souffle. It should be
rubbed through a sieve, and then 1 or 2 well-beaten eggs should be
added. A few drops of Tarragon vinegar may be used to change the
flavour. (See Recipe 97).


Cheese should be crumbly, as it is then more easily digestible. It is
a good plan to test it in the following manner:--First buy a small
piece and melt a portion with milk in a double saucepan; if it has a
granulated appearance it is safe to buy some more of the same cheese;
if, on the contrary, it is tough and stringy, it should be avoided, as
it will be found lacking in nutriment and will be very liable to cause
digestive troubles.


Butter should be made to look dainty and appetising by being prepared
for the table with butter pats. Small pieces can be twisted round to
form the shape of a hollow shell. It may also be rolled into marbles
and be garnished with parsley.


Parsley can be made a brilliant green by placing it in a cloth (after
chopping), dipping it in cold water, and wringing it tightly in the
hands, squeezing it with the fingers. For garnishing savoury puddings
or fried potatoes, etc., this is worth knowing.

Parsley which has been used for garnishing, or which is in danger of
going to seed, can be preserved green for seasoning purposes by
placing it in the oven on a sheet of paper, and drying it slowly in
such a manner that it does not burn; it should then be rubbed through
a sieve and put into a bottle.


All boiled puddings should be allowed room to swell, or they may prove
heavy when served.


Instead of chopping onions, a coarse nutmeg grater should be kept for
the purpose, and the onion should be grated like lemon rind. This
saves much time and labour and answers better for flavouring soups,
gravies, or savouries of any kind.

The addition of some bicarbonate of soda to the water in which onions
are boiled will neutralize the strong flavour of the oil contained in
them, and prevent it from becoming troublesome to those with whom it
disagrees.


Freshly cut vegetables are more digestible and wholesome than those
which have been lying about in crates or shop windows. They also cook
more quickly. The water in which vegetables have been boiled should be
saved for stock for soups and gravies (except in the case of
potatoes).


To prevent hard-boiled eggs from becoming discoloured, they should be
plunged into cold water as soon as they are removed from the saucepan.


Those of my readers who wish to use unfermented and saltless breads
and cakes can obtain the same from the Wallace P. R. Bakery. The
purity of goods supplied from this factory can be depended upon.


When it is difficult to obtain pineapples for making fruit salads, the
same enhanced flavour can be secured by adding some of Dole's Hawaiian
Pineapple Juice.


To prevent the odour of boiled cabbage pervading the house, place a
piece of bread in the saucepan.


Flaked nuts, if sprinkled over puddings, custards, trifles or jellies,
greatly improve the flavour and appearance.


In the preparation of soups, stews, &c., the preliminary frying of the
vegetables improves the flavour and dispenses with any insipidity. The
oil should be fried until it is brown.




=HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES.=


=Artichokes= should be boiled until tender only. If over-boiled they
become dark coloured and flavourless.

=Asparagus= should be cut into equal lengths and tied into bundles.
These should be stood on end in a deep stewpan, leaving the tops about
an inch above the water. When the stalks are tender the tops will be
cooked also. This plan prevents the tops falling off through being
over-cooked.

=Cabbage= should only be boiled until tender; if over-cooked it is
pulpy and flavourless. Boiling too fast causes the unpleasant odour to
be given off which is sometimes noticeable in a house when this
vegetable is being cooked. The lid of the saucepan should not be used.

=Cauliflower= must not be boiled until its crispness is lost. It must
be only just tender enough to eat. It can be served 'au gratin' (120),
or as in recipe No. 121.

=Carrots= should be steamed, not boiled. The skins should then be
wiped off and they should be served with a white or brown gravy. They
are also nice if scraped, sliced and stewed in haricot broth (recipe
239). The smaller the carrots the more delicate will the flavour be.

=Kidney or Haricot Beans= need to be carefully trimmed so that all
stringy parts are cut away. They should be boiled until tender, and no
longer, and served with thin white sauce. The smaller and greener
they are the better.

Old pods should remain unpicked until nearly ripe, when the solid
beans can be used for haricot soup or entrees. The 'Czar' bean is the
best to grow; it is the giant white haricot, and the seeds are
delicious when picked fresh and cooked at once. There is the same
difference between fresh and dried haricots, as between green and
dried peas. Dried Haricots must be soaked in cold water for twelve
hours before being cooked. They can then be stewed until tender--the
water being saved for soup or stock.

=Vegetable Marrow= should be steamed or boiled in its jacket. The
flavour is lost if this is removed before cooking.

=Mushrooms= should be fried very slowly in a small quantity of butter.
They should be stirred during the process, and the heat employed must
be very moderate indeed or they will be made tough. They can also be
stewed, and served in the gravy when thickened with arrowroot.

=Potatoes= should be cooked in their jackets. To boil them in the best
way, the water in the saucepan should be thrown away when they have
been boiled for 5 minutes and cold water should be substituted. This
plan equalises the cooking of the interior and exterior of the
potatoes. When cooked they should be drained, a clean cloth should be
placed over the pan and they should stand on the hot plate to dry.
They should be lifted out separately, and should be unbroken and
floury. Sodden potatoes ought to be regarded as evidence of
incompetency on the part of the cook.

Potatoes baked in their jackets are considered by many to be
preferable, and, as it is almost impossible to spoil them if this plan
is adopted, it should be employed when the cook is inexperienced.

Fried potatoes, cooked in the Devonshire fashion, are nice for
breakfast. It is best to remove some from the stewpan when half cooked
on the previous day. These should be cut up in a frying pan in which a
fair amount of butter has been melted, and the knife should be used
while they cook. In a few minutes the potatoes should be well packed
together, so that the under-side will brown; an inverted plate should
then be pressed on them and the pan should be turned upside down while
the plate is held in position with one hand. A neat and
savoury-looking dish will thus be made, but over-cooking must be
avoided previous to the browning process, or they will look sloppy.

Potatoes can be mashed with a little milk and butter. They should then
be packed into a pretty shape and garnished with chopped parsley
(109).

Another way of cooking them is to use the frying basket and dip them
in very hot Nutter. They should either be cut into thin fingers
previously, or else be half boiled and broken into pieces. This
latter plan is perhaps best of all, and they are then termed "potatoes
saute," and are sprinkled with chopped parsley before being served.

A very savoury dish can be made by boiling some potatoes until nearly
tender, and then putting them in a pie dish with small pieces of
butter sprinkled over them; they should then be baked until nicely
browned.

To make potatoes _white_ when cooked they should be steeped in cold
water for two hours after peeling.

=Peas= should be placed in a covered jar with a little butter, and
should be steamed until tender. No water is required in the jar. The
pods, if clean and fresh, should be washed, slowly steamed, rubbed
through a colander, and added to any soup or other suitable dish in
preparation. Another method is to boil the peas with mint, salt, sugar
and a pinch of bicarbonate of soda added to the water. Small young
peas should always be chosen in preference to those which are old and
large.

=Spinach= should be cooked according to the directions given in
recipes 90 to 92, or 103.

=Beetroot= should be baked in the oven instead of being boiled. By
this method the flavour is improved and the juices retained.




=LABOUR-SAVING APPLIANCES.=


Domestic work in the kitchen may be very much simplified and lightened
if proper utensils are employed, and those who are able to do so
should obtain the following appliances, in addition to those which are
generally used:--

=The 'Dana' Nut-Mill.= This is used for making bread crumbs from
crusts or stale bread; for flaking nuts and almonds, etc., so as to
make them more easy of digestion, and nut-butter so as to make it mix
more conveniently with dough when employed for making pastry and
cheese--rendering it more readily digestible. This nut-mill may be
obtained from G. Savage & Sons, 33, Aldersgate Street, London, E. C.,
and from Health Food Depots (price 7/6). It serves the same purpose as
a sausage machine as well.

=A Frying-Basket= is necessary for letting down rissoles, croquettes,
cutlets, fritters, potato chips, etc., into the stewpan which is kept
for frying purposes. The stewpan should be four or five inches deep,
so as to avoid the possibility of the Nutter or vegetable fat bubbling
over and catching fire upon the stove. Aluminium or nickel are the
best metals.

=A Raisin Stoner.= It enables one to stone a large quantity of fruit
in a very short time. Most ironmongers stock these machines.

=A Potato Masher.= Necessary for flaking potatoes and preparing
haricot beans, peas, etc., for admixture in rissoles or croquettes. By
this means the skins can be easily removed after they are cooked.

=A Wire Sieve= (about 1/8th-inch mesh). Useful for preparing spinach,
and in many other ways which will suggest themselves to every cook.

=A Duplex Boiler.= For scalding milk by means of a steam jacket. It
prevents burning, and boiling over. The =Gourmet Boiler= is a valuable
cooking appliance of the same sort. Failing these a double saucepan is
necessary.

=A Chopping Basin=--a wooden bowl with a circular chopper which fits
it. This prevents the pieces from jumping off and lessens the time
occupied. It is also less noisy and can be used while the operator is
seated.

=A Vegetable Slicer.= The best appliance for this purpose is a
combination tool--made so that one can slice carrots, etc., to any
size and thickness, and also core apples, peel potatoes and perform
other functions with it.

=A Metal Frying Pan.= A nickel, aluminium, or steel frying pan is
almost a necessity. Enamel chips off very soon and is dangerous, as it
may cause appendicitis.




=MEDICINAL AND DIETETIC QUALITIES.=


As it is important that those who adopt a reformed diet should know
something about the dietetic and medicinal value of the articles they
consume, the following information may prove helpful:--

[Illustration]

=Apples= purify the blood, feed the brain with phosphorus, and help to
eliminate urates and earthy salts from the system. As they contain a
small amount of starch, and a good proportion of grape sugar combined
with certain valuable acids, they constitute a most desirable and
hygienic food for all seasons. They should be ripe and sweet when
eaten. People who cannot digest apples in the ordinary way should
scrape them, and thus eat them in _pulp_ rather than in _pieces_.

=Bananas= also contain phosphorus, and are consequently suitable for
mental workers. They are easily digestible, and nutritious, being
almost a food in themselves.

=French Plums= are judicious food for persons of nervous temperament
and for those whose habits are sedentary; they prevent constipation,
and are nutritious. They should be well stewed, and eaten with cream,
Plasmon snow-cream, or Coconut cream (see recipe 224).

=Strawberries= contain phosphorus and iron, and are therefore
especially desirable for mental workers and anaemic invalids.

=Tomatoes= are good for those who suffer from sluggish liver. The
popular fallacy that they are liable to cause cancer, which was
circulated by thoughtless persons some few years since, has been
pronounced, by the highest medical authorities, to be unsupported by
any evidence whatever, and to be most improbable and absurd. In the
Island of Mauritius this fruit is eaten at almost every meal, and
Bishop Royston stated that during his episcopate of eighteen years he
only heard of one case of the disease.

=Lettuce= is soothing to the system and purifying to the blood. It
should be well dressed with pure olive oil and wine vinegar (2
spoonfuls of oil to 1 of vinegar, well mixed together, with a pinch of
sugar). A lettuce salad eaten with bread and cheese makes a nutritious
and ample meal. The thin and tender-leaved variety (grown under glass
if possible) should always be chosen.

=Figs= contain much fruit sugar which can be rapidly assimilated, and
are very nourishing and easily digestible; when they can be obtained
in their green state they are specially desirable. They may be
considered one of the most valuable of all fruits, and are most
helpful in many cases of sickness on account of their laxative
medicinal properties.

=Dates= are very similar to figs, and are both sustaining and warming;
they are easily digested if the skins are thin.

=Gooseberries=, =Raspberries=, =Currants= and =Grapes= are cooling and
purifying food for hot weather; but, if unripe, they will often upset
the liver. This type of fruit should not be eaten unless _ripe_ and
_sweet_.

=Walnuts, Hazel and Brazil Nuts= contain a considerable amount of oil,
and are consequently useful for warming the body and feeding and
strengthening the nerves. Vegetable fat in this form is emulsified and
more easily assimilated than free animal fats, as in butter, etc. Nuts
are also rich in proteid matter. Where people find that they cannot
masticate nuts, owing to impairment of teeth, the difficulty may be
removed by passing the nuts through a 'Dana' nut-mill. When thus
flaked and spread between thin slices of bread and butter, with honey,
they make delicious sandwiches for lunch. A pinch of curry powder
(instead of the honey) makes them taste savoury.

=Chestnuts= contain a larger proportion of starch, but are digested
without difficulty when boiled in their jackets until fairly soft. If
eaten with a pinch of salt they make a nice dish.

=Pineapples= are valuable for cases of diphtheria and sore-throat, as
the juice makes an excellent gargle. This fruit is considered to aid
digestion in certain cases.

=Cheese= is very rich in protein--far more so than lean beef. If well
chosen, and new, it is a most valuable article of diet, and feeds
brain, nerves, and muscles; but as it is a concentrated food it should
not be taken in excessive quantity. Half a pound of cheese is almost
equal to a pound of average flesh meat. The best varieties are
Wenslet, Gruyere (very rich in phosphorus), Port Salut, Milk (155),
Wensleydale, Cheshire and Cheddar.

=Protose, Nuttose=, and similar malted nut-meats, are more than
equivalent to lean beef--minus water, waste products, and disease
germs. The International Health Association first invented these
valuable substitutes for animal food, and has an able advisory medical
staff, therefore they may be regarded as results of modern dietetic
research. Protose contains 25% protein and 14% fat.

=White Haricots= are rich in protein (far more so than lean meat), and
should be eaten in moderation. Brown haricots contain iron in addition
to their large percentage of protein.

=Lentils= are almost identical in composition, but are more suitable
for those who do not have much physical toil.

=Peas= are slightly less nitrogenous than lentils and haricots, but
otherwise very similar; they are best when eaten in a green form, and
when young and tender. When they are old the peas should always be
passed through a potato masher, as the skins are very indigestible.

=Macaroni= contains starch and a certain amount of the gluten of
wheat. Some of the best varieties are made with eggs as well as flour.
Tomato sauce is the best accompaniment to it, with Parmesan or grated
and melted cheese (see recipes 66 to 71).

=Rice= as usually sold consists chiefly of starch, but if unglazed and
_once milled_, it is much more nourishing, as the cuticle of the
cereal (which is rich in gluten and protein) is then left on it. The
addition of cheese or eggs, makes it a more complete food (see recipes
72 to 80).

=Potatoes= consist principally of starch and water, with a certain
amount of potash. Their dietetic value is not high.

=Wholewheat Bread= contains, in addition to its starch, much vegetable
albumen, and a large supply of mineral salts, such as phosphates, etc.
It is, therefore, when light and well cooked, of high dietetic value
both for flesh-forming and nerve feeding. Physical workers should use
it as a staple article of food, and mental workers will also find it
most helpful. The coarser the brown flour, the more laxative is the
influence of the bread. This is point worth noting.

=Eggs= are nutritive chiefly on account of the albumen which they
contain in the white portion, but they are liable to cause digestive
trouble, and they must not be taken too freely by those who are
subject to biliousness and constipation. Such persons often find it
advantageous to have them boiled quite hard.

=Emprote= (Eustace Miles proteid Food) contains the proteids of wheat
and milk (35%), with digestible Carbohydrates (45.2%), fat (6.6%), and
assimilable salts (7.9%). It makes a good addition to soups,
beverages, and dishes lacking in protein.

=Nuto-Cream Meat= is a modern substitute for white meat and poultry,
containing 19.7% protein, 48% fat, and 23% Carbohydrates. It is made
from nuts and corn, and is useful for invalids and young children.

=Milk= contains nearly all the elements necessary for repairing bodily
waste. It should be scalded for half-an-hour in a double saucepan--to
destroy tubercular and other germs. If then allowed to stand for 12
hours, clotted cream can be skimmed off (as in Devonshire) and the
milk can be used next day. It keeps much longer after being thus
scalded. Dried milk is now procurable in such forms as 'Lacvitum' and
'Plasmon.'

=Celery= is a useful blood purifier, and is valuable in all cases of
rheumatism, gout, &c. Celery salt is a valuable addition to soups and
savoury dishes, and is preferable to common salt.

=Spinach= contains a considerable quantity of iron in a readily
assimilable form, and is, therefore, good for anaemic persons.

=Onions= have a wonderfully improving effect upon the skin and
complexion if eaten raw, and they act powerfully as diuretics.




=HYGIENIC INFORMATION.=


[Sidenote: =How to Keep Young.=]

Old age is accompanied by the accumulation in the body of certain
earthy salts which tend to produce ossification. The deposit of these
in the walls of the arteries impedes the circulation, and produces
senility and decrepitude. Flesh-food accelerates this process, but the
juices of fruits, and distilled or soft water, dissolve out these
deposits. The older one becomes the more freely should one partake of
fruit and soft water.

The more juicy fruit we consume, the less drink of any kind we
require, and the water contained in fruit is of Nature's purest and
best production.

Frequent bathing and the occasional use of the vapour bath also help
to eliminate these deposits, and those whose skins are never made to
perspire by wholesome exercise in the open air must cause this
healthful operation to take place by other means--or pay the penalty
which Nature exacts.

[Sidenote: =Food and Climate.=]

Vegetable oils and fats produce heat and build up the nerves. We
require a much larger amount of food containing fat in cold weather
and in cold climates than in warm weather and in warm climates. By
producing fruits in profusion in the summer-time Nature provides for
the satisfaction of our instinctive desire for such simple and cooling
diet when the temperature is high. But in winter-time more cheese,
butter, olive oil, or nuts, should be eaten every day.

[Sidenote: =Cancer and Flesh-eating.=]

The latest declarations of some of the principal British medical
authorities on 'Cancer' are to the effect that people become afflicted
with this disease through the excessive consumption of animal flesh.
The alimentary canal becomes obstructed with decomposing matter, toxic
elements are generated and absorbed in the system, and cancerous
cellular proliferation ensues. It is noteworthy that fruitarians are
scarcely ever afflicted with this disease, and that a strict
fruitarian dietary (uncooked) has often proved curative. See pages 133
and 166.

[Sidenote: =How to avoid Dyspepsia.=]

If the digestive process is unduly delayed by overloading the stomach,
or by drinking much at meal-times so as to dilute the gastric juice,
fermentation, flatulence and impaired health are likely to result. Raw
sugar if taken very freely with starch foods is also apt to produce
fermentation.

It is a mistake to mix acid fruits and vegetables by eating them
together at the same meal. Fermentation is often thus caused, as
vegetables take a long time to digest. A very safe rule to observe,
and one which would save many from physical discomfort and suffering,
is this--only eat fruits which are palatable in the natural uncooked
state. Before Man invented the art of cooking, he must have followed
this rule.

Those who suffer from dyspepsia will, in most instances, derive
benefit by taking two meals a day instead of three--or at any rate by
substituting a cup of coffee or of hot skimmed milk and a few brown
biscuits for the third meal. Hard workers are the only persons who can
really get hungry three times a day, and we ought not to take our
meals without "hunger sauce." Fruit alone, for the third meal is
better still.

The last meal of the day should not be taken after seven o'clock at
night. Disturbed rest and the habit of dreaming are an almost certain
indication of errors in diet having been committed, or of this rule
having been infringed.

Probably the most valuable prescription ever given to a patient was
that given by Dr. Abernethy to a wealthy dyspeptic, "Live on sixpence
a day and earn it."

Constipation can nearly always be cured by adding stewed figs, French
plums, salads, etc., to one's menu, by eating brown instead of white
bread, and by taking less proteid food.

Tea is detrimental to many persons. The tannin contained in it
toughens albuminous food, and is liable to injure the sensitive lining
of the stomach. China tea is the least harmful.

[Sidenote: =Rest after Meals.=]

Those who work their brains or bodies actively, immediately after a
solid meal, simply invite dyspepsia. The vital force required for
digestion is diverted and malnutrition follows. The deluded
business-man who "cannot spare the time" for a short rest or stroll
after lunch, often damages his constitution and finds that he has
been "penny wise and pound foolish."

If the brain or body has been severely taxed, an interval of rest
should be secured before food is taken. It is not _what we eat_ that
nourishes us, but _what we are able to assimilate_. Recreation,
occasional amusement, and an interest in life are necessary. Thousands
of women die from monotony and continuous domestic care; multitudes of
men succumb to mental strain and incessant business anxiety. Chronic
dyspeptics should reflect on these facts.

Abstainers from animal-food who get into any difficulty about their
diet should seek advice from those who have experience, or should
consult a fruitarian physician. The local names and addresses of
doctors who both practice and advise this simple and natural system of
living, will be supplied upon application to the Hon. Secretary of The
Order of the Golden Age. Such are increasing in number every month.

[Sidenote: =Physical Vitality.=]

The human body is a storage battery consisting of millions of cells in
which the vital electricity that produces health, and makes life
enjoyable, is accumulated.

Every manifestation of physical and mental power depends upon the
force stored up in this battery. The more fully charged the cells the
higher the voltage, and, consequently, the greater the physical
vitality and power. This voltage is always fluctuating. Expenditure
of force lessens it; recuperation, through rest, sleep, the
in-breathing of oxygen, and the assimilation of vital uncooked food
increases it.

Fruits, nuts, and root vegetables contain electrical potency--they
will deflect the needle of a highly sensitive Kelvin galvanometer. But
when cooked, their vital electricity is destroyed--they become
_lifeless_, like flesh-food.

The accumulation of vital force is a possibility if natural and vital
food is selected.

[Sidenote: =The Great Healer.=]

All the medicines in the world are as the small dust of the balance,
potentially, when weighed against this Life-force--which "healeth all
our diseases and redeemeth our life from destruction." Its therapeutic
phenomena are truly wonderful.

When our bodies are invaded by malevolent microbes, the defensive
corpuscles within us, if in fit condition, destroy them. But if not
fed with those elements which are needful for their sustenance, they
soon "run down"--just as we ourselves get "below par." We are then
liable to become the prey of those ceaseless microscopic enemies that
are ever ready to pounce upon the unfit.

If our corpuscles are weaker than the invading foes, no drugs can save
us--we are doomed. Hence the importance of keeping ourselves and our
nerve centres well charged and in vigorous condition.

[Sidenote: =How to Accumulate Vitality.=]

To accumulate vitality our food must contain all the chemical elements
which we need. None must be permanently omitted. If, for instance, we
entirely exclude organic phosphorus from the food of a man of great
intellect, he will, in due time, be reduced to imbecility. This is
obtained in such foods as cheese, milk, wholemeal bread, peas, apples,
strawberries, and bananas.

We must live by _method_, and take some trouble. Nature's greatest
gift is not to be obtained without thought or effort. We must eat,
breathe, and live wisely; and the closer to Nature we get, the better
it will be for us.

The habit of deep breathing, like that of living much in the open air,
yields important results. The atmosphere consists of oxygen and
nitrogen--the very elements of which our bodies are chiefly
constructed. Life and vigour _can be inhaled_, but few persons have
learnt the art.

Cheerfulness tends to promote the assimilation of food. Exercise--of
an intelligent and healthful sort--is needful to make the life-current
pulsate through our tissues. Without it our organs do not get properly
nourished and rebuilt: stiffness and atrophy set in. Worry and care
must be banished, and unwise or excessive expenditure of nerve force
avoided; for these things deplete the human storage battery of its
vitality.

Mankind is slowly gaining greater knowledge of vital, mental, and
spiritual truth. Ultimately, "Life more abundant" will become the
heritage of the many instead of the few.

Self-emancipation from weakness and disability is an achievement that
will repay much effort on the part of each one of us; and we can all
render beneficent social service by exemplifying the art of living
wisely.

By promoting hygienic and humane education, we can prevent much
suffering, and greatly increase the sum of happiness in this world!

    =THE CANCER SCOURGE=
    =and How to Destroy it.=

    By ROBERT BELL, M.D., F.R.F.P.S.

    _Price_ ONE SHILLING _Net (post free 1/2)._

The latest pronouncement by this eminent Cancer Specialist on the most
terrible disease of our times.

       *       *       *       *       *

This book is written by a Physician who has witnessed many cures of
advanced cases of Cancer, and who speaks from the standpoint of forty
years' experience.

It contains 20 Art Plates, illustrating diagnoses from the Blood when
highly magnified, and proves by these object lessons the curability of
Cancer and the efficacy of treatment by Fruitarian Diet and Radium.


A FEW PRESS OPINIONS.

    "It is ... interesting and suggestive ... and it deserves a wide
    circulation."--_Manchester Courier._

    "Every year, in England and Wales, 30,000 people die of
    Cancer--all of which deaths are preventible. Dr. Bell's methods of
    preventing them are clearly and forcibly given, once again, in
    this little book."--_Daily Mirror._

    "The wide prevalence of this terrible disease demands that
    attention should be given to all endeavours to destroy it, and Dr.
    Bell is an authority whose words should be carefully studied and
    acted upon."--_Northern Whig._

    "This interesting little treatise is an able presentation of the
    natural method of dealing with Cancer."--_Two Worlds._

    "Dr. Bell is strongly of opinion that the Scourge is amenable to
    cure, and his remedy is the use of Radium in conjunction with a
    special kind of Fruitarian Diet. When one considers that every
    known remedy of the past has failed and that this suggested cure
    has no revolting methods, such as the knife of the surgeon, it
    should certainly receive the attention it merits."--_American
    Register._

    "The book should be worth reading to those interested in the
    subject."--_Irish News._

    "He (Dr. Bell) deems 'dietetic purification essential,' and
    explains his system, and it must be acknowledged that he is backed
    by very strong evidence, which he gives. His little volume is
    worthy of the closest consideration by all
    concerned."--_Letchworth Citizen._

lies very largely in right diet. Our foods are made from the purest
and finest materials under the most hygienic conditions. They
include:--

    =NUT BUTTERS.= Most delicious. Food as well as fat. Much safer and
    go farther than dairy butter. Almond, =1/3=; Walnut, Coconut and
    Cashew, =1/=; Peanut, =9=d. per lb. The Almond Butter is specially

=THE GOLDEN MEAN.=

White flour is a clogging constipating food that paves the way to
appendicitis, etc. Coarse wholemeal irritates the digestive tract and
wastes the nourishment that should remain in the body.

[Illustration: ="ARTOX" STONE GROUND=]

    ="ARTOX" Pure Wholemeal
    is the Golden Mean.=

It contains every atom of the wheat, but so finely ground that it will
not irritate the most delicate digestion. Its regular use acts like
magic in keeping the internal organs clear and clean.

YOU CAN MAKE EVERYTHING with it, even sponge cakes, AND IT MAKES
EVERYTHING NICER.

Acknowledged to be the most valuable family food of its kind. Granose

so rendered highly digestible. While it is given to very young infants
with great success it is an all-round family food and is increasing in
popularity everywhere. Free Samples supplied to _bona fide_ inquirers.

=PROTOSE.=

A delicious substitute for meat guaranteed to be free from all
chemical impurities. Thoroughly cooked, highly nutritious and
digestible. Made entirely from choice nuts and wheat.

=AVENOLA.=

Makes superior porridge in one minute: also good as a basis for
vegetarian "roasts." Children are delighted with it for breakfast.
Very nourishing.

=NUTTOLENE.=

Without doubt the most delicate and tempting substitute for meat
pastes. Makes excellent sandwiches and is capable of a variety of
uses.

=HEALTH COFFEE.=

place of tea and ordinary coffee.

=The Rise of the Wholemeal Biscuit=

and especially of "Ixion" Biscuits into popular favour is a good sign
of the times. There is a great demand for wholemeal bread and
so-called standard bread just now, but

=GOOD BISCUITS ARE BETTER THAN THE BEST BREAD.=

The wise Food-Reformer prefers wholemeal biscuits to bread because
they not only give much-needed work to the teeth but induce the flow
of saliva and so assist the digestive organs most materially.

="IXION BISCUITS"= are made from the finest wheat most finely ground
by our own stone mills. =They are altogether free from yeast and all
chemical adulterants= and preservatives (including salt).

They are ideal food for growing children, as they contain everything
needed for good blood, bone, muscle, and nerve. The following may be
obtained at all Health Food Stores, or will be sent direct at prices
quoted.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
