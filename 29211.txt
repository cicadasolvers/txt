+At yearend 2001 over 5.6 million U.S. adults had ever served time in
State or Federal prison+

*  Of adults in 2001 who had ever served time in prison, nearly as many
were black (2,166,000) as were white (2,203,000). An estimated 997,000
were Hispanic.

*  The rate of ever having gone to prison among adult black
males(16.6%) was over twice as high as among adult Hispanic males
(7.7%) and over 6 times as high as among adult white males (2.6%).

*  U.S. residents ages 35 to 39 in 2001 were more likely to have gone
to prison (3.8%) than any other age group, up from 2.3% in 1991.

*  An estimated 22% of black males ages 35 to 44 in 2001 had ever been
confined in State or Federal prison, compared to 10.0% of Hispanic
males and 3.5% of white males in the same age group.

*  About 1 in 3 black males, 1 in 6 Hispanic males, and 1 in 17 white
males are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current
incarceration rates remain unchanged.

*  For women, the chances of going to prison were 6 times greater in
2001 (1.8%) than in 1974 (0.3%); for men, the chances of going to
prison were over 3 times greater in 2001 (11.3%) than in 1974 (3.6%).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

At yearend 2001 there were 1,319,000 adults confined in State or
Federal prison and an estimated 4,299,000 living former prisoners. A
total of 5,618,000 U.S. adult residents, or about 1 in every 37 U.S.
adults, had ever served time in prison. Estimates of the prevalence of
imprisonment in the U.S. population, presented here for the first time,
are based on a demographic model incorporating rates of mortality and
first incarceration in prison.

Between 1974 and 2001, the prevalence of imprisonment increased by
nearly 3.8 million. This included a 1.1 million increase in the number
of adults in prison (up from 216,000) and a nearly 2.7 million increase
in the number of living former prisoners (up from 1,603,000).

If rates of first incarceration remain unchanged, 6.6% of all persons
born in the United States in 2001 will go to State or Federal prison
during their lifetime, up from 5.2% in 1991, and 1.9% in 1974. Unlike
the prevalence of ever having gone to prison, which estimates the
extent of past experiences, the lifetime likelihood of going to prison
is an estimate of the chances of future incarceration, given unchanged
rates of first incarceration and mortality.

+4.3 million U.S. residents in 2001 were former prisoners+

Of the estimated 5.6 million adults in the United States who had been
incarcerated in State or Federal prison at some time before yearend
2001, nearly 4.3 million were no longer in prison (table 1). Former
prisoners accounted for 77% of all adult residents who had ever been
confined in prison.

+Demographic techniques used to create prevalence estimates+

Estimates of the prevalence of ever having gone to prison were derived
from generation life table techniques. The prevalence of ever having
gone to prison includes adults currently in prison and living former
prisoners.

One-day counts of the number of adults in prison are available through
the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS). Collected annually
since 1926, the NPS provides a count at yearend of persons held in
Federal and State prisons.

To obtain the number of persons who had ever gone to prison, separate
generation life tables were prepared for persons alive between 1974 and
2001. These tables model the first incarceration and mortality
experience of each birth cohort as it proceeded through life. Estimates
were made of the number of persons going to prison for the first time,
by year of age, and the number who had been incarcerated and survived
to each later age.

Rates of first incarceration during a 12-month period were developed
from prison inmate surveys conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, 1991, and
1997, a period during which admission rates increased after many years
of relative stability.

Prevalence estimates for selected calendar years represent a sum of the
contribution of each birth cohort to the total number of adults alive
who had ever gone to prison. The number of former prisoners was
obtained by subtracting the number of prisoners at yearend (NPS) from
the total.

Estimates exclude admissions to local jails, due to the absence of data
needed to calculate first admissions to jail. (See Methodology for
estimation procedures and limitations.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

+1 in 37 adult U.S. residents in 2001 had ever served time in prison+

The 5.6 million adult U.S. residents who were current and former
prisoners, represented an increase of 3.8 million since 1974. At
yearend 2001, 2,673 persons per 100,000 adult U.S. residents had ever
gone to prison, up from 1,251 per 100,000 adult residents in 1974.
Overall, approximately 1 in 37 adult residents in 2001 had ever served
time in a State or Federal prison.

As a percent of all adults who had ever gone to a State or Federal
prison, the number of former prisoners has steadily declined (from 88%
in 1974 to 77% in 2001). The decline occurred as the number of adults
confined in prison at yearend grew by 1.1 million -- a 6-fold increase.
Over the 27-year period the number of adult prison inmates rose from
216,000 to 1,319,000. By yearend 2001, there were 628 prison inmates
per 100,000 adult residents, up from 149 in 1974.

Between 1974 and 2001 the number of former prisoners living in the
United States more than doubled, from 1,603,000 to 4,299,000. Relative
to the adult population, the number of former prisoners totaled 2,045
per 100,000 adult U.S. residents in 2001, up from 1,102 per 100,000 in
1974. At yearend 2001, 1 in every 49 adults in the United States was a
former prisoner.

+Two-thirds of the increase in number ever incarcerated due to rise in
first incarceration rates+

Nearly two-thirds of the 3.8 million increase in the number of adults
ever incarcerated in prison between 1974 and 2001 occurred as a result
of an increase in the rates of first incarceration. In 1974 the number
of persons admitted to prison for the first time totaled 44 per 100,000
adult residents.  By 2001 the rate had nearly tripled, reaching 129
first admissions per 100,000 adults.

Over 40% of the total increase in first incarceration rates occurred
between 1986 and 1991. First incarceration rates increased from 73 per
100,000 in 1986 to 111 in 1991.

About a third of the 3.8 million increase in the number ever
incarcerated occurred as a result of growth in the U.S. resident
population. Based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number
of residents 18 and older increased from 145 million in 1974 to 210
million in 2001. Had the rates of first incarceration remained stable
at 1974 levels, the number of adults who had ever gone to prison would
have increased by an estimated 1.3 million.

In every year, the rates of first incarceration varied by age (figure
1). In 2001 sharply higher first incarceration rates were found for
each older birth cohort up to a peak of 350 per 100,000 at age 20.
These rates then dropped steadily with each older age category.

  Note: 3-year averages were used to smooth age-specific rates.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------


Between 1974 and 2001 the rate of first incarceration rose in nearly
every age-specific category. The largest increases occurred among
younger age cohorts -- those that already had high first incarceration
rates. The peak incarceration rate increased by over 200 persons per
100,000 (from 143 at age 21 in 1974, to 350 at age 20 in 2001). Rates
increased even among persons age 45 or older.

+In 2001, 3 out of 10 adults ever incarcerated were age 35 to 44+

Persons between ages 35 and 44 accounted for the largest number of
current and former prisoners at yearend 2001 (table 2). Born between
1957 and 1966, these persons turned 18 in the late 1970s and early
1980s when first incarceration rates began to climb.  Between 1974 and
2001, the number ever incarcerated in this age group rose from 324,000
to 1.67 million.

Among persons between ages 25 and 34, the number ever incarcerated
nearly quadrupled (from 343,000 in 1974 to 1.29 million in 2001). While
persons in this age group also experienced rising first incarceration
rates, they were subject to these rates for a smaller portion of their
lifespan than those ages 35 to 44.

As a percent of those ever incarcerated, persons ages 35 to 44
increased from 18% in 1974 to 30% by 2001; persons age 25 to 34
increased from 19% in 1974 to 23% in 2001.

+Prevalence rates up sharply among persons under age 50+

Between 1974 and 2001, the rise in first incarceration rates had the
largest effects on younger age groups. The percent of persons ever
incarcerated tripled among persons ages 25 to 29 (from 1.0% in 1974 to
3.1% in 2001)and more than doubled among persons ages 30 to 34 (from
1.3% to 3.7%) and persons ages 35 to 39 (from 1.4% to 3.8%) (table 3).

In contrast, the rise in the percents ever incarcerated was more modest
among persons 50 or older. Although these age groups also experienced
rising first incarceration rates, they were exposed at older ages when
first incarceration rates are low. Persons age 65 and older were the
least affected by the increases in first incarceration rates, with
percents ever incarcerated rising from 1.5% in 1974 to 1.7% in 2001.

These changes in the percents ever incarcerated by age reflect rising
rates of first incarceration and the age of each of these birth cohorts
when the increases occurred.  In the future, the percents ever
incarcerated will rise among older age groups as more recent cohorts
experience the full impact of current levels of first incarceration
rates throughout their lifetimes (figure 2).

+More males than females and more blacks and Hispanics than whites had
ever served time in prison+

Nearly 9 times as many men (5,037,000) as women (581,000) had ever been
incarcerated in a State or Federal prison at yearend 2001. As a
percentage of all persons ever confined in prison, women increased from
7.8% in 1974 to 10.3% in 2001.

At yearend 2001 nearly as many blacks (2,166,000) as whites (2,203,000)
had ever served time in prison; Hispanics numbered about half of either
group (997,000). Together, blacks (39%) and Hispanics (18%) constituted
a majority of those who had ever served time in prison in 2001. Whites
accounted for 39% of all those ever incarcerated in 2001, down from 51%
in 1974.

Over the 27-year period, the share of those who are black and Hispanic
among persons ever incarcerated increased. The number of Hispanics rose
nearly 10-fold (up from 102,000 in 1974) and the number of  blacks more
than tripled (up from 646,000), while the number of whites more than
doubled (up from 922,000). As a result, blacks rose from 36% to 39% of
all persons ever incarcerated, while Hispanics rose from 6% to 18%.

+Nearly 17% of adult black males had ever served time in prison+

In 2001 an estimated 16.6% of adult black males were current or former
State or Federal prisoners -- a rate that was twice that of Hispanic
males (7.7%), and 6 times that of white males (2.6%) (table 5).

Female rates, though significantly lower, reveal similar racial and
ethnic disparities. Adult black females were nearly 2 1/2 times more
likely than adult Hispanic females and 5 1/2 times more likely than
adult white females to have ever served time in State or Federal prison.

Among adult residents in 2001, an estimated 1.7% of black females, 0.7%
of Hispanic females and 0.3% of white females had ever been
incarcerated in a prison.

Among both men and women who had ever been confined in prison in 2001,
blacks outnumbered whites in each age category under age 45; whites
outnumbered blacks in nearly every age category 45 or older (table 6).
The percentage of blacks declined steadily among each older age group
(dropping from 44% among those ages 18 to 24 to 29% among persons 65 or
older). The percentage of Hispanics also declined among older age
groups (dropping from 24% among those ages 18 to 24 to 8% among those
age 65 or older). In contrast, at yearend 2001 the percentage white
among all adults ever incarcerated increased from 27% of those ages 18
to 24 to 52% among persons age 65 or older.

There was a similar pattern among women, though the percents were lower
than for men. An estimated 0.9% of women ages 35 to 44 had ever been in
prison, compared to 0.2% for women ages 18 to 24 and age 65 or older.

When rates were estimated separately by race and Hispanic origin, the
variations among age groups remained unchanged. In every gender and
racial/ethnic group in 2001, the percent of ever having been
incarcerated was lowest among the youngest group (those ages 18 to
24)and the oldest age group (age 65 or older).

Among persons ages 35 to 44, more than 22.0% of black males had ever
been incarcerated in prison, over twice as high as Hispanic males
(10.0%), and over 6 times higher than white males (3.5%). In this same
age group, black women (2.8%) were over twice as likely as Hispanic
women (1.1%), and nearly 6 times as likely as white women (0.5%) to
have been in prison.

+Impact of rising first incarceration rate varies by birth cohort+

Persons born prior to 1940 were nearly unaffected by the rising first
incarceration rates of the 1980's and 1990's. At younger ages (up to
the age of 40), the prevalence rates at 5-year age intervals were the
same for persons born in 1935 as in 1910 (table 8). The rising rates of
first incarceration increased the prevalence of incarceration among
those born in 1935 as they reached age 45. Similarly, the prevalence
rates rose for those born in 1930 as they reached age 50.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Among persons born after 1935, the effects of rising first
incarceration rates occurred at increasingly younger ages. Persons born
in 1955 were the first to record higher prevalence rates at all ages,
compared to persons born in prior years. At age 45 the percent ever
having been in prison reached 3.2% for persons born in 1955 -- more
than double the percent at that age among persons born in 1930 or
earlier.

The greatest rise occurred in the percents having been incarcerated
among the most recent cohorts. For persons born in 1975, 2.6% had been
to prison by age 25, nearly equal to the percent among persons born in
1950 who had been to prison by age 50 (2.7%).

Projections for years after 2001 indicate the percent ever incarcerated
will rise at an accelerated pace. If rates of first incarceration
remain at 2001 levels, 5.4% of persons born in 1965 are expected to
have gone to prison by age 75, more than three times the 1.7% of
persons born in 1930.

The projected rise in the percent ever incarcerated slows among persons
in later cohorts.  Of those born in 1970, 6.0% are expected to have
been in prison by age 75, compared to 6.5% of those born in 1975, and
6.6% of those born in 1980.

+3.4% of adults projected to have served time in prison by 2010+

The prevalence of having been to prison will rise among the U.S. adult
population as more birth cohorts experience the full impact of current
levels of first incarceration. Assuming that current age-specific rates
of first incarceration remain at 2001 levels, the number of adults
having ever served time in prison is projected to rise to 7.7 million
by 2010.  A total of 3.4% of the adult population (1 in 29 persons age
18 or older) is expected to have served time in prison.

+Lifetime likelihood estimates of going to prison differ from current
prevalence estimates+

The lifetime likelihood of going to prison is an estimate of the
percentage of all persons in a birth cohort expected to go to prison
over the course of a lifetime. In contrast, the prevalence of ever
having gone to prison is an estimate of the percentage who have ever
gone to prison among just the surviving members of all birth cohorts
over a specific period.

Estimates of the lifetime likelihood of going to prison project the
percentage of persons at birth expected to go to prison, if the entire
cohort were subject to a fixed set of rates of first admission to
prison and mortality over an entire lifetime. In calculating these
estimates, incarceration and mortality rates are fixed at the time of
"birth" of the cohort.

Standard life table techniques were used to prepare estimates of the
lifetime likelihood of going to prison based on rates of first
incarceration during a 12-month period derived from inmate surveys
conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, 1991, and 1997. (See Lifetime Likelihood
of Going to State or Federal Prison, NCJ 160092, March 1997, for a
description of previous estimates.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

+6.6% of persons born in 2001 will go to prison, if current rates of
first incarceration remain unchanged+

If rates of first incarceration and mortality in 2001 remain unchanged,
nearly 1 in 15 persons born in 2001 (6.6%) will go to State or Federal
prison during their lifetime (figure 3).

Unlike the yearend 2001 prevalence rate of 2.7%, which represents the
cumulative result of the past incarceration experiences of the living
adult population, the lifetime likelihood is a hypothetical projection
of the future if a birth cohort were to experience a fixed set of rates
of first incarceration and mortality over a lifetime.

Between 1974 and 2001, the lifetime chances of going to State or
Federal prison for U.S. residents overall in- creased from 1.9% to
6.6%. Each estimate summarized the effects of first incarceration and
mortality during a 12-month period in 1974, 1986, 1991, and 2001. The
estimates do not take into account changes in rates of first
incarceration or mortality that occur after the "birth" of the
hypothetical cohort. As a result of steadily rising rates of first
incarceration from 1974 to 2001, the lifetime chances of going to
prison for persons born in 1974 will be higher than 1.9%. Based on
rates of first incarceration through 2001, an estimated 2.6% of persons
born in 1975 had already been incarcerated by age 25.

+6 times higher lifetime chance of going to prison in 2001 for men than
for women+

Based on rates of first incarceration in 2001, the lifetime chances for
men of going to prison are 6 times greater than those for women (table
9). A male has a 11.3% (or 1 in 9) chance in his life-time of going to
prison, while a female has a 1.8% (or 1 in 56) chance. An estimated
9.6% of men and 1.5% of women are expected to go to prison by age 40,
as first incarceration rates riserapidly, then decline with advancing
age (figures 4 and 5).

In 2001, the chances of going to prison were highest among black males
(32.2%)and Hispanic males (17.2%) and lowest among white males (5.9%).
The lifetime chances of going to prison among black females (5.6%) were
nearly as high as for white males. Hispanic females (2.2%) and white
females (0.9%) had much lower chances of going to prison.

As a result of changes in first incarceration and mortality rates
between 1974 and 2001, black males experienced a greater increase in
the chances of going to prison over the course of a lifetime than any
other group (from 13.4% in 1974 to 32.2% in 2001). Hispanic males
experienced the second largest increase (from 4.0% in 1974 to 17.2% in
2001). White males experienced a smaller increase (from 2.2% in 1974 to
5.9% in 2001).

The lifetime chances of going to prison increased more rapidly for
black females (from 1.1% in 1974 to 5.6% in 2001) than for white males.
Hispanic females (from 0.4% in 1974 to 2.2% in 2001) and white females
(from 0.2% in 1974 to 0.9% in 2001) had smaller increases in their
lifetime chances of going to prison.

At every age men have higher chances of going to prison than women, and
blacks and Hispanics have higher chances than whites. Based on current
rates of first incarceration, an estimated 6.7% of black males will
enter State or Federal prison by the time they are age 20, compared to
3.0% of Hispanic males and 0.8% of white males.

+Methodology+

_Life table techniques_

Life table techniques previously used to illustrate the implications of
prevailing incarceration rates in 1991 have been extended to model the
incarceration experience of actual generations of U.S. residents. (See
Lifetime Likelihood of Going to State or Federal Prison, NCJ 160092,
March 1997.) These generation life tables provide the data needed to
estimate the number of living persons who have ever been incarcerated.

A generation life table traces a birth cohort of 100,000 persons
through their entire lives, subjecting them to the observed
age-specific mortality and incarceration rates which they encountered
in each subsequent calendar year of life. The procedure is known as a
double-decrement life table because there are two forms of exit from
the initial 100,000 birth cohort. The procedure yields estimates of the
number of persons in the birth cohort who are incarcerated for the
first time each year or who die.

At each year of age, the estimated number of living persons ever
incarcerated is equal to the number of persons identified as a prisoner
for the first time that year plus the number of surviving members of
the birth cohort who were prisoners in prior years. The age-specific
prevalence rate for members of the birth cohort is obtained by dividing
the surviving number of persons ever incarcerated by the number of
members of the 100,000 birth cohort who have survived to the current
age (including both those never incarcerated and those ever
incarcerated).

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

To model the incarceration experience of the adult resident population
in 2001, a separate generation life table was needed for each birth
cohort born from 1901 to 1983. For example, of those born in 1980 and
alive in 2001, an estimated 1.510% had ever gone to prison (Appendix
table 1, column 2). Multiplying by 4,140,721 U.S. residents age 21 in
2001 (column 1), produced an estimate of 63,000 persons, age 21 in
2001, who had ever been incarcerated (column 3).

Similarly, the generation life table for the 1970 birth cohort produced
an estimated prevalence of 3.584% among those age 31 in 2001.
Multiplying by 4,032,301 U.S. residents age 31 in 2001 resulted in an
estimated 145,000 persons age 31 in 2001 who had ever been
incarcerated. The estimated 5,618,000 adults ever incarcerated in 2001
was obtained by summing the number of persons ever incarcerated, age 18
or older. Dividing by the adult resident population of 210,207,901
yielded an estimated prevalence of ever having gone to prison of 2.673%
in 2001.

+Estimating prevalence of imprisonment in the United States+

To illustrate the application of generation life table techniques
resulting in the 1.510% rate of ever having gone to prison among
persons born in 1980, consider the following calculations:

1. Estimates of the number of persons in a population of 100,000 born
in 1980 who died during each age interval were obtained by multiplying
the age-specific mortality rate (Appendix table 2, column 2) by the
number of persons alive and not previously incarcerated at each age
(column 1).

*  For example, among persons who reached age 21 without having been
previously incarcerated, a total of 92 were estimated to have died
(column 3) before reaching age 22 (that is, 96,607 times the mortality
rate of 0.000955).

2. The number of persons in the 1980 cohort who were at risk to
incarceration during an age interval was then calculated by subtracting
the number dying from the number of persons who were alive and not
previously incarcerated at the beginning of the age interval (column 1
minus column 3).

*  An estimated 96,515 of the persons who survived to age 21 without
being incarcerated were at risk to first incarceration at age 21.

3. The number of persons in the original 100,000 population estimated
to have been admitted to prison at each age (column 5) was then
obtained by multiplying the age-specific first admission rates (column
4)by the number of persons alive and not previously incarcerated.

*  Among persons born in 1980 who had not been previously incarcerated
by age 21, 343 were estimated to have been incarcerated before they
reached age 22 (that is, 96,515 times the first incarceration rate of
.003557).

4.  The number of living persons at each age who had ever gone to
prison was then calculated by summing the number going to prison for
the first time during that year of age (column 5) plus the number of
members of the 1980 birth cohort who previously went to prison and
survived until the next year of age (column 6 times the survival rate,
not shown).

*  Of the 1,132 persons who had gone to prison and reached age 20,
1,131 survived to reach age 21. An additional 343 persons were expected
to be incarcerated for the first time before reaching age 22 (for a
cumulative total of 1,474).

5. The percent of persons at each specific age who had ever gone to
prison (column 7) was then calculated by dividing the number of persons
who had ever gone to prison and were still alive (column 6) by all
persons who were still alive (including persons never incarcerated plus
ever incarcerated).

*  Among persons age 21, the prevalence rate was 1.510%, obtained by
dividing 1,474 (column 6) by 97,646 (column 1 minus columns 3 and 5,
plus 1,474), times 100%.

Prevalence rates for other birth cohorts were calculated using similar
procedures.  For example, to estimate the percent of persons age 31 in
2001 who had ever gone to prison, the calculations were applied to the
1970 birth cohort.  However, the rates of first incarceration (column
4) and mortality (column 2) used in the calculations were unique to the
birth cohort. (Note the differences between Appendix tables 2 and 3.)

  age-specific mortality rates(column 2) were multiplied by the number
  of persons alive and not previously incarcerated (column 1).

  [b] To estimate the number expected to go to prison at each year of
  age, age-specific first admission rates (column 4) were multiplied
  by the number of persons surviving (column 1 minus column 3).

  [c] To estimate the surviving number of first admissions, the number
  of first admissions from the x-th year of age (column 5) were added
  to the number of surviving first admissions from the x-1 year of age.
  Mortality rates for ex-prisoners by age were based on mortality rates
  in the general population and adjusted to reflect higher ex-prisoner
  mortality.

  [d]To estimate the prevalence percent, this procedure was followed.

  The surviving number of persons ever incarcerated (column 6) was
  divided by the total number of surviving persons never incarcerated
  (column 1 minus both columns 3 and 5) and persons ever incarcerated
  (column 6), times 100%.

  [a] To estimate the number expected to die at each year of age,
  age-specific mortality rates(column 2) were multiplied by the number
  of persons alive and not previously incarcerated (column 1).

  [b] To estimate the number expected to go to prison at each year of
  age, age-specific first admission rates (column 4) were multiplied
  by the number of persons surviving (column 1 minus column 3).

  [c] To estimate the surviving number of first admissions, the number
  of first admissions from the x-th year of age (column 5) were added
  to the number of surviving first admissions from the x-1 year of age.
  Mortality rates for ex-prisoners by age were based on mortality rates
  in the general population and adjusted to reflect higher ex-prisoner
  mortality.

  [d] To estimate the prevalence percent, this procedure was followed.
  The surviving number of persons ever incarcerated (column 6) was
  divided by the total number of surviving persons never incarcerated
  (column 1 minus both columns 3 and 5) and persons ever incarcerated
  (column 6), times 100%.

_Limitations_

1. The data in this report are restricted to incarcerations in State or
Federal prison. Excluded are prior incarcerations in local jails and
juvenile facilities because of the lack of data needed to estimate the
number of first admissions to these forms of correctional supervision.

2. Estimates of the number of first admissions are subject to sampling
and nonsampling errors. Because the numbers of first admissions are
based on a sample rather than a complete enumeration, the estimated
number of first admissions may vary depending on the size of the
estimate and the base population for each demographic group.

Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources, such as
nonresponse, differences in interpretation of questions, recall
difficulties, and processing errors. Among inmates, the number of first
admissions may be slightly overestimated because of underreporting of
criminal histories. The full extent of nonsampling error is unknown.

3. No comparable inmate survey was conducted prior 1974 to enable the
calculation of first incarceration rates prior to this date. First
incarceration rates in 1970 and earlier were estimated to be 80% of
each age-specific rate of first incarceration in 1974.

If first incarceration rates in 1970 and earlier had averaged 90% of
each age-specific first incarceration rate in 1974, the estimated
number of adults alive in 2001 who had ever gone to prison would have
been 1.9% higher (5,723,000). Alternatively, if earlier first
incarceration rates had averaged 70% of 1974 rates, the estimated
number of persons ever to have been incarcerated in 2001 would have
been-1.9% lower (5,513,000).

4. Mortality rate schedules for prisoners were not available. Compared
with the general population, mortality rates for prisoners were
estimated to be 20% higher for adults under age 65, and the same for
those age 65 and older. The estimate was based on the lower overall
educational attainment of prisoners, and longitudinal studies
documenting the relationship between mortality and educational
attainment.

If mortality rates for adults ever incarcerated, under age 65 were
instead 40% higher than that of the general population, the estimated
prevalence of ever having gone to prison in 2001 would be 5,567,000
(-0.9% less). If mortality rates for prisoners had been equal to that
of the general population, the estimated prevalence would have been
0.9% higher in 2001 (5,670,000).

5. Comparable mortality rates prior to 1976 were not available.
However, there is minimal effect of declining mortality rates since
1900 on the estimated number of persons ever incarcerated. Prevalence
rates are only affected to the extent that there may have been a
different decline in mortality among those ever incarcerated (the
numerator) compared with all surviving members of a birth cohort (the
denominator). Furthermore, prevalence rates were applied to estimates
of the U.S. resident population (which fully reflect declines in
mortality).

6. Age-specific incarceration rates do not incorporate a forecast of
future rates of imprisonment, which may be affected by changes in
criminal behavior, law enforcement, and in sentencing policies.
Consequently, the lifetime likelihood of incarceration, 2001, and
projected prevalence rates for 2002 and beyond may be different.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
