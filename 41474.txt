Introduction


This volume of brief selections from a wide range of Southern expression
in prose and verse leads into fields of American history and literature
which, perhaps, are not well known to the general public. The reader is
not offered stacks of straw to thresh over; on the contrary, it has been
the aim of the compiler, in a most congenial and delightful task, to
afford others easy access to grain that he has already garnered. Generally
speaking, the genius of literary production in the Old South did not
aspire to an outlet in the field of professional endeavor. There were,
however, many gifted writers who regarded production in prose and verse as
a pleasant recreation rather than an end, or as an accomplishment common
to cultured minds, to be called forth as occasion offered, or when some
emotion prompted expression.

By way of illustration, William Henry Timrod may be regarded as
potentially a greater poet than his better-known son. Yet he was one of
the occasional poets of the old regime. John Laurens composed a sonnet as
he lay dying of wounds and fever incurred in defence of his country; and
Stuart, in a later struggle, wrote verses while engaged in riding around
McClellan's army. These and many others like them never seriously
considered revising or publishing their work. They sang from time to time
because to them "singing itself is so sweet." This peculiar diffidence is
a relic of the past; and at the present time, one need but review the list
of leading American novelists to find that a remarkably large proportion
have come from the South and write on Southern themes.

Thus, while the very nature of the South lends itself to sentiment and
romance, her history is yet to be written. This little volume attempts,
therefore, with particular care, to treat of historical events as their
anniversaries bring them to mind. Comparatively few are the enduring works
of Southern historians; and yet from the beginning of colonization the
South has thrilled with the record of daring achievement. In the work of
her soldiers and statesmen, the South led in shaping the Republic out of
rebellion, revolution, and jarring elements. During and after the struggle
with the mother country, Jefferson, Henry, Clark, and Virginia gave to the
Nation the great States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin. It was Jefferson who secured to the Republic peaceful
possession of the vast original tract of Louisiana; and it was he, with
Lewis and Clark, who made good the claim to the Oregon territory.
Furthermore, the mighty empire of Texas and the far Southwest was brought
in under the initiative of the South and the leadership of Polk and Tyler.

So did the South mightily assist in making a common government great and
strong; but she was likewise building up a power which later overwhelmed
her. In truth, she forged the fetters that for forty years chafed her
people under an increasingly oppressive legislation; since it was a son of
Carolina who first brought forward a tariff for protection, not for
Carolina, but for New England and the Nation; and it was Clay of Kentucky
who fostered the system until it involved the thirteen agricultural States
of the South in an indirect taxation more burdensome than any direct
impost ever proposed by Great Britain for the thirteen Colonies. In vain
the South protested. Opposing majorities grew against her. And when a
solidly sectional party became the dominant power, the Lower South
attempted to exercise the hitherto generally conceded right of
withdrawal, a right which had been particularly emphasized in New England
when that section felt its interests to be in peril. The Upper South
opposed coercion; and both prepared for the fight that followed. Such is
the principle for which the South contended. She failed not in valor or in
honor, but fell through exhaustion; yet glory stood beside her grief, and
she endowed the Nation with the stainless names of Lee and Jackson.

With the failure of the South to establish her independence, there fell
also, as an incident of the struggle, that which most made her a separate
section, politically, economically, and socially--the tutelage, in the
most beneficent form of servitude ever known, of a child-race. That race
was largely thrust upon her; and yet she raised its people from cannibal
savages to civilized beings, whose devotion and faithfulness became the
marvel of invading armies. Rather than interpret such a record to her
shame, as some would have us do, let it be proclaimed as an everlasting
tribute to the lofty character of Anglo-Saxon Christianity.

The South, after fifty years, is more intimately a part of the Union than
ever before. Her interests are national and her destiny great. In the
youthful Bagley she was the first to give her blood in the war with
Spain, therewith cementing the tie that now, without fetters, binds in a
steadily growing amity and understanding. To-day, a true Southerner has an
abiding love and loyalty for the section that has seen tears and grief, as
well as sunshine and flowers, beyond the measure of any country of modern
times; but he is also doubly true to, and proud of, the mighty progress of
a reunited Republic. Surely it is due to the South and due to the Nation
that the story of the South be told. And the highest aim of the compiler
of these selections is that he may contribute something to promote that
steadily expanding knowledge of historical truth which alone can fully
allay the spirit of sectional strife, and from which alone we may look for
perfect amity and understanding to ensue.

TO TIME, THE OLD TRAVELER

  They slander thee, Old Traveler,
    Who say that thy delight
  Is to scatter ruin, far and wide,
    In thy wantonness of might:
  For not a leaf that falleth
    Before thy restless wings,
  But in thy flight, thou changest it
    To a thousand brighter things.

         *       *       *       *

  'Tis true thy progress layeth
    Full many a loved one low,
  And for the brave and beautiful
    Thou hast caused our tears to flow;
  But always near the couch of death
    Nor thou, nor we can stay;
  _And the breath of thy departing wings
    Dries all our tears away_!

  Some thunder on the heights of song, their race
  Godlike in power, while others at their feet
  Are breathing measures scarce less strong and sweet
  Than those that peal from out that loftiest place;
  Meantime, just midway on the mount, his face
  Fairer than April heavens, when storms retreat,
  And on their edges rain and sunshine meet,
  Pipes the soft lyrist lays of tender grace,
  But where the slopes of bright Parnassus sweep
  Near to the common ground, a various throng
  Chant lowlier measures--yet each tuneful strain
  (The silvery minor of earth's perfect song)
  Blends with that music of the topmost steep,
  O'er whose vast realm the master minstrels reign!

in America for a hundred and fifty years after the settlement of

The strange and curious race madness of the American Republic will be a
study for centuries to come. That madness took a child-race out of a warm
cradle, threw it into the ocean of politics--the stormiest and most
treacherous we have known--and bade it swim for its own and the life of
the nation!

Few have equaled the old time negro at repartee, and a true Southerner
heartily relished a clever rejoinder to his good natured raillery. The
rejoinder was frequently overwhelming, always respectful, and generally
worth an immediate acknowledgment in cash or old clothes.

"Is that you, Peter?" called an old Confederate to his former body-servant
on the road.

Peter grinned broadly as he doffed his hat. "Yas, suh, dis yer me."

"Well, well!" laughed the other. "I see that all the old fools are not
dead yet."

"Dat's so, Mars' Tom." Peter pulled his grizzly forelock appreciatively.
"I's monsus glad to see dat you's in such good health, suh."

A WELL-KNOWN TYPE OF SOUTHERN MATRON BEFORE THE WAR

Full well she knew the seriousness of life. Over and over the cares and
responsibilities of her station as the mother of so many children, the
mistress of so many servants and the hostess of so many guests, had
utterly overwhelmed her. * * * * * Into how many negro cabins had she not
gone, when the night was far spent and the lamp of life flickered low in
the breast of the dying slave! How often she ministered to him with her
own hands! * * * * Nay, had she not knelt by his lowly bed and poured out
her heart to God as his soul winged its flight, and closed his glazed and
staring eyes as the day was dawning? Yet the morning meal found her at her
accustomed seat, tranquil and helpful, and no one but her husband the
wiser for her night's ministrations.

Jackson's line, extending about half a mile from the river to the swamp,
was defended by a water-filled ditch and by a parapet of varying height
and thickness. The idea that it was built of cotton bales is an absurd
fiction that brings back the inspiring picture in Peter Parley's old
history of our childhood days....

  Consider the lark! How he rises on wing,
    And mounts to the sky through ethereal air!
  He sings as he soars; 'tis his nature to sing,
    To warble his notes though no listener be near.
  I seek not for fortune, I sigh not for fame,
    I follow my Muse into forest or street;
  In sorrow, in gladness, I sing all the same,
    I sing because singing itself is so sweet.

    [These lines, typifying so much of the poetical expression of the old
    South, were written by former Surgeon H. M. Clarkson, C. S. A., who,
    on January 9, 1861, as a corporal of artillery, fired a single shot
    from Fort Moultrie to challenge the _Star of the West_ in its attempt
    to reinforce Fort Sumter. On the same occasion two other shots were
    fired by the State cadets stationed on Morris Island, driving the
    transport from the harbor. It is not improbable, therefore, that, as
    the challenger of the hostile steamer, the writer of these verses
    fired the first shot of the war between the States. Corporal Clarkson
    was in charge of gun No. 13.--EDITOR]

SECESSION: A SOUTHERN VIEW, 1861

A State, finding herself in the condition in which Mississippi has judged
she is--in which her safety requires that she should provide for the
maintenance of her rights out of the Union--surrenders all the benefits
(and they are known to be many), deprives herself of the advantages (and
they are known to be great), severs all the ties of affection (and they
are close and enduring), which have bound her to the Union; and thus
divesting herself of every benefit--taking upon herself every burden--she
claims to be exempt from any power to execute the laws of the United
States within her limits.

Whenever it shall appear that these causes are radical and permanent, a

constraint, among nominal friends, but real enemies, inflamed by mutual
hatred and jealousy, and inviting, by intestine divisions, contempt and
aggression from abroad.--_Journal of the Hartford Convention_

The States of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee were engaged in practical
movements for the gradual emancipation of their slaves. This movement
continued until it was arrested by the aggressions of the Abolitionists.

And if the secrets of all hearts could have been revealed, our enemies
would have been astounded to see how many thousands and tens of thousands
in the Southern States felt the crushing burden and the awful
responsibility of the institution which we were supposed to be defending
with the melodramatic fury of pirate kings. We were born to this social
order, we had to do our duty in it according to our lights, and this duty
was made indefinitely more difficult by the interference of those who, as
we thought, could not understand the conditions of the problem, and who
did not have to bear the expense of the experiments they proposed.

A Northerner, who had purchased an estate in Virginia, noticed that smoke
always emanated from the chimney of a cabin near his woods where an old
negro lived. One day, on meeting the old colored man, he asked: "Where do
you get your wood, Uncle?"

The latter eyed him with an expression of great reproach and replied: "My
pa was coachman at the Gret House, and he pa, and he pa; 'whar I git my
wood?' That ain't no question for one gen'l'man to ax an'er!"

VALLEY FORGE EXCEEDED

Starvation, literal starvation, was doing its deadly work. So depleted and
poisoned was the blood of many of Lee's men from insufficient and unsound
food that a slight wound which would probably not have been reported at
the beginning of the war would often cause blood-poison, gangrene, and
death. Yet the spirits of these brave men seemed to rise as their
condition grew more desperate.... It was a harrowing but not uncommon
sight to see those hungry men gather the wasted corn from under the feet
of half-fed horses, and wash and parch and eat it to satisfy in some
measure their craving for food.

While the Confederate soldiers were in the trenches, the ingenuity of the
Southern women was taxed to the utmost to supply their household needs.
Medicine had been declared contraband of war by the Federal Government,
and salt works were made a special object for attack. Remedies were
improvised from herbs of all kinds; the dirt floor of the meat house was
boiled for the salt it contained; soap was made from china-berries and
lye; candles out of resin or waxed rope wound around a corncob; thorns
were used for pins; shoes were fashioned out of canvas, and supplied with
wooden soles; buttons were made from persimmon seed; tumblers out of glass
bottles; tea out of berry leaves; and coffee was made from sweet potatoes
and dandelion seed.

The following lines are remarkable in that they represent a boy's estimate
of Stonewall Jackson before the war between the States. They were written
by William Fitzhugh Lee when a cadet under Jackson at the Virginia
Military Institute:--

  Like some rough brute that roams the forest wild,
  So rude, uncouth, so purely Nature's child,
  Is "Hickory," and yet methinks I see
  The stamp of genius on his brow; and he,
  With his mild glance and keen, but quiet eye,
  Can draw forth from the secret recess where they lie
  Those thoughts and feelings of the human heart
  Most virtuous, good, and free from guilty art.
  There's something in his very mode of life
  So accurate, steady, void of care and strife,
  That fills my heart with love for him who bears
  His honors meekly and who wears
  The laurels of a hero! This is a fact,
  So here's a heart and hand for "Jack!"

Wherein, then, lay his strength, and what was the secret of his influence
over all this land? I answer in one word--character. And what is meant by
character? Courage? Yes; courage of his opinions, and physical courage as
well; for he had a Briton's faith in pluck. Pride of race? In a limited
sense, yes. Honesty? The question is almost an insult. Love of truth? Yes,
undying love of it.

If this bill passes, it is my deliberate opinion that it is virtually a

some, definitely to prepare for a separation, amicably if they can,
violently if they must.

The rights of Louisiana as a sovereign State are those of Virginia; no
more, no less. Let those who deny her right to resume delegated powers
successfully refute the claim of Virginia to the same right, in spite of
her expressed reservation made and notified to her sister States when she
consented to enter the Union.... For two-thirds of a century this right
has been known by many of the States to be, at all times, within their
power.

It was Lee who suggested the capture of Stony Point, and it was a band of

that fortress. Three hundred Virginians followed Lee in his successful
dash against Paulus Hook on the Jersey coast, August, 1779.

The Emperor of France made him Commander of the Legion of Honor; The
Emperor of Russia, Knight of the Order of St. Ann; the King of Denmark,
Knight of the Dannebrog; the King of Portugal, Knight of the Tower and
Sword; the King of Belgium, Knight of the Order of St. Leopold;
simultaneously with Tennyson, he was awarded an LL.D. by the University of
Cambridge, England; he received honorary membership from a score of the
world's leading societies of science and scholarship; the Pope conferred
upon him a noteworthy testimonial; the Emperor of Mexico gave him a
decoration; and Prussia, Austria, Sweden, Holland, Sardinia, Bremen, and
France struck medals in his honor as the greatest scientist of the New
World, and the peer of any in the Old.

The government of his own country, says Professor Francis H. Smith, has
"carefully omitted his name in official records of the departments he
created"; nor is it even given a place among the many inscribed in the

The great change wrought by the States in resuming their sovereignty, and

no rebellion, no suspension of authority, no social disorders, no lawless

Conservatism marked every proceeding and public act. The object was to do
what was necessary and no more; and to do that with the utmost temperance

After the passage of the Anti-Ku Klux Statute by the State of Tennessee,
several instances occurred of parties being arrested in Ku Klux disguises;
but in every case they proved to be either negroes or "radical" Brownlow

party in power to become a dead letter before its repeal. It bore too hard
on the "loyal" men when enforced.

The Ku Klux Klan was a great Law and Order League of mounted night
cavalrymen called into action by the intolerable conditions of a reign of
terror.... It was the old answer of organized manhood to organized crime
masquerading under the forms of government.... Women and children had eyes
and saw not, ears and heard not. Over four hundred thousand disguises for
men and horses were made by the women of the South, and not one secret
ever passed their lips!

The View of a "Reconstructionist"

The Ku Klux Order was a daring conception for a conquered people. Only a
race of warlike instincts and regal pride could have conceived or executed
it. Men, women, and children must have, and be worthy of, implicit mutual
trust. They must be trusted with the secrets of life and death without
reserve and without fear.

likewise to be under your command.... The honor and interest of the State

The importance of this brilliant exploit was destined to be far greater
than even Clark foresaw, for when the treaty of peace was being negotiated
at Paris in 1782, our allies, France and Spain, were both more than
willing to sacrifice our interests in order to keep us out of the
Mississippi Valley, and the western boundary of the United States would
undoubtedly have been fixed at the Alleghanies instead of the Mississippi,
but for the fact that this western region was actually occupied by
Virginians.

IN THE PETERSBURG TRENCHES

Winter poured down its snows and its sleets upon Lee's shelterless men in
the trenches. Some of them burrowed into the earth. Most of them shivered
over the feeble fires, kept burning along the lines. Scanty and thin were
the garments of these heroes. Most of them were clad in mere rags. Gaunt
famine oppressed them every hour. One quarter of a pound of bacon and a
little meal was the daily portion assigned to each man by the rules of the
War Department. But even this allowance failed when the railroads broke
down and left the bacon and the flour piled up beside the tracks in
Georgia and the Carolinas. One sixth of this daily ration was the
allotment for a considerable time, and very often the supply of bacon
failed entirely....

The war began, the war went on--this politicians' conspiracy, this
slaveholders' rebellion, as it was variously called by those who sought
its source, now in the disappointed ambition of the Southern leaders, now
in the desperate determination of a slaveholding oligarchy to perpetuate
their power, and to secure forever their proprietorship in their "human
chattels." On this theory the mass of the Southern people were but puppets
in the hands of political wirepullers, or blind followers of hectoring
"patricians." To those who know the Southern people nothing can be more
absurd; to those who know their personal independence, to those who know
the deep interest which they have always taken in politics, the keen
intelligence with which they have always followed the questions of the
day.

  I would I had a spirit-harp to seize

  When apple-blossoms swing against the sky.
  On every dark or blust'ring wintry day
  That airy harp the bluebird's lilt should play;
  And as I held my sighs and paused to hear,
  The wand'ring message, with its full-fed cheer
  And ripe contentment, to my life should bring
  The essence and fruition of the Spring.

of blacks, chiefly, and a navy of warships going up and down waterways."

later, under the guns of Ft. Monroe, she declined the subsequent battle
challenges of the refitted _Virginia_.

TWO VIEWS OF VIRGINIA

(The latter is taken from a witty parody on the original poem. Presented
to a Virginia girl, it was indignantly tossed into the wastebasket. Later,
however, she copied it and sent it around for the amusement of many--_in
the family_!)

  I.  The days are never quite so long
        As in Virginia;
      Nor quite so filled with happy song
        As in Virginia;
      And when my time has come to die
      Just take me back and let me lie
      Close where the James goes rolling by,
        Down in Virginia.

  II. Nowhere such storms obscure the sun
        As in Virginia;
      Nowhere so slow the railroads run,
        As in Virginia;
      And when my time has come to go
      Just take me there, because, you know,
      I'll longer live, I'll die so slow,
        Down in Virginia.

A HUMOROUS VIEW OF "THE HUB"

For the native Bostonian there are three paths to glory. If his name be
Quincy or Adams, nothing more is expected of him. His blue blood carries
him through life with glory, and straight to heaven when he dies. Failing
in the happy accident of birth, the candidate for Beacon Hill honors must
write a book. This is easy. The man who can breathe Boston air and not
write a book is either a fool or a phenomenon. One course remains to him
should he miss fame in these lines. He must be a reformer.

The great mind of Madison was one of the first to entertain distinctly the
noble conception of two kinds of government, operating at one and the same
time, upon the same individuals, harmonious with each other, but each
supreme in its own sphere. Such is the fundamental conception of our
partly Federal, partly National Government, which appears throughout the
Virginia plan, as well as in the Constitution which grew out of it.

Those who dominated were intelligent, masterful, patriotic, loving home,
kindred, state and country, dispensing a prodigal hospitality, limited
only by the respectability and behavior of guests. Among girls,
refinement, culture, modesty, purity and a becoming behavior were the
characteristic traits; among boys, courtesy, courage, chivalry, respect to
age, devotion to the weaker sex, scorning meanness, regarding dishonor and
cowardice as ineffaceable stains.

Nor had Calvert planted English institutions in Maryland simply as he
found them. He went back to a better time for freedom of action, and
looked forward to a better time for freedom of thought. While as yet there
was no spot in Christendom where religious belief was free, and when even
the Commons of England had openly declared against toleration, he founded
a community wherein no man was to be molested for his faith.

Jamestown and St. Mary's are both within the segment of a circle of
comparatively small radius whose center is at the mouth of the Chesapeake.
In this strategic region, the Jamestown experiment succeeded, after
Raleigh's head had fallen on the block; the Revolution was fired by the
eloquence of Patrick Henry, and was consummated at Yorktown; the War of
1812 was settled by the victories of North Point and McHenry; the crisis
of the Civil War occurred; and seven Presidents of the United States were
born.

A great event of this [Tyler's] administration was the Ashburton Treaty.
This settled our northeast boundary for 200 miles and warded off the long
impending war with England. In most histories the whole credit for this
treaty is given to Daniel Webster. Of course this great man should not be
robbed of any of his well-earned laurels; but the President is entitled to
a share of the honor. Webster himself said: "It proceeded from step to
step under the President's own immediate eye and correction." Moreover, it
may be added that at one stage in the proceedings Lord Ashburton was about
to give up and return to England; but President Tyler by his courtesy and
suavity, conciliated him and induced him to go on with the negotiation.

doubted that any portion of the United States would fight on a proper
occasion.... There are courageous and honest men enough in both sections
to fight. There is no question of courage involved. The people of both
sections of the Union have illustrated their courage on too many
battlefields to be questioned. They have shown their fighting qualities
shoulder to shoulder whenever their country has called upon them; but that
they may never come in contact with each other in a fratricidal war should
be the ardent wish and earnest desire of every true man and honest
patriot."

CALHOUN'S NATIONALISM

At the peace of 1815 the Government was $120,000,000 in debt; its revenues
were small; its credit not great, and the effort to raise money by direct
taxation brought it in conflict with the States.... Mr. Calhoun came
forward and devised a tariff, which not only gave large revenues to the
Government, but gave great protection to manufacturers. Mr. Calhoun
received unmeasured abuse for his pains from the North, where the
interests were then navigation, and Daniel Webster was the great apostle
of free trade.... Under Mr. Calhoun's tariff the New England manufacturers
prospered rapidly.... Success stimulated cupidity, and the "black tariff"
of 1828 marked the growth of abuse.... It was then that Mr. Calhoun again
stepped forth. He stated that the South had cheerfully paid the enormous
burden of duties on imports when Northern manufactures were young and the
Government weak; the manufacturers had become rich, and the Government
strong--so strong that State rights were being merged into its
overshadowing power; he therefore demanded a recognition of State rights,
and an amelioration of those burdens that the South had so long borne.

  The birds that sing in the leafy Spring,

  A wit that brings worship and wisdom too!
    Coo! coo! te weet tu whu--
    The wit to woo--te weet tu whu!

  Heard noon and night in the cedar grove,
    Is very soon taught where the heart is true:
  For the wit to woo, and the wisdom too,

  But echo me well, and you learn to woo--

had not noticed or who had forgotten, as it is forgotten to-day, that this
was not the first firing upon the Stars and Stripes. The flag had been
fired upon from the coast of South Carolina as early as January 9, 1861,
for the same reason as that which provoked attack upon it on April 12.

There was but one exception to the general grief too remarkable to be

The Union League of America was organized in Cleveland, Ohio, during the

League was to form a conspiracy against Lincoln and prevent his
renomination for a second term.

  The dusk of the South is tender
    As the touch of a soft, soft hand;
  It comes between splendor and splendor,
  The sweetest of service to render,
    And gathers the cares of the land.

  Above it the soft sky blushes
    And pales like an April rose;
  Within it the South wind hushes,
  And the Jessamine's heart outgushes,
    And earth like an emerald glows.

Apropos of this last, let me confess, Mr. President--before the praise of
New England has died on my lips--that I believe the best product of her
present life is the procession of 17,000 Vermont Democrats that for
twenty-two years, undiminished by death, unrecruited by birth or
conversion, have marched over their rugged hills, cast their Democratic
ballots, and gone back home to pray for their unregenerate neighbors, and
awoke to read the record of 26,000 Republican majority! May the God of the
helpless and heroic help them!

Homes without the means of support were no longer homes. With barns and

they were dismal abodes of hunger, of hopelessness, and of almost
measureless woe.

Too much roseate nonsense has been indulged about life on the plantation

whose energy built up the State; they lived often rather in rude profusion
than in luxury.

  The dead had rest; the Dove of Peace
    Brooded o'er both with equal wings;
  To both had come that great surcease.
  The last omnipotent release
    From all the world's delirious stings.
  To bugle deaf and signal-gun,
    They slept, like heroes of old Greece,
  Beneath the glebe at Arlington.

  And in the Spring's benignant reign,
    The sweet May woke her harp of pines;
  Teaching her choir a thrilling strain
  Of jubilee to land and main.
    She danced in emerald down the lines;
  Denying largesse bright to none,
    She saw no difference in the signs
  That told who slept at Arlington.

  She gave her grasses and her showers
    To all alike who dreamed in dust;
  Her song-birds wove their dainty bowers
  Amid the jasmine buds and flowers,
    And piped with an impartial trust--
  Waifs of the air and liberal sun,
    Their guileless glees were kind and just
  To friend and foe at Arlington.

It depends on the State itself, to retain or abolish the principle of
representation, because it depends on itself whether it will continue a
member of the Union. To deny this right would be inconsistent with the
principle on which all our political systems are founded, which is, that
the people have, in all cases, a right to determine how they will be
governed.

Throughout the events that led up to the Revolution, it seemed ordained
that Massachusetts was to suffer and Virginia to sympathize. Until the
outbreak of actual hostilities scarcely anything of moment occurred on the
soil of Virginia to incite her sons to champion the cause of freedom.
Indeed, from the beginning of the controversy between the colonies and the
mother country, the British Ministry seemed to have avoided any special
cause of irritation to the people of the Old Dominion. The part,
therefore, which Virginia took in the events of those days must be
attributed to her devotion to the principles of liberty, to her interest
in the common cause of the colonies, and particularly to her sympathy with
Massachusetts in the suffering which that province was called upon to
endure. If we lose sight of these motives as the springs of Virginia's
conduct in that struggle, we shall be unable to appreciate either the
nobility of her spirit or the wisdom and energy which marked her
initiative.

  Upon the quiet mountain top,
  Steals drowsily and musically
  Into the universal valley.
  The rosemary nods upon the grave;
  The lily lolls upon the wave;
  Wrapping the fog above its breast,
  The ruin moulders into rest;
  Looking like Lethe, see! the lake

In regard to African Slavery, which has played so important a part in our
political history, Randolph was an Emancipationist, as distinguished from
an Abolitionist. This distinction was a very broad one; as broad as that
between Algernon Sidney and Jack Cade; or between Charlemagne and Peter
the Hermit--in fact, it was the difference between Reason and Fanaticism.
On this subject Randolph and Clay concurred; both were Emancipationists,
and both denounced the Abolitionists; as did also Webster, and all the
best, wisest, and purest men of that day.

  Aurora faints in the fulgent fire
    Of the Monarch of Morning's bright embrace
  And the summer day climbs higher and higher
    Up the cerulean space;
  The pearl-tints fade from the radiant grain,
    And the sportive breeze of the ocean dies,
  And soon in the noontide's soundless rain
    The fields seem graced by a million eyes;
  Each grain with a glance from its lidded fold
  As bright as a gnome's in his mine of gold,
  While the slumb'rous glamour of beam and heat
  Glides over and under the windless wheat.

    If he were wrong or right?
  He knows ere this whose cause was just
    In God the Father's sight.
  He wields no warlike weapons now,
    Returns no foeman's thrust,--
  Who but a coward would revile
    An honest soldier's dust?

    Adown thy rocky glen,
  Above thee lies the grave of one
    Of Stonewall Jackson's men.

We believed that it was most desirable that the North should win; we
believed in the principle that the Union is indissoluble; but we equally
believed that those who stood against us held just as sacred convictions
that were the opposite of ours, and we respected them, as every man with a
heart must respect those who gave all for their belief.

The band preceding the coffin smote on their ears with poignant loud
lamenting, then carried its sorrow to die moaning on the night. As the
shadowy cortege filed by--men bearing lanterns on either side the
hearse--a horse, riderless, with boots empty in the stirrups, following--a
few soldiers carrying arms reversed--a single carriage with mourners--the
effect was infinitely sad. So common the spectacle during the Battle
Summer, it did not occur to them to even wonder which of our martyrs was
thus journeying to his last home.

  A little bird there was once, with golden wings;
  In the stars she would build her nest;
  And so, with a twig in her beak, at eventide
  When Hesperus sank to rest,
  Away to the starry deep she flew;--for said she,
  "In the Pleiades shall my nesting be!"
  Ah, little bird! There are heights far, far too high
  For the reach of those tiny wings!
  Down here by this thicket of haw let us rest, you and I,

By Captain Winslow's account, the _Kearsarge_ was struck twenty-eight
times; but his ship being armored, my shot and shell fell harmless into
the sea. The _Alabama_ was not mortally wounded until after the
_Kearsarge_ had been firing at her _an hour and ten minutes_. In the
meantime, in spite of the armor of the _Kearsarge_, I lodged a rifled
percussion shell near her stern post--_where there were no chains_--which
failed to explode because of the defect of the cap. On so slight an
incident--the defect of a percussion-cap--did the battle hinge.

Jamestown and St. Mary's are both within the segment of a circle of
comparatively small radius whose centre is at the mouth of the Chesapeake.
In this strategic region, the key of America, Raleigh chose the base from
which he would colonize the new empire; here the Jamestown experiment
succeeded, after Raleigh's head had fallen on the block; the Revolution
was fired by the eloquence of Patrick Henry, and was consummated at
Yorktown; the War of 1812 was settled by the victories of North Point and
Fort McHenry; the crisis of the Civil War occurred; and seven Presidents
of the United States were born.

AN AMUSING COMMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF SOME HISTORIES

I have here a small volume entitled, "John Randolph, by Henry Adams." It
is one of a series called "American Statesmen," and emanates from the thin
air of Boston. The series is edited by Mr. J. T. Morse, Jr. By what law of
selection he has been governed in allotting to particular authors the
preparation of respective biographies it is impossible to divine. It is
quite clear, however, that he has not followed any rule of qualification
or congeniality hitherto recognized by men or angels. For example, a
foreigner, Dr. Von Holtz, who, in an emphatically European and un-American
treatise on the Federal Constitution, had already denounced Calhoun as a
kind of Lucifer, is appointed his biographer; Henry Clay, the father of
Protection (as it is called), is assigned to Carl Schurz, who, I
understand, is an ardent advocate of Free Trade; while John Randolph is
turned over to the tender mercies of a descendant of the first
Vice-President, and the grandson of John Quincy Adams!

Had this unique law of selection prevailed hitherto, we might have had a
biography of Luther by Leo the Tenth; a life of St. Thomas Aquinas by
Thomas Payne; while Pontius Pilate, or more likely the devil himself,
would have been selected to chronicle the divine career of Jesus Christ.

A PROPHECY, 1869

The close of the Civil War found the conquering States so nearly equally
divided between the Radical and Conservative parties, that if the South
should be restored to her relative might in the Union, the balance would
be thrown at once in favor of the Conservatives. The problem therefore
assumed a mathematical form, and demanded that the South should not
reinforce the Conservatives of the North. This could be prevented only in
two ways, _viz._; either by keeping the South out of the Union entirely or
by placing the political power there in the hands of a minority. To adopt
one or the other of these expedients was a party necessity. This is the
whole key to Reconstruction; and fifty years hence no man living will be
found to deny it.

A SOUTHERN SOLDIER'S TRIBUTE

To the Union commander, General George Gordon Meade, history will accord
the honor of having handled his army at Gettysburg with unquestioned
ability. The record and the results of the battle entitle him to a high
place among Union leaders. To him and to his able subordinates and heroic
men is due the credit of having successfully met and repelled the Army of
Northern Virginia in the meridian of its hope and confidence and power.

  GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON

_First day at Gettysburg, 1863_


July Second

General Lee distinctly ordered Longstreet to attack early the morning of
the second day, and if he had done so, two of the largest corps of Meade's
army would not have been in the fight; but Longstreet delayed the attack
until four o'clock in the afternoon, and thus lost his opportunity of
occupying Little Round Top, the key to the position, which he might have
done in the morning without firing a shot or losing a man.

  GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON

_Second day at Gettysburg, 1863_


July Third

General Lee ordered Longstreet to attack at daybreak on the morning of the
third day.... He did not attack until two or three o'clock in the
afternoon, the artillery opening at one.... Nothing that occurred at
Gettysburg, nor anything that has been written since of that battle, has
lessened the conviction that, had Lee's orders been promptly and cordially
executed, Meade's centre on the third day would have been penetrated and
the Union Army overwhelmingly defeated.

General Lee, according to the testimony of Colonel Walter H. Taylor,

order was given, ordered Longstreet to make the attack on the last day,
with the three divisions of his corps, and two divisions of A. P. Hill's
corps, and that instead of doing so he sent fourteen thousand men to
assail Meade's army in his strong position, and heavily intrenched.

FACT OR FICTION?

For four years the Northern States fought to keep their Southern sisters
in the Federal family; then having soundly thrashed these sisters in order
to keep them at home, they suddenly shut the door and kicked them down the
steps! The "erring sisters" are now fully restored to the family circle;
but they had a longer and more painful struggle in the effort to get back
than in the attempt to get away. More briefly, for four years the Federal
government, led by Lincoln, maintained that all of the Southern States
were in the Union and could not get out; and then for five years, under
the rule of the Radicals, it argued that some of these States were out of
the Union and could not get in!

  The muffled drum's sad roll has beat
    The soldier's last tattoo;
  No more on life's parade shall meet

  On Fame's eternal camping-ground
    Their silent tents are spread,
  And Glory guards, with solemn round,
    The bivouac of the dead.

the Pilgrims set foot on American soil, the vine of liberty had so deeply

It was probably the most remarkable evidence on record of the
resourcefulness of the Anglo-Saxon race, and its ability and determination
to dominate. Driven to desperation by conditions that threatened to
destroy their civilization, the citizens of the South, through this
organization, turned upon their enemies, overwhelmed them, and became
again masters of their own soil ... and its proper use must be commended
by all good men everywhere, for by it was preserved the purest Anglo-Saxon
civilization of this nation.

SUMMER

  A trembling haze hangs over all the fields--
    The panting cattle in the river stand
  Seeking the coolness which its wave scarce yields.
    It seems a Sabbath thro' the drowsy land:
  So hush'd is all beneath the Summer's spell,
  I pause and listen for some faint church bell.

  The leaves are motionless--the song-bird's mute--
    The very air seems somnolent and sick:
  The spreading branches with o'er-ripened fruit
    Show in the sunshine all their clusters thick,
  While now and then a mellow apple falls
  With a dull sound within the orchard's walls.

  The sky has but one solitary cloud,
    Like a dark island in a sea of light;
  The parching furrows 'twixt the corn-rows plough'd
    Seem fairly dancing in my dazzled sight,
  While over yonder road a dusty haze
  Grows reddish purple in the sultry blaze.

The Southampton Insurrection, which occurred in August, 1831, was one of
those untoward incidents which so often marked the history of slavery.
Under the leadership of one Nat Turner, a negro preacher of some
education, who felt that he had been called of God to deliver his race
from bondage, the negroes attacked the whites at night, and before the
assault could be suppressed, fifty-seven whites, principally women and
children, had been killed. This deplorable event assumed an even more
portentous aspect when it was realized that the leader was a slave to whom
the privilege of education had been accorded, and that one of his
lieutenants was a free negro. In addition, there existed a wide-spread
belief among the whites that influences and instigations from without the
State were responsible for the insurrection.

But in addition to the Southampton Massacre, and the failure of the
Legislature to enact any effective legislation, the contemporary rise of
the Abolitionists in the North came as an even more powerful factor to
embarrass the efforts of the Virginia emancipators. Unlike the
anti-slavery men of former years, this new school not only attacked the
institution of slavery, but the morality of the slaveholders and their
sympathizers. In their fierce arraignment, not only were the humane and
considerate linked in infamy with the cruel and intolerant, but the whole
population of the slave-holding States, their civilization and their
morals were the object of unrelenting and incessant assaults.

  BEVERLY B. MUNFORD

Resolved, "That secession from the United States Government is the duty of
every Abolitionist, since no one can take office or deposit his vote under

rendering himself an abettor of the slave-holder in his sin."

His last campaign alone, even ending as it did in defeat, would have
sufficed to fix him forever as a star of the first magnitude in the
constellation of great captains. Though he succumbed at last to the
"policy of attrition," pursued by his patient and able antagonist, it was
not until Grant had lost in the campaign over 124,000 men, better armed
and equipped--two men for every one that Lee had had in his army from the
beginning of the campaign.

By the recognized universal public law of all the earth, war dissolves all
political compacts. Our forefathers gave as one of their grounds for
asserting their independence that the King of Great Britain had "abdicated
government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war upon
us." The people and the Government of the Northern States of the late
Union have acted in the same manner toward Missouri, and have dissolved,
by war, the connection heretofore existing between her and them.

effectually that he had to jump from the stern into the river and save
himself by swimming; and with colors flying, the gallant _Arkansas_, whose
decks had never been pressed by the foot of an enemy, was blown into the

I will say that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about

that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of
negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor inter-marry with white
people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical
difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever
forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political
equality. And, inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain
together, there must be the position of superior and inferior; and I, as
much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position
assigned to the white race.

The radicals and negroes had, in the summer of 1867, refused to
"co-operate" with the representative white citizens in restoring political

convention was held in October, 1867. About 94,000 negroes voted. The
radical majority included five foreign born, twenty-five negroes,
twenty-eight Northerners, and fourteen Virginians. Never before in the
history of the State had negroes sat in a law-making body. The former
political leaders were absent. The State had been revolutionized.

Weak and haggard from their diet of green corn and apples, one can well
imagine with what surprise their eyes opened upon the contents of the
sutler's stores, containing an amount and variety of property such as they
had never conceived. Then came a storming charge of men rushing in a
tumultuous mob over each other's heads, under each other's feet, anywhere,
everywhere to satisfy a craving stronger than a yearning for fame. There
were no laggards in that charge.... Men ragged and famished clutched
tenaciously at whatever came in their way, and whether of clothing or
food, of luxury or necessity. A long yellow-haired, bare-footed son of the
South claimed as prizes a tooth-brush, a box of candles, a barrel of
coffee. From piles of new clothing the Southerners arrayed themselves in
the blue uniforms of the Federals. The naked were clad, the barefooted
were shod, and the sick provided with luxuries to which they had long been
strangers.

In the rapidity with which the opportunity was seized, in the combination

inferior to Austerlitz or Salamanca. That the result was less decisive was
due to the greater difficulties of the battle-field, to the stubborn
resistance of the enemy, to the obstacles in the way of rapid and
connected movement, and to the inexperience of the troops.

  My deep wound burns, my pale lips quake in death,
  I feel my fainting heart resign its strife,
  And reaching now the limit of my life.
  Lord, to thy will I yield my parting breath,
  Yet many a dream hath charmed my youthful eye;
  And must life's visions all depart?
  Oh, surely no! for all that fired my heart
  To rapture here shall live with me on high;
  And that fair form that won my earliest vow,
  That my young spirit prized all else above,
  And now adored as Freedom, now as Love,
  Stands in seraphic guise before me now;
  And as my failing senses fade away
  It beckons me on high, to realms of endless day.

AUTUMN SONG

  My Life is but a leaf upon the tree--
    A growth upon the stem that feedeth all.
    A touch of frost--and suddenly I fall,
  To follow where my sister-blossoms be.

  The selfsame sun, the shadow, and the rain
    That brought the budding verdure to the bough,
    Shall strip the fading foliage as now,
  And leave the limb in nakedness again.

  My life is but a leaf upon the tree;
    The winds of birth and death upon it blow;
    But whence it came and whither it shall go,
  Is mystery of mysteries to me.

    And weep--and weeping pray--Thy will be done.

On this point, however, all parties in the South were agreed, and the vast
majority of the people of the North--before the war. The Abolitionist
proper was considered not so much a friend of the negro as the enemy of
society. As the war went on, and the Abolitionist saw the "glory of the
Lord" revealed in a way he had never hoped for, he saw at the same time,
or rather ought to have seen, that the order he had lived to destroy could
not have been a system of hellish wrong and fiendish cruelty; else the
prophetic vision of the liberators would have been fulfilled, and the
horrors of San Domingo would have polluted this fair land. For the negro
race does not deserve undivided praise for its conduct during the war. Let
some small part of the credit be given to the masters, not all to the
finer qualities of their "brothers in black." The school in which the
training was given is closed, and who wishes to open it? Its methods were
old-fashioned and were sadly behind the times, but the old schoolmasters
turned out scholars who, in certain branches of moral philosophy, were not
inferior to the graduates of the new university.

  Here's a toast to the dead already,
    And here's to the next who dies.

If slavery were an unutterably evil institution, with no alleviating
features, how are we to account for the fact that when the Confederate
soldiers were at the front fighting, as they thought, for their
independence, the negroes on the plantations took care of the women and
children and old people, and nothing like an act of violence was ever
known among them?... Is it not perfectly evident that there was a great
rebellion, but that the rebels were the Northerners and that those who
defended the Constitution as it was were the Southerners; but they
defended State rights and slavery, which were distinctly intrenched within
the Constitution?

In regard to Barbara Frietchie a word may be said: An old woman by that
now immortal name did live in Frederick in those days, but she was 84
years of age and bed-ridden. She never saw General Jackson, and he never
saw her. I was with him every minute of the time he was in Frederick, and
nothing like the scene so graphically described by the poet ever happened.

OF JAMES RUMSEY, INVENTOR OF THE FIRST STEAMBOAT

I have seen the model of Mr. Rumsey's boat, constructed to work against
the stream, examined the powers upon which it acts, been the eye witness
to an actual experiment in running water of some rapidity, and give it as
my opinion (although I had little faith before) that he has discovered the
art of working boats by mechanism and small manual assistance against
rapid currents; that the discovery is of vast importance; may be of the
greatest usefulness in our inland navigation, and if it succeeds (of which
I have no doubt) that the value of it is greatly enhanced by the
simplicity of the works; which, when seen and explained, may be executed
by the most common mechanic.

  My life is like the autumn leaf
    That trembles in the moon's pale ray;
  Its hold is frail, its date is brief,

  The parent tree will mourn its shade,
  The winds bewail the leafless tree;
  But none shall breathe a sigh for me!

Long and close association with the white race had its civilizing effect
upon the negroes, and it was not long before the two races became warmly
attached, both alike manifesting a keen interest in the other's welfare.
Thus as economic interests had fixed the system in the laws of the people,
the domestication of the race fixed it in their hearts. The abolitionist
was right in his position on the ethics of slavery, but more than
benighted in his conception of its condition in the South.

In conclusion, the Battle of North Point saved Baltimore from a
pre-determined fate; it encouraged the rest of the country; it, with
Plattsburg, caused the English Ministry to suggest that the Duke of
Wellington should take command in America, and it influenced the terms of
the treaty of Ghent in favor of the United States.

LEE'S ORDER OF INVASION, 1862

That he did not reap the full fruits of this wonderful generalship was due
to one of those strange events which, so insignificant in itself, yet is
fateful to decide the issues of nations....

It will be seen that Lee had no doubt whatever of the success of his
undertaking. Both he and Jackson knew Harper's Ferry and the surrounding
country, and his plan, so simple and yet so complete, was laid out with a
precision as absolute as if formed on the ground instead of on the march
in a new country. It was this order showing the dispersion of his army
over twenty-odd miles of country, with a river flowing between its widely
scattered parts, that by a strange fate fell in McClellan's hands.

General Jackson, after a brief dispatch to General Lee announcing the
capitulation, rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry. The
curiosity of the Union Army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road. Many of them uncovered as he passed, and he
invariably returned the salute. One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: "Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap."

Mr. Lincoln, sir, have you any late news from Mr. Harper's Ferry? I heard
that Stone W. Jackson kept the parole for a few days, and that about
fourteen thousand crossed over in twenty-four hours. He is a smart
ferryman, sure. Do your folks know how to make it pay? It is a bad
crossing, but I suppose it is a heap safer than Ball's Bluff or
Shepherdstown.

The moon, rising above the mountains, revealed the long lines of men and
guns, stretching far across hill and valley, waiting for the dawn to shoot
each other down, and between the armies their dead lay in such numbers as
civilised war has seldom seen. So fearful had been the carnage, and
comprised within such narrow limits, that a Federal patrol, it is related,
passing into the corn-field, where the fighting had been fiercest,
believed that they had surprised a whole Confederate brigade. There, in
the shadow of the woods, lay the skirmishers, their muskets beside them;
and there, in regular ranks, lay the line of battle, sleeping, as it
seemed, the profound sleep of utter exhaustion. But the first man that was
touched was cold and lifeless, and the next, and the next; it was the
bivouac of the dead.

As a deputation from New England was one day leaving the White House, a
delegate turned round and said: "Mr. President, I should much like to know
what you reckon to be the number the rebels have in arms against us?"

Without a moment's hesitation Mr. Lincoln replied: "Sir, I have the best
possible reason for knowing the number to be one million of men, for
whenever one of our generals engages a rebel army he reports that he has
encountered a force twice his strength. I know we have half a million
soldiers, so I am bound to believe that the rebels have twice that
number."

Judged by percentage in killed and wounded, Chickamauga nearly doubled the
sanguinary records of Marengo and Austerlitz; was two and a half times
heavier than that sustained by the Duke of Marlborough at Malplaquet; more
than double that suffered by the army under Henry of Navarre in the
terrific slaughter at Coutras; nearly three times as heavy as the
percentage of loss at Solferino and Magenta; five times greater than that
of Napoleon at Wagram, and about ten times as heavy as that of Marshall
Saxe at Bloody Raucoux.... Or, if we take the average percentage of loss
in a number of the world's great battles--Waterloo, Wagram, Valmy,
Magenta, Solferino, Zurich, and Lodi--we shall find by comparison that
Chickamauga's record of blood surpassed them nearly three for one.

produced individual and unexcelled strains of harmony which have since so
rung in the ears of brother poets that echoes of them may be detected even
in the work of such original and accomplished versemen as Rossetti and
Swinburne. It is no small achievement to have pursued one's ideal until
one's dying day, conscious the while that, great as one's impediments have
been from without, one's chief obstacle has been one's own self.

no, not if it cost me my life. And if your time be passed in the attempt
to so take it, then my time and my every thought shall be spent in
preventing such outrage. Let alone, the Virginian would gladly have made
an end of slavery, but, strange hap, malevolence and meddling bound it up

Of course a transaction so flagitious with its attendant circumstances ...
could but produce the profoundest impression upon the people of the South.
Here was open and armed "aggression"; whether clearly understood and

incursion into a peaceful State.

Her right to it rested upon as firm a basis as the right of any other
Commonwealth to her own domain, and if there was any question of the
Virginia title by charter, she could assert her right by conquest. The
region had been wrested from the British by a Virginian commanding
Virginian troops; the people had taken "the oath of allegiance to the
Commonwealth of Virginia"; and her title to the entire territory was thus
indisputable....

These rights she now abandoned; and her action was the result of an
enlarged patriotism and devotion to the cause of union.

When social relations were resumed between the North and South--they
followed slowly the resumption of business relations--what we should call
the color-blindness of the other side often manifested itself in a
delicate reticence on the part of our Northern friends; and as the war had
by no means constituted their lives as it had constituted ours for four
long years, the success in avoiding the disagreeable topic would have been
considerable, if it had not been for awkward allusions on the part of the
Southerners, who, having been shut out for all that time from the study of
literature and art and other elegant and uncompromising subjects, could
hardly keep from speaking of this and that incident of the war. Whereupon
a discreet, or rather an embarrassed silence, as if a pardoned convict had
playfully referred to the arson or burglary, not to say worse, that had
been the cause of his seclusion.

  A singer gives her soul's wild melody--
  Watching the squirrel store his granary.
  Or, 'mid old orchards, I have pictured thee:
  Thy hair's profusion blown about thy back;
  One lovely shoulder bathed with gypsy black;
  Upon thy palm one nestling cheek, and sweet
  The rosy russets tumbled at thy feet.

  A cricket dirging days that soon must die?

The white people owe a high duty to the negro. It was necessary to the
safety of the State to base suffrage on the capacity to exercise it
wisely. This results in excluding a great number of negroes from the
ballot, but their right to life, liberty, property, and justice must be
even more carefully safeguarded than ever. It is true that a superior race
cannot submit to the rule of a weaker race without injury; it is also true
in the long years of God that the strong cannot oppress the weak without
destruction.

When it was ascertained that exchanges could not be made, either on the

Government their sick and wounded, _without requiring any equivalents_.
Accordingly, in the summer of 1864, I did offer to deliver from ten to
fifteen thousand of the sick and wounded at the mouth of the Savannah
River, without requiring any equivalents, assuring, at the same time, the
Agent of the United States, General Mulford, that if the number for which
he might send transportation could not readily be made up from sick and
wounded, I would supply the difference with well men. Although this offer
was made in the summer of 1864, transportation was not sent to the

Federal prisoners. I offered to pay gold, cotton, or tobacco for them, and

In other words, a veteran of our civil strife, General Sherman advocated
in an enemy's country the sixteenth century practices of Tilly, described
by Schiller, and the later devastation of the Palatinate policy of Louis
XIV, commemorated by Goethe. In the twenty-first century, perhaps,
partisan feeling as regards the Civil War performances having by that time
ceased to exist, American investigators, no longer regardful of a victor's
self-complacency, may treat the episodes of our struggle with the same
even-handed and out-spoken impartiality with which Englishmen now treat
the revenges of the Restoration, or Frenchmen the dragonnades of the Grand
Monarque. But when that time comes, the page relating to what occurred in

page which Mr. Rhodes somewhat lightly passes over--will probably be

immigration and agriculture, all were negroes; both houses of the
legislature had negro presiding officers; in the senate ten negroes held
seats; of the seventy-seven Republicans in the house, fifty-five were

offices were filled by negroes, 90 per cent. of whom could neither read

PROTEST AGAINST THE TARIFF, SOUTH CAROLINA, 1832

The majority in Congress, in imposing protecting duties, which are utterly
destructive of the interests of South Carolina, not only impose no
burthens, but actually confer enriching bounties upon their constituents,
proportioned to the burthens they impose upon us. Under these
circumstances, the principle of representative responsibility is perverted
into a principle of representative despotism. It is this very tie, binding
the majority of Congress to execute the will of their constituents, which
makes them our inexorable oppressors. They dare not open their hearts to
the sentiments of human justice, or to the feelings of human sympathy.
They are tyrants by the very necessity of their position, however elevated
may be their principles in their individual capacities.

PROTEST AGAINST THE WAR OF 1812, NEW ENGLAND

The call of the Secretary of War for the militia of the States met blunt
refusal from the Governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut. The Assembly of the latter State sustained its Executive in a
formal address which denounced the war and declared Connecticut to be a
free, sovereign, and independent State, and that the United States was not
a national but a confederated republic. President Madison was held up as
an invader of the State's authority over her militia.

THE HOMESPUN DRESS

  Oh, yes! I am a Southern girl,
    And glory in the name,
  And boast it with far greater pride
    Than glittering wealth or fame.
  I envy not the Northern girls
    Their robes of beauty rare,
  Though diamonds grace their snowy necks
    And pearls bedeck their hair.

            Hurrah, hurrah!
  For the sunny South so dear.
    Three cheers for the homespun dress
  The Southern ladies wear.

My fellow-people, let me, in conclusion, congratulate you on having a
Governor once more as is a Governor. Oh, there is life in the old land
yet, and by and by we'll transport them black Republicans into the African
desert, and put 'em to teaching Hottentots the right of suffrage. Winter
Davis could then find a field of labor sufficient for the miserable
remnant of his declining years. He is the winter of our discontent, and we
want to get rid of him.

body were members from New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maine, Vermont,
Connecticut, Maryland, District of Columbia, Ireland, Scotland, Nova
Scotia, Canada, England; scalawags, or turn-coats, by Southerners most
hated of all; twenty-four negroes; and in the total of 105, thirty-five
white Virginians, from counties of excess white population, who might be
considered representative of the State's culture and intelligence.

Religion is as necessary to reason as reason is to religion. The one
cannot exist without the other. A reasoning being would lose his reason,
in attempting to account for the great phenomena of nature, had he not a
Supreme Being to refer to; and well has it been said that if there had
been no God mankind would have been obliged to imagine one.

For years after the war, the Republican politicians in the South told the
negroes that if the Democrats were elected, they would be put back into
slavery. Consequently, after the first election of Cleveland, many of them
began to make their arrangements to readapt themselves to the old regime.
One old Virginia "aunty" living in Howard County, Maryland, announced that
she was ready to return to Richmond; but declared most positively: "Deed,

Sir:--If you have no cause to change your opinion respecting your
mechanical boat, and reasons unknown to me do not exist to delay the
exhibition of it, I would advise you to give it to the public as soon as
it can be prepared conveniently.... Should a mechanical genius hit upon
your plan, or something similar to it, I need not add that it would place
you in an awkward situation and perhaps disconcert all your prospects
concerning this useful discovery....

Mr. Rumsey's steamboat, with more than half her loading (which was upwards
of three ton) and a number of people on board, made a progress of four
miles in one hour against the current of Potomac River, by the force of
steam, without any external application whatsoever.

I have taken the greatest pains to perfect another kind of boat, _upon the
principles I mentioned to you at Richmond_, in November last, and have the
pleasure to inform you that I have brought it to a great perfection ...
and I have quite convinced myself that boats of passage may be made to go
against the current of the _Mississippi_ or _Ohio_ rivers, or in the _Gulf
Stream_ (from the _Leeward_ to the _Windward_-Islands) from sixty to one
hundred miles per day. I know this will appear strange and improbable to
many persons, yet I am very certain it may be performed, besides, it is
simple (when understood) and is also strictly philosophical.

On part of the field the Union dead lay three deep. So fearful was the
slaughter that our men at certain points on the line cried out to the
advancing Federal forces, "Go back; we don't want to kill you all!" Still
they pressed forward in the face of despair, and they fell in the
unshrinking station where they fought. In six months Lee had effaced Pope,
checked McClellan, and crushed Burnside--June 25 to December 13, 1862.

The Convention of 1787 was composed of members, a majority of whom were
elected to reject the Federal Constitution; and it was only after the
clause declaring that "the power granted under the Constitution being
derived from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them
whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury and oppression, and
that every power not granted thereby remains with them at their will," was
inserted in the ordinance of ratification, that six or more of the
majority opposed to the measure consented to vote for it. Even with this
accession of strength the Constitution was carried only by a vote of 89 to
79.

  Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,
  As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud,
  That floats so still and placidly through heaven,
  The spirits of the seasons seem to stand--
  Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,
  And Winter, with his aged locks--and breathe
  In mournful cadences, that come abroad
  Like the far wind harp's wild and touching wail,
  A melancholy dirge o'er the dead Year,
  Gone from the earth forever.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
