Book 19 Psalms
001:001 Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked,
        nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
001:002 but his delight is in Yahweh's law.  On his law he meditates
        day and night.
001:003 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings
        forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither.
        Whatever he does shall prosper.
001:004 The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the
        wind drives away.
001:005 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
        nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
001:006 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way
        of the wicked shall perish.
002:001 Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
002:002 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take
        counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,{The
        word "Anointed" is the same as the word for "Messiah"
        or "Christ"} saying,
002:003 "Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us."
002:004 He who sits in the heavens will laugh.  The Lord will have
        them in derision.
002:005 Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them
        in his wrath:
002:006 "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."
002:007 I will tell of the decree.  Yahweh said to me, "You are my son.
        Today I have become your father.
002:008 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,
        the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
002:009 You shall break them with a rod of iron.  You shall dash them
        in pieces like a potter's vessel."
002:010 Now therefore be wise, you kings.  Be instructed, you judges
        of the earth.
002:011 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
002:012 Give sincere homage{or, Kiss the son}, lest he be angry,
        and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled.
        Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
003:001 <<A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.>> Yahweh,
        how my adversaries have increased!  Many are those who rise
        up against me.
003:002 Many there are who say of my soul, "There is no help for him
        in God."  Selah.
003:003 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one
        who lifts up my head.
003:004 I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his
        holy hill.  Selah.
003:005 I laid myself down and slept.  I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
003:006 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have
        set themselves against me on every side.
003:007 Arise, Yahweh!  Save me, my God!  For you have struck all
        of my enemies on the cheek bone.  You have broken the teeth
        of the wicked.
003:008 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.  Your blessing be on
        your people.  Selah.
004:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments.  A Psalm
        by David.>> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
        Give me relief from my distress.  Have mercy on me,
        and hear my prayer.
004:002 You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
        Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?  Selah.
004:003 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:
        Yahweh will hear when I call to him.
004:004 Stand in awe, and don't sin.  Search your own heart on your bed,
        and be still.  Selah.
004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.  Put your trust in Yahweh.
004:006 Many say, "Who will show us any good?"  Yahweh, let the light
        of your face shine on us.
004:007 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain
        and their new wine are increased.
004:008 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you,
        Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.
005:001 <<For the Chief Musician, with the flutes.  A Psalm by David.>>
        Give ear to my words, Yahweh.  Consider my meditation.
005:002 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you
        do I pray.
005:003 Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice.  In the morning
        I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
005:004 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.
        Evil can't live with you.
005:005 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.  You hate all
        workers of iniquity.
005:006 You will destroy those who speak lies.  Yahweh abhors
        the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
005:007 But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I
        will come into your house.  I will bow toward your holy temple
        in reverence of you.
005:008 Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies.
        Make your way straight before my face.
005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.
        Their heart is destruction.  Their throat is an open tomb.
        They flatter with their tongue.
005:010 Hold them guilty, God.  Let them fall by their own counsels;
        Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,
        for they have rebelled against you.
005:011 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,
        Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.
        Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
005:012 For you will bless the righteous.  Yahweh, you will surround
        him with favor as with a shield.
006:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments,
        upon the eight-stringed lyre.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,
        don't rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me
        in your wrath.
006:002 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.  Yahweh, heal me,
        for my bones are troubled.
006:003 My soul is also in great anguish.  But you, Yahweh--how long?
006:004 Return, Yahweh.  Deliver my soul, and save me for your
        loving kindness' sake.
006:005 For in death there is no memory of you.  In Sheol, who shall
        give you thanks?
006:006 I am weary with my groaning.  Every night I flood my bed.
        I drench my couch with my tears.
006:007 My eye wastes away because of grief.  It grows old because of
        all my adversaries.
006:008 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has
        heard the voice of my weeping.
006:009 Yahweh has heard my supplication.  Yahweh accepts my prayer.
006:010 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.  They shall turn back,
        they shall be disgraced suddenly.
007:001 <<A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words
        of Cush, the Benjamite.>> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you.
        Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
007:002 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces,
        while there is none to deliver.
007:003 Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity
        in my hands,
007:004 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I
        have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
007:005 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread
        my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.  Selah.
007:006 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger.  Lift up yourself against the rage
        of my adversaries.  Awake for me.  You have commanded judgment.
007:007 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.
        Rule over them on high.
007:008 Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples.  Judge me,
        Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity
        that is in me.
007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,
        but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched
        by the righteous God.
007:010 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
007:011 God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.
007:012 If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has
        bent and strung his bow.
007:013 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.
        He makes ready his flaming arrows.
007:014 Behold, he travails with iniquity.  Yes, he has conceived mischief,
        and brought forth falsehood.
007:015 He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.
007:016 The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.
        His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.
007:017 I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness,
        and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
008:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath.
        A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name
        in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!
008:002 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
        because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy
        and the avenger.
008:003 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
        the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
008:004 what is man, that you think of him?  What is the son of man,
        that you care for him?
008:005 For you have made him a little lower than God,{Hebrew: Elohim}
        and crowned him with glory and honor.
008:006 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
        You have put all things under his feet:
008:007 All sheep and oxen, yes, and the animals of the field,
008:008 The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes
        through the paths of the seas.
008:009 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
009:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  Set to "The Death of the Son."
        A Psalm by David.>> I will give thanks to Yahweh with my
        whole heart.  I will tell of all your marvelous works.
009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in you.  I will sing praise to your name,
        O Most High.
009:003 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.
009:004 For you have maintained my just cause.  You sit on the
        throne judging righteously.
009:005 You have rebuked the nations.  You have destroyed the wicked.
        You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
009:006 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.  The very memory
        of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.
009:007 But Yahweh reigns forever.  He has prepared his throne for judgment.
009:008 He will judge the world in righteousness.  He will administer
        judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
009:009 Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high
        tower in times of trouble.
009:010 Those who know your name will put their trust in you,
        for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.
009:011 Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among
        the people what he has done.
009:012 For he who avenges blood remembers them.  He doesn't forget
        the cry of the afflicted.
009:013 Have mercy on me, Yahweh.  See my affliction by those who hate me,
        and lift me up from the gates of death;
009:014 that I may show forth all your praise.  In the gates of
        the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.
009:015 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.
        In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
009:016 Yahweh has made himself known.  He has executed judgment.  The wicked
        is snared by the work of his own hands.  Meditation.  Selah.
009:017 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations
        that forget God.
009:018 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope
        of the poor perish forever.
009:019 Arise, Yahweh!  Don't let man prevail.  Let the nations be
        judged in your sight.
009:020 Put them in fear, Yahweh.  Let the nations know that they
        are only men.  Selah.
010:001 Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?  Why do you hide yourself
        in times of trouble?
010:002 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.  They are caught
        in the schemes that they devise.
010:003 For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings.  He blesses
        the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.
010:004 The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his
        thoughts for God.
010:005 His ways are prosperous at all times.  He is haughty, and your
        laws are far from his sight.  As for all his adversaries,
        he sneers at them.
010:006 He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken.  For generations
        I shall have no trouble."
010:007 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.
        Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
010:008 He lies in wait near the villages.  From ambushes, he murders
        the innocent.  His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
010:009 He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.  He lies in wait
        to catch the helpless.  He catches the helpless, when he draws
        him in his net.
010:010 The helpless are crushed.  They collapse.  They fall
        under his strength.
010:011 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten.  He hides his face.
        He will never see it."
010:012 Arise, Yahweh!  God, lift up your hand!  Don't forget the helpless.
010:013 Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart,
        "God won't call me into account?"
010:014 But you do see trouble and grief.  You consider it to take it
        into your hand.  You help the victim and the fatherless.
010:015 Break the arm of the wicked.  As for the evil man, seek out
        his wickedness until you find none.
010:016 Yahweh is King forever and ever!  The nations will perish
        out of his land.
010:017 Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble.
        You will prepare their heart.  You will cause your ear to hear,
010:018 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is
        of the earth may terrify no more.
011:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.>> In Yahweh, I take refuge.
        How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"
011:002 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.  They set their
        arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at
        the upright in heart.
011:003 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
011:004 Yahweh is in his holy temple.  Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.
        His eyes observe.  His eyes examine the children of men.
011:005 Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and him who loves
        violence his soul hates.
011:006 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur,
        and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
011:007 For Yahweh is righteous.  He loves righteousness.
        The upright shall see his face.
012:001 <<For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre.
        A Psalm of David.>> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.
        For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
012:002 Everyone lies to his neighbor.  They speak with flattering lips,
        and with a double heart.
012:003 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,
012:004 who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail.
        Our lips are our own.  Who is lord over us?"
012:005 "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning
        of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set
        him in safety from those who malign him."
012:006 The words of Yahweh are flawless words, as silver refined
        in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
012:007 You will keep them, Yahweh.  You will preserve them from
        this generation forever.
012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted
        among the sons of men.
013:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>>
        How long, Yahweh?  Will you forget me forever?
        How long will you hide your face from me?
013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
        heart every day?  How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
013:003 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.  Give light to my eyes,
        lest I sleep in death;
013:004 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" Lest my
        adversaries rejoice when I fall.
013:005 But I trust in your loving kindness.  My heart rejoices
        in your salvation.
013:006 I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
014:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.>> The fool has said
        in his heart, "There is no God."  They are corrupt.
        They have done abominable works.  There is none who does good.
014:002 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see
        if there were any who did understand, who did seek after God.
014:003 They have all gone aside.  They have together become corrupt.
        There is none who does good, no, not one.
014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up
        my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh?
014:005 There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation
        of the righteous.
014:006 You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.
014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  When Yahweh
        restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice,
        and Israel shall be glad.
015:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?
        Who shall live on your holy hill?
015:002 He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth
        in his heart;
015:003 He who doesn't slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend,
        nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
015:004 In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those
        who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
        and doesn't change;
015:005 he who doesn't lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe
        against the innocent.  He who does these things shall
        never be shaken.
016:001 <<A Poem by David.>> Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.
016:002 My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Lord.
        Apart from you I have no good thing."
016:003 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent
        ones in whom is all my delight.
016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.
        Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take
        their names on my lips.
016:005 Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.  You made my lot secure.
016:006 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.  Yes, I have
        a good inheritance.
016:007 I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel.  Yes, my heart
        instructs me in the night seasons.
016:008 I have set Yahweh always before me.  Because he is at my right hand,
        I shall not be moved.
016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.
        My body shall also dwell in safety.
016:010 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you
        allow your holy one to see corruption.
016:011 You will show me the path of life.  In your presence is fullness
        of joy.  In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
017:001 <<A Prayer by David.>> Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea;
        Give ear to my prayer, that doesn't go out of deceitful lips.
017:002 Let my sentence come forth from your presence.  Let your eyes
        look on equity.
017:003 You have proved my heart.  You have visited me in the night.
        You have tried me, and found nothing.  I have resolved that my
        mouth shall not disobey.
017:004 As for the works of men, by the word of your lips, I have kept
        myself from the ways of the violent.
017:005 My steps have held fast to your paths.  My feet have not slipped.
017:006 I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.  Turn your
        ear to me.  Hear my speech.
017:007 Show your marvelous loving kindness, you who save those who take
        refuge by your right hand from their enemies.
017:008 Keep me as the apple of your eye.  Hide me under the shadow
        of your wings,
017:009 from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies,
        who surround me.
017:010 They close up their callous hearts.  With their mouth
        they speak proudly.
017:011 They have now surrounded us in our steps.  They set their eyes
        to cast us down to the earth.
017:012 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, as it were a young
        lion lurking in secret places.
017:013 Arise, Yahweh, confront him.  Cast him down.  Deliver my soul
        from the wicked by your sword;
017:014 from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of the world, whose portion
        is in this life.  You fill the belly of your cherished ones.
        Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.
017:015 As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.
        I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
018:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David the servant of Yahweh, who spoke
        to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered
        him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
        He said,>> I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
018:002 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock,
        in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
        my high tower.
018:003 I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved
        from my enemies.
018:004 The cords of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
018:005 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death
        came on me.
018:006 In my distress I called on Yahweh, and cried to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry before him came
        into his ears.
018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations also of
        the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
018:008 Smoke went out of his nostrils.  Consuming fire came out
        of his mouth.  Coals were kindled by it.
018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
018:010 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he soared on the wings
        of the wind.
018:011 He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,
        darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
018:012 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
        hailstones and coals of fire.
018:013 Yahweh also thundered in the sky.  The Most High uttered his voice:
        hailstones and coals of fire.
018:014 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, great lightning
        bolts, and routed them.
018:015 Then the channels of waters appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at the blast
        of the breath of your nostrils.
018:016 He sent from on high.  He took me.  He drew me out of many waters.
018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me;
        for they were too mighty for me.
018:018 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
018:020 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
018:021 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
018:022 For all his ordinances were before me.  I didn't put away
        his statutes from me.
018:023 I was also blameless with him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
018:024 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
        according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
018:025 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
        With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
018:026 With the pure, you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
        you will show yourself shrewd.
018:027 For you will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes
        you will bring down.
018:028 For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.  My God will light
        up my darkness.
018:029 For by you, I advance through a troop.  By my God, I leap
        over a wall.
018:030 As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tried.
        He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
018:031 For who is God, except Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God,
018:032 the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
018:033 He makes my feet like deer's feet, and sets me on my high places.
018:034 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
018:035 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
        Your right hand sustains me.  Your gentleness has made me great.
018:036 You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.
018:037 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.  Neither will I
        turn again until they are consumed.
018:038 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
        They shall fall under my feet.
018:039 For you have girded me with strength to the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
018:040 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        might cut off those who hate me.
018:041 They cried, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
        but he didn't answer them.
018:042 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
        I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
018:043 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
        You have made me the head of the nations.  A people whom I
        have not known shall serve me.
018:044 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.  The foreigners
        shall submit themselves to me.
018:045 The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out
        of their close places.
018:046 Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.  Exalted be the God
        of my salvation,
018:047 even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues
        peoples under me.
018:048 He rescues me from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up above those
        who rise up against me.  You deliver me from the violent man.
018:049 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
        and will sing praises to your name.
018:050 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
        to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
019:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> The heavens
        declare the glory of God.  The expanse shows his handiwork.
019:002 Day after day they pour forth speech, and night after night
        they display knowledge.
019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
019:004 Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words
        to the end of the world.  In them he has set a tent for the sun,
019:005 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a strong
        man rejoicing to run his course.
019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, his circuit
        to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.
019:007 Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul.  Yahweh's testimony
        is sure, making wise the simple.
019:008 Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.
        Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.
019:009 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.
        Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.
019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold;
        sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
019:011 Moreover by them is your servant warned.  In keeping them
        there is great reward.
019:012 Who can discern his errors?  Forgive me from hidden errors.
019:013 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.
        Let them not have dominion over me.  Then I will be upright.
        I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
019:014 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be
        acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
020:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> May Yahweh
        answer you in the day of trouble.  May the name of the God
        of Jacob set you up on high,
020:002 send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion,
020:003 remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice.  Selah.
020:004 May He grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill all your counsel.
020:005 We will triumph in your salvation.  In the name of our God,
        we will set up our banners.  May Yahweh grant all your requests.
020:006 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.  He will answer him
        from his holy heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand.
020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust
        the name of Yahweh our God.
020:008 They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.
020:009 Save, Yahweh!  Let the King answer us when we call!
021:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> The king
        rejoices in your strength, Yahweh!  How greatly he rejoices
        in your salvation!
021:002 You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld
        the request of his lips.  Selah.
021:003 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.
        You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
021:004 He asked life of you, you gave it to him, even length of days
        forever and ever.
021:005 His glory is great in your salvation.  You lay honor and
        majesty on him.
021:006 For you make him most blessed forever.  You make him glad
        with joy in your presence.
021:007 For the king trusts in Yahweh.  Through the loving kindness
        of the Most High, he shall not be moved.
021:008 Your hand will find out all of your enemies.  Your right hand
        will find out those who hate you.
021:009 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.
        Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath.  The fire
        shall devour them.
021:010 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity
        from among the children of men.
021:011 For they intended evil against you.  They plotted evil against
        you which cannot succeed.
021:012 For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn
        bows at their face.
021:013 Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and
        praise your power.
022:001 <<For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning."
        A Psalm by David.>> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
        Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words
        of my groaning?
022:002 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don't answer;
        in the night season, and am not silent.
022:003 But you are holy, you who inhabit the praises of Israel.
022:004 Our fathers trusted in you.  They trusted, and you delivered them.
022:005 They cried to you, and were delivered.  They trusted in you,
        and were not disappointed.
022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
        by the people.
022:007 All those who see me mock me.  They insult me with their lips.
        They shake their heads, saying,
022:008 "He trusts in Yahweh; let him deliver him.  Let him rescue him,
        since he delights in him."
022:009 But you brought me out of the womb.  You made me trust at
        my mother's breasts.
022:010 I was thrown on you from my mother's womb.  You are my God
        since my mother bore me.
022:011 Don't be far from me, for trouble is near.  For there is
        none to help.
022:012 Many bulls have surrounded me.  Strong bulls of Bashan
        have encircled me.
022:013 They open their mouths wide against me, lions tearing
        prey and roaring.
022:014 I am poured out like water.  All my bones are out of joint.
        My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.
022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.  My tongue sticks
        to the roof of my mouth.  You have brought me into the
        dust of death.
022:016 For dogs have surrounded me.  A company of evil-doers have
        enclosed me.  Like a lion, they pin my hands and feet.{or,
        They have pierced my hands and feet.  (DSS)}
022:017 I can count all of my bones.  They look and stare at me.
022:018 They divide my garments among them.  They cast lots for my clothing.
022:019 But don't be far off, Yahweh.  You are my help:
        hurry to help me.
022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power
        of the dog.
022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth!  Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen,
        you have answered me.
022:022 I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst
        of the assembly, I will praise you.
022:023 You who fear Yahweh, praise him!  All you descendants of Jacob,
        glorify him!  Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!
022:024 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of
        the afflicted, Neither has he hidden his face from him;
        but when he cried to him, he heard.
022:025 Of you comes my praise in the great assembly.  I will pay
        my vows before those who fear him.
022:026 The humble shall eat and be satisfied.  They shall praise
        Yahweh who seek after him.  Let your hearts live forever.
022:027 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.
        All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.
022:028 For the kingdom is Yahweh's. He is the ruler over the nations.
022:029 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.
        All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,
        even he who can't keep his soul alive.
022:030 Posterity shall serve him.  Future generations shall be told
        about the Lord.
022:031 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people
        that shall be born, for he has done it.
023:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh is my shepherd:  I shall lack nothing.
023:002 He makes me lie down in green pastures.  He leads me
        beside still waters.
023:003 He restores my soul.  He guides me in the paths of righteousness
        for his name's sake.
023:004 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
        I will fear no evil, for you are with me.  Your rod and your staff,
        they comfort me.
023:005 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
        You anoint my head with oil.  My cup runs over.
023:006 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days
        of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh's house forever.
024:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness;
        the world, and those who dwell therein.
024:002 For he has founded it on the seas, and established it
        on the floods.
024:003 Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill?  Who may stand in his holy place?
024:004 He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted
        up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.
024:005 He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, righteousness from
        the God of his salvation.
024:006 This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face--
        even Jacob.  Selah.
024:007 Lift up your heads, you gates!  Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,
        and the King of glory will come in.
024:008 Who is the King of glory?  Yahweh strong and mighty,
        Yahweh mighty in battle.
024:009 Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up,
        you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.
024:010 Who is this King of glory?  Yahweh of Armies is the King
        of glory!  Selah.
025:001 <<By David.>> To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.
025:002 My God, I have trusted in you.  Don't let me be shamed.
        Don't let my enemies triumph over me.
025:003 Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed.  They shall
        be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
025:004 Show me your ways, Yahweh.  Teach me your paths.
025:005 Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For you are the God
        of my salvation, I wait for you all day long.
025:006 Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,
        for they are from old times.
025:007 Don't remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.
        Remember me according to your loving kindness,
        for your goodness' sake, Yahweh.
025:008 Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he will instruct sinners
        in the way.
025:009 He will guide the humble in justice.  He will teach
        the humble his way.
025:010 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such
        as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
025:011 For your name's sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
025:012 What man is he who fears Yahweh?  He shall instruct him
        in the way that he shall choose.
025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease.  His seed shall inherit the land.
025:014 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him.
        He will show them his covenant.
025:015 My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will pluck my feet out
        of the net.
025:016 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.
025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged.  Oh bring me out
        of my distresses.
025:018 Consider my affliction and my travail.  Forgive all my sins.
025:019 Consider my enemies, for they are many.  They hate me
        with cruel hatred.
025:020 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.  Let me not be disappointed,
        for I take refuge in you.
025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
025:022 Redeem Israel, God, out all of his troubles.
026:001 <<By David.>> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.
        I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
026:002 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.  Try my heart and my mind.
026:003 For your loving kindness is before my eyes.  I have walked
        in your truth.
026:004 I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go
        in with hypocrites.
026:005 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
026:006 I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about
        your altar, Yahweh;
026:007 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,
        and tell of all your wondrous works.
026:008 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where
        your glory dwells.
026:009 Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
026:010 in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.
026:011 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.  Redeem me,
        and be merciful to me.
026:012 My foot stands in an even place.  In the congregations I
        will bless Yahweh.
027:001 <<By David.>> Yahweh is my light and my salvation.
        Whom shall I fear?  Yahweh is the strength of my life.
        Of whom shall I be afraid?
027:002 When evil-doers came at me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries
        and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
027:003 Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
        Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
027:004 One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after,
        that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life,
        to see Yahweh's beauty, and to inquire in his temple.
027:005 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.
        In the covert of his tent he will hide me.  He will lift me
        up on a rock.
027:006 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.
        I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.  I will sing,
        yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
027:007 Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.  Have mercy also on me,
        and answer me.
027:008 When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you, "I will
        seek your face, Yahweh."
027:009 Don't hide your face from me.  Don't put your servant away in anger.
        You have been my help.  Don't abandon me, neither forsake me,
        God of my salvation.
027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will
        take me up.
027:011 Teach me your way, Yahweh.  Lead me in a straight path,
        because of my enemies.
027:012 Don't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false
        witnesses have risen up against me, such as breathe out cruelty.
027:013 I am still confident of this:  I will see the goodness of Yahweh
        in the land of the living.
027:014 Wait for Yahweh.  Be strong, and let your heart take courage.
        Yes, wait for Yahweh.
028:001 <<By David.>> To you, Yahweh, I call.  My rock, don't be
        deaf to me; lest, if you are silent to me, I would become
        like those who go down into the pit.
028:002 Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, when I lift
        up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
028:003 Don't draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of
        iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief
        is in their hearts.
028:004 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of
        their doings.  Give them according to the operation of their hands.
        Bring back on them what they deserve.
028:005 Because they don't regard the works of Yahweh, nor the operation
        of his hands, he will break them down and not build them up.
028:006 Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my petitions.
028:007 Yahweh is my strength and my shield.  My heart has trusted in him,
        and I am helped.  Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.
        With my song I will thank him.
028:008 Yahweh is their strength.  He is a stronghold of salvation
        to his anointed.
028:009 Save your people, and bless your inheritance.  Be their
        shepherd also, and bear them up forever.
029:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty,
        ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
029:002 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Worship Yahweh
        in holy array.
029:003 Yahweh's voice is on the waters.  The God of glory thunders,
        even Yahweh on many waters.
029:004 Yahweh's voice is powerful.  Yahweh's voice is full of majesty.
029:005 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars.  Yes, Yahweh breaks
        in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
029:006 He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
        like a young, wild ox.
029:007 Yahweh's voice strikes with flashes of lightning.
029:008 Yahweh's voice shakes the wilderness.  Yahweh shakes
        the wilderness of Kadesh.
029:009 Yahweh's voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare.
        In his temple everything says, "Glory!"
029:010 Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood.  Yes, Yahweh sits
        as King forever.
029:011 Yahweh will give strength to his people.  Yahweh will bless
        his people with peace.
030:001 <<A Psalm.  A Song for the Dedication of the Temple.
        By David.>> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up,
        and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
030:002 Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.
030:003 Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.
        You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
030:004 Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his.  Give thanks
        to his holy name.
030:005 For his anger is but for a moment.  His favor is for a lifetime.
        Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
030:006 As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."
030:007 You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong;
        but when you hid your face, I was troubled.
030:008 I cried to you, Yahweh.  To Yahweh I made supplication:
030:009 "What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?
        Shall the dust praise you?  Shall it declare your truth?
030:010 Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me.  Yahweh, be my helper."
030:011 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.
        You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
030:012 To the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.
        Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
031:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> In you,
        Yahweh, I take refuge.  Let me never be disappointed.
        Deliver me in your righteousness.
031:002 Bow down your ear to me.  Deliver me speedily.  Be to me
        a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.
031:003 For you are my rock and my fortress, therefore for your name's
        sake lead me and guide me.
031:004 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
        for you are my stronghold.
031:005 Into your hand I commend my spirit.  You redeem me,
        Yahweh, God of truth.
031:006 I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in Yahweh.
031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness, for you have
        seen my affliction.  You have known my soul in adversities.
031:008 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
        You have set my feet in a large place.
031:009 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.  My eye,
        my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
031:010 For my life is spent with sorrow, my years with sighing.
        My strength fails because of my iniquity.  My bones
        are wasted away.
031:011 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly
        contemptible to my neighbors, A fear to my acquaintances.
        Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
031:012 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.
        I am like broken pottery.
031:013 For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,
        while they conspire together against me, they plot to take
        away my life.
031:014 But I trust in you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my God."
031:015 My times are in your hand.  Deliver me from the hand of my enemies,
        and from those who persecute me.
031:016 Make your face to shine on your servant.  Save me in
        your loving kindness.
031:017 Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you.
        Let the wicked be disappointed.  Let them be silent in Sheol.
031:018 Let the lying lips be mute, which speak against the righteous
        insolently, with pride and contempt.
031:019 Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for
        those who fear you, which you have worked for those who take
        refuge in you, before the sons of men!
031:020 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from
        the plotting of man.  You will keep them secretly in a dwelling
        away from the strife of tongues.
031:021 Praise be to Yahweh, for he has shown me his marvelous loving
        kindness in a strong city.
031:022 As for me, I said in my haste, "I am cut off from before your eyes."
        Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I
        cried to you.
031:023 Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints!  Yahweh preserves the faithful,
        and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.
031:024 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who
        hope in Yahweh.
032:001 <<By David.  A contemplative psalm.>> Blessed is he whose
        disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
032:002 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity,
        in whose spirit there is no deceit.
032:003 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning
        all day long.
032:004 For day and night your hand was heavy on me.  My strength
        was sapped in the heat of summer.  Selah.
032:005 I acknowledged my sin to you.  I didn't hide my iniquity.
        I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you
        forgave the iniquity of my sin.  Selah.
032:006 For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time
        when you may be found.  Surely when the great waters overflow,
        they shall not reach to him.
032:007 You are my hiding place.  You will preserve me from trouble.
        You will surround me with songs of deliverance.  Selah.
032:008 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.
        I will counsel you with my eye on you.
032:009 Don't be like the horse, or like the mule, which have
        no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle,
        or else they will not come near to you.
032:010 Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving kindness shall
        surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
032:011 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!  Shout for joy,
        all you who are upright in heart!
033:001 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous!  Praise is fitting
        for the upright.
033:002 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.  Sing praises to him
        with the harp of ten strings.
033:003 Sing to him a new song.  Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
033:004 For the word of Yahweh is right.  All his work is
        done in faithfulness.
033:005 He loves righteousness and justice.  The earth is full
        of the loving kindness of Yahweh.
033:006 By Yahweh's word, the heavens were made; all their army
        by the breath of his mouth.
033:007 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.
        He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
033:008 Let all the earth fear Yahweh.  Let all the inhabitants
        of the world stand in awe of him.
033:009 For he spoke, and it was done.  He commanded, and it stood firm.
033:010 Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
        He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
033:011 The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, the thoughts of his
        heart to all generations.
033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people whom
        he has chosen for his own inheritance.
033:013 Yahweh looks from heaven.  He sees all the sons of men.
033:014 From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants
        of the earth,
033:015 he who fashions all of their hearts; and he considers all
        of their works.
033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.
        A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
033:017 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does he deliver
        any by his great power.
033:018 Behold, Yahweh's eye is on those who fear him, on those who hope
        in his loving kindness;
033:019 to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.
033:020 Our soul has waited for Yahweh.  He is our help and our shield.
033:021 For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted
        in his holy name.
033:022 Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, since we have hoped
        in you.  {}
034:001 <<By David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech,
        who drove him away, and he departed.Psalm 34 is an acrostic poem,
        with each verse starting with a letter of the alphabet
        (ordered from Alef to Tav).>> I will bless Yahweh at all times.
        His praise will always be in my mouth.
034:002 My soul shall boast in Yahweh.  The humble shall hear of it,
        and be glad.
034:003 Oh magnify Yahweh with me.  Let us exalt his name together.
034:004 I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, and delivered me from
        all my fears.
034:005 They looked to him, and were radiant.  Their faces shall
        never be covered with shame.
034:006 This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him, and saved him out
        of all his troubles.
034:007 The angel of Yahweh encamps round about those who fear him,
        and delivers them.
034:008 Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.  Blessed is the man
        who takes refuge in him.
034:009 Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack with
        those who fear him.
034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek
        Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.
034:011 Come, you children, listen to me.  I will teach you
        the fear of Yahweh.
034:012 Who is someone who desires life, and loves many days,
        that he may see good?
034:013 Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking lies.
034:014 Depart from evil, and do good.  seek peace, and pursue it.
034:015 Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous.  His ears listen
        to their cry.
034:016 Yahweh's face is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory
        of them from the earth.
034:017 The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, and delivers them out
        of all their troubles.
034:018 Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves
        those who have a crushed spirit.
034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers
        him out of them all.
034:020 He protects all of his bones.  Not one of them is broken.
034:021 Evil shall kill the wicked.  Those who hate the righteous
        shall be condemned.
034:022 Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.  None of those who take
        refuge in him shall be condemned.
035:001 <<By David.>> Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me.
        Fight against those who fight against me.
035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
035:003 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.
        Tell my soul, "I am your salvation."
035:004 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought
        to dishonor.  Let those who plot my ruin be turned
        back and confounded.
035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind, Yahweh's angel
        driving them on.
035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery, Yahweh's angel pursuing them.
035:007 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.
        Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.
035:008 Let destruction come on him unawares.  Let his net that he has
        hidden catch himself.  Let him fall into that destruction.
035:009 My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh.  It shall rejoice
        in his salvation.
035:010 All my bones shall say, "Yahweh, who is like you, who delivers
        the poor from him who is too strong for him; yes, the poor
        and the needy from him who robs him?"
035:011 Unrighteous witnesses rise up.  They ask me about things that I
        don't know about.
035:012 They reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul.
035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.
        I afflicted my soul with fasting.  My prayer returned into
        my own bosom.
035:014 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.
        I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.
035:015 But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.
        The attackers gathered themselves together against me,
        and I didn't know it.  They tore at me, and didn't cease.
035:016 Like the profane mockers in feasts, they gnashed their
        teeth at me.
035:017 Lord, how long will you look on?  Rescue my soul from
        their destruction, my precious life from the lions.
035:018 I will give you thanks in the great assembly.  I will praise
        you among many people.
035:019 Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
        neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
035:020 For they don't speak peace, but they devise deceitful words
        against those who are quiet in the land.
035:021 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.
        They said, "Aha!  Aha!  Our eye has seen it!"
035:022 You have seen it, Yahweh.  Don't keep silent.  Lord, don't be
        far from me.
035:023 Wake up!  Rise up to defend me, my God!  My Lord, contend for me!
035:024 Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness.
        Don't let them gloat over me.
035:025 Don't let them say in their heart, "Aha!  That's the way we want it!"
        Don't let them say, "We have swallowed him up!"
035:026 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice
        at my calamity.  Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor
        who magnify themselves against me.
035:027 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause.
        Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be magnified, who has
        pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!"
035:028 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your
        praise all day long.
036:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David, the servant of Yahweh.>> An
        oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:
        "There is no fear of God before his eyes."
036:002 For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect
        and hate his sin.
036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.
        He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
036:004 He plots iniquity on his bed.  He sets himself in a way that is
        not good.  He doesn't abhor evil.
036:005 Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.
        Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
036:006 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.
        Your judgments are like a great deep.  Yahweh, you preserve
        man and animal.
036:007 How precious is your loving kindness, God!  The children of men
        take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.
        You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
036:009 For with you is the spring of life.  In your light shall
        we see light.
036:010 Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,
        your righteousness to the upright in heart.
036:011 Don't let the foot of pride come against me.  Don't let the hand
        of the wicked drive me away.
036:012 There the workers of iniquity are fallen.  They are thrust down,
        and shall not be able to rise.
037:001 <<By David.>> Don't fret because of evil-doers, neither be
        envious against those who work unrighteousness.
037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither
        like the green herb.
037:003 Trust in Yahweh, and do good.  Dwell in the land,
        and enjoy safe pasture.
037:004 Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and he will give you the desires
        of your heart.
037:005 Commit your way to Yahweh.  Trust also in him, and he will do this:
037:006 he will make your righteousness go forth as the light,
        and your justice as the noon day sun.
037:007 Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.  Don't fret
        because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man
        who makes wicked plots happen.
037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.  Don't fret, it leads
        only to evildoing.
037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh
        shall inherit the land.
037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.
        Yes, though you look for his place, he isn't there.
037:011 But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight
        themselves in the abundance of peace.
037:012 The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him
        with his teeth.
037:013 The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.
037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
        to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright
        in the way.
037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart.  Their bows
        shall be broken.
037:016 Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance
        of many wicked.
037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh
        upholds the righteous.
037:018 Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.  Their inheritance
        shall be forever.
037:019 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.
        In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
037:020 But the wicked shall perish.  The enemies of Yahweh shall
        be like the beauty of the fields.  They will vanish--
        vanish like smoke.
037:021 The wicked borrow, and don't pay back, but the righteous
        give generously.
037:022 For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.
        Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
037:023 A man's goings are established by Yahweh.  He delights
        in his way.
037:024 Though he stumble, he shall not fall, for Yahweh holds him up
        with his hand.
037:025 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen
        the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging for bread.
037:026 All day long he deals graciously, and lends.  His seed is blessed.
037:027 Depart from evil, and do good.  Live securely forever.
037:028 For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn't forsake his saints.
        They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked
        shall be cut off.
037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.
037:030 The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.
        His tongue speaks justice.
037:031 The law of his God is in his heart.  None of his steps shall slide.
037:032 The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.
037:033 Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
        he is judged.
037:034 Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, and he will exalt
        you to inherit the land.  When the wicked are cut off,
        you shall see it.
037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself
        like a green tree in its native soil.
037:036 But he passed away, and behold, he was not.  Yes, I sought him,
        but he could not be found.
037:037 Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for there is a future
        for the man of peace.
037:038 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.
        The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.
        He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
037:040 Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.  He rescues them from the wicked,
        and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
038:001 <<A Psalm by David, for a memorial.>> Yahweh, don't rebuke me
        in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
038:002 For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.
038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
        neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
038:004 For my iniquities have gone over my head.  As a heavy burden,
        they are too heavy for me.
038:005 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
038:006 I am pained and bowed down greatly.  I go mourning all day long.
038:007 For my waist is filled with burning.  There is no soundness
        in my flesh.
038:008 I am faint and severely bruised.  I have groaned by reason
        of the anguish of my heart.
038:009 Lord, all my desire is before you.  My groaning is not
        hidden from you.
038:010 My heart throbs.  My strength fails me.  As for the light
        of my eyes, it has also left me.
038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.
        My kinsmen stand far away.
038:012 They also who seek after my life lay snares.  Those who seek
        my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits
        all day long.
038:013 But I, as a deaf man, don't hear.  I am as a mute man who doesn't
        open his mouth.
038:014 Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs.
038:015 For in you, Yahweh, do I hope.  You will answer, Lord my God.
038:016 For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves
        over me when my foot slips."
038:017 For I am ready to fall.  My pain is continually before me.
038:018 For I will declare my iniquity.  I will be sorry for my sin.
038:019 But my enemies are vigorous and many.  Those who hate me
        without reason are numerous.
038:020 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,
        because I follow what is good.
038:021 Don't forsake me, Yahweh.  My God, don't be far from me.
038:022 Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
039:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  For Jeduthun.  A Psalm by David.>> I said,
        "I will watch my ways, so that I don't sin with my tongue.
        I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me."
039:002 I was mute with silence.  I held my peace, even from good.
        My sorrow was stirred.
039:003 My heart was hot within me.  While I meditated, the fire burned:
        I spoke with my tongue:
039:004 "Yahweh, show me my end, what is the measure of my days.
        Let me know how frail I am.
039:005 Behold, you have made my days handbreadths.  My lifetime
        is as nothing before you.  Surely every man stands as
        a breath."  Selah.
039:006 "Surely every man walks like a shadow.  Surely they busy themselves
        in vain.  He heaps up, and doesn't know who shall gather.
039:007 Now, Lord, what do I wait for?  My hope is in you.
039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions.  Don't make me the reproach
        of the foolish.
039:009 I was mute.  I didn't open my mouth, because you did it.
039:010 Remove your scourge away from me.  I am overcome by the blow
        of your hand.
039:011 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity, You consume his
        wealth like a moth.  Surely every man is but a breath."  Selah.
039:012 "Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.
        Don't be silent at my tears.  For I am a stranger with you,
        a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
039:013 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go away,
        and exist no more."
040:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> I waited
        patiently for Yahweh.  He turned to me, and heard my cry.
040:002 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay.
        He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.
040:003 He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
        Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.
040:004 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust, and doesn't
        respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
040:005 Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you
        have done, and your thoughts which are toward us.
        They can't be declared back to you.  If I would declare
        and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
040:006 Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire.  You have opened my ears.
        You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.
040:007 Then I said, "Behold, I have come.  It is written about me
        in the book in the scroll.
040:008 I delight to do your will, my God.  Yes, your law is
        within my heart."
040:009 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.
        Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.
040:010 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.
        I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.
        I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth
        from the great assembly.
040:011 Don't withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.  Let your
        loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.
040:012 For innumerable evils have surrounded me.  My iniquities
        have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.
        They are more than the hairs of my head.  My heart has failed me.
040:013 Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.  Hurry to help me, Yahweh.
040:014 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek
        after my soul to destroy it.  Let them be turned backward
        and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.
040:015 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell
        me, "Aha!  Aha!"
040:016 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
        Let such as love your salvation say continually,
        "Let Yahweh be exalted!"
040:017 But I am poor and needy.  May the Lord think about me.
        You are my help and my deliverer.  Don't delay, my God.
041:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Blessed
        is he who considers the poor.  Yahweh will deliver him
        in the day of evil.
041:002 Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive.
        He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender
        him to the will of his enemies.
041:003 Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from
        his bed of illness.
041:004 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me!  Heal me, for I have
        sinned against you."
041:005 My enemies speak evil against me:  "When will he die,
        and his name perish?"
041:006 If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.  His heart gathers
        iniquity to itself.  When he goes abroad, he tells it.
041:007 All who hate me whisper together against me.  They imagine
        the worst for me.
041:008 "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted him.
        Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."
041:009 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread
        with me, has lifted up his heel against me.
041:010 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I
        may repay them.
041:011 By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn't
        triumph over me.
041:012 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in
        your presence forever.
041:013 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and
        to everlasting!  Amen and amen.
042:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A contemplation by the sons of
        Korah.>> As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul
        pants after you, God.
042:002 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.  When shall I
        come and appear before God?
042:003 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually
        ask me, "Where is your God?"
042:004 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
        how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the house
        of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping
        a holy day.
042:005 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him for the saving
        help of his presence.
042:006 My God, my soul is in despair within me.  Therefore I remember
        you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon,
        from the hill Mizar.
042:007 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.
        All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
042:008 Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime.
        In the night his song shall be with me:  a prayer to the God
        of my life.
042:009 I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me?
        Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
042:010 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,
        while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"
042:011 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him, the saving help
        of my countenance, and my God.
043:001 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.
        Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
043:002 For you are the God of my strength.  Why have you rejected me?
        Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
043:003 Oh, send out your light and your truth.  Let them lead me.
        Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.
043:004 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy.
        I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
043:005 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him:  my Savior,
        my helper, and my God.
044:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By the sons of Korah.
        A contemplative psalm.>> We have heard with our ears, God;
        our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days,
        in the days of old.
044:002 You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them.
        You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.
044:003 For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword,
        neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand,
        and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were
        favorable to them.
044:004 You are my King, God.  Command victories for Jacob!
044:005 Through you, will we push down our adversaries.  Through your name,
        will we tread them under who rise up against us.
044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
044:007 But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed
        those who hate us.
044:008 In God we have made our boast all day long, we will give thanks
        to your name forever.  Selah.
044:009 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don't
        go out with our armies.
044:010 You make us turn back from the adversary.  Those who hate us
        take spoil for themselves.
044:011 You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us
        among the nations.
044:012 You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing
        from their sale.
044:013 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision
        to those who are around us.
044:014 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head
        among the peoples.
044:015 All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,
044:016 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,
        because of the enemy and the avenger.
044:017 All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you,
        Neither have we been false to your covenant.
044:018 Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed
        from your path,
044:019 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered
        us with the shadow of death.
044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth
        our hands to a strange god;
044:021 won't God search this out?  For he knows the secrets of the heart.
044:022 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.  We are regarded
        as sheep for the slaughter.
044:023 Wake up!  Why do you sleep, Lord?  Arise!  Don't reject us forever.
044:024 Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction
        and our oppression?
044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust.  Our body cleaves
        to the earth.
044:026 Rise up to help us.  Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake.
045:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  Set to "The Lilies."  A contemplation
        by the sons of Korah.  A wedding song.>> My heart overflows
        with a noble theme.  I recite my verses for the king.
        My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.
045:002 You are the most excellent of the sons of men.  Grace has
        anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.
045:003 Gird your sword on your thigh, mighty one:  your splendor
        and your majesty.
045:004 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility,
        and righteousness.  Let your right hand display awesome deeds.
045:005 Your arrows are sharp.  The nations fall under you, with arrows
        in the heart of the king's enemies.
045:006 Your throne, God, is forever and ever.  A scepter of equity
        is the scepter of your kingdom.
045:007 You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.
        Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil
        of gladness above your fellows.
045:008 All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
        Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
045:009 Kings' daughters are among your honorable women.
        At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.
045:010 Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.  Forget your
        own people, and also your father's house.
045:011 So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.
045:012 The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.  The rich among
        the people entreat your favor.
045:013 The princess inside is all glorious.  Her clothing is
        interwoven with gold.
045:014 She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.  The virgins,
        her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.
045:015 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.  They shall
        enter into the king's palace.
045:016 Your sons will take the place of your fathers.  You shall make
        them princes in all the earth.
045:017 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.
        Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
        {}
046:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By the sons of Korah.
        According to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term.>> God is our
        refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
046:002 Therefore we won't be afraid, though the earth changes,
        though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
046:003 though the waters of it roar and are troubled, though the mountains
        tremble with their swelling.  Selah.
046:004 There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,
        the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
046:005 God is in her midst.  She shall not be moved.  God will help
        her at dawn.
046:006 The nations raged.  The kingdoms were moved.  He lifted his voice,
        and the earth melted.
046:007 Yahweh of Armies is with us.  The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.
046:008 Come, see Yahweh's works, what desolations he has made
        in the earth.
046:009 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.  He breaks the bow,
        and shatters the spear.  He burns the chariots in the fire.
046:010 "Be still, and know that I am God.  I will be exalted among
        the nations.  I will be exalted in the earth."
046:011 Yahweh of Armies is with us.  The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.
047:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>>
        Oh clap your hands, all you nations.  Shout to God with
        the voice of triumph!
047:002 For Yahweh Most High is awesome.  He is a great King over
        all the earth.
047:003 He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.
047:004 He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom
        he loved.  Selah.
047:005 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
047:006 Sing praise to God, sing praises.  Sing praises to our King,
        sing praises.
047:007 For God is the King of all the earth.  Sing praises
        with understanding.
047:008 God reigns over the nations.  God sits on his holy throne.
047:009 The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of
        the God of Abraham.  For the shields of the earth belong to God.
        He is greatly exalted!
048:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Great is Yahweh,
        and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God,
        in his holy mountain.
048:002 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion,
        on the north sides, the city of the great King.
048:003 God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.
048:004 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together.
048:005 They saw it, then they were amazed.  They were dismayed.
        They hurried away.
048:006 Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.
048:007 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
048:008 As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies,
        in the city of our God.  God will establish it forever.  Selah.
048:009 We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the midst
        of your temple.
048:010 As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth.
        Your right hand is full of righteousness.
048:011 Let Mount Zion be glad!  Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,
        Because of your judgments.
048:012 Walk about Zion, and go around her.  Number its towers.
048:013 Mark well her bulwarks.  Consider her palaces, that you may
        tell it to the next generation.
048:014 For this God is our God forever and ever.  He will be our guide
        even to death.
049:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>>
        Hear this, all you peoples.  Listen, all you inhabitants
        of the world,
049:002 both low and high, rich and poor together.
049:003 My mouth will speak words of wisdom.  My heart
        shall utter understanding.
049:004 I will incline my ear to a proverb.  I will open my riddle
        on the harp.
049:005 Why should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my
        heels surrounds me?
049:006 Those who trust in their wealth, and boast in the multitude
        of their riches--
049:007 none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give
        God a ransom for him.
049:008 For the redemption of their life is costly, no payment
        is ever enough,
049:009 That he should live on forever, that he should not see corruption.
049:010 For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the
        senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.
049:011 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,
        and their dwelling places to all generations.  They name
        their lands after themselves.
049:012 But man, despite his riches, doesn't endure.  He is like
        the animals that perish.
049:013 This is the destiny of those who are foolish, and of those
        who approve their sayings.  Selah.
049:014 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.  Death shall
        be their shepherd.  The upright shall have dominion over
        them in the morning.  Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,
        far from their mansion.
049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,
        for he will receive me.  Selah.
049:016 Don't be afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his
        house is increased.
049:017 For when he dies he shall carry nothing away.  His glory shall
        not descend after him.
049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul--and men praise you
        when you do well for yourself--
049:019 he shall go to the generation of his fathers.  They shall
        never see the light.
049:020 A man who has riches without understanding, is like the
        animals that perish.
050:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks,
        and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.
050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
050:003 Our God comes, and does not keep silent.  A fire devours before him.
        It is very stormy around him.
050:004 He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may
        judge his people:
050:005 "Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant
        with me by sacrifice."
050:006 The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself
        is judge.  Selah.
050:007 "Hear, my people, and I will speak; Israel, and I will testify
        against you.  I am God, your God.
050:008 I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices.  Your burnt offerings
        are continually before me.
050:009 I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats
        from your pens.
050:010 For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock
        on a thousand hills.
050:011 I know all the birds of the mountains.  The wild animals
        of the field are mine.
050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine,
        and all that is in it.
050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
050:014 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.  Pay your vows
        to the Most High.
050:015 Call on me in the day of trouble.  I will deliver you,
        and you will honor me."
050:016 But to the wicked God says, "What right do you have to declare
        my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips,
050:017 seeing you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you?
050:018 When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have
        participated with adulterers.
050:019 "You give your mouth to evil.  Your tongue frames deceit.
050:020 You sit and speak against your brother.  You slander your
        own mother's son.
050:021 You have done these things, and I kept silent.
        You thought that the I was just like you.  I will rebuke you,
        and accuse you in front of your eyes.
050:022 "Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces,
        and there be none to deliver.
050:023 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,
        and prepares his way so that I will show God's salvation to him."
051:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David, when Nathan
        the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.>>
        Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.
        According to the multitude of your tender mercies,
        blot out my transgressions.
051:002 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.  Cleanse me from my sin.
051:003 For I know my transgressions.  My sin is constantly before me.
051:004 Against you, and you only, have I sinned, and done that which is
        evil in your sight; that you may be proved right when you speak,
        and justified when you judge.
051:005 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity.  In sin my
        mother conceived me.
051:006 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.  You teach me
        wisdom in the inmost place.
051:007 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.  Wash me, and I
        will be whiter than snow.
051:008 Let me hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have
        broken may rejoice.
051:009 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities.
051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God.  Renew a right spirit within me.
051:011 Don't throw me from your presence, and don't take your holy
        Spirit from me.
051:012 Restore to me the joy of your salvation.  Uphold me with
        a willing spirit.
051:013 Then I will teach transgressors your ways.  Sinners shall
        be converted to you.
051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation.
        My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
051:015 Lord, open my lips.  My mouth shall declare your praise.
051:016 For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
        You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.  A broken and
        contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
051:018 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.  Build the walls of Jerusalem.
051:019 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
        in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
        Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
052:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A contemplation by David, when Doeg
        the Edomite came and told Saul, "David has come to Abimelech's
        house.">> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
        God's loving kindness endures continually.
052:002 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor,
        working deceitfully.
052:003 You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking
        the truth.  Selah.
052:004 You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.
052:005 God will likewise destroy you forever.  He will take you up,
        and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land
        of the living.  Selah.
052:006 The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,
052:007 "Behold, this is the man who didn't make God his strength,
        but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
        himself in his wickedness."
052:008 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house.
        I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever.
052:009 I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.
        I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence
        of your saints.
053:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Mahalath." A contemplation
        by David.>> The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."
        They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.
        There is no one who does good.
053:002 God looks down from heaven on the children of men, to see
        if there are any who understood, who seek after God.
053:003 Every one of them has gone back.  They have become filthy together.
        There is no one who does good, no, not one.
053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people
        as they eat bread, and don't call on God?
053:005 There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God
        has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.
        You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  When God
        brings back his people from captivity, then Jacob shall rejoice,
        and Israel shall be glad.
054:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.  A contemplation
        by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "Isn't David
        hiding himself among us?">> Save me, God, by your name.
        Vindicate me in your might.
054:002 Hear my prayer, God.  Listen to the words of my mouth.
054:003 For strangers have risen up against me.  Violent men have sought
        after my soul.  They haven't set God before them.  Selah.
054:004 Behold, God is my helper.  The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.
054:005 He will repay the evil to my enemies.  Destroy them in your truth.
054:006 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.
        I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.
054:007 For he has delivered me out of all trouble.  My eye has seen
        triumph over my enemies.
055:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.
        A contemplation by David.>> Listen to my prayer, God.
        Don't hide yourself from my supplication.
055:002 Attend to me, and answer me.  I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression
        of the wicked.  For they bring suffering on me.
        In anger they hold a grudge against me.
055:004 My heart is severely pained within me.  The terrors of death
        have fallen on me.
055:005 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.
        Horror has overwhelmed me.
055:006 I said, "Oh that I had wings like a dove!  Then I would fly away,
        and be at rest.
055:007 Behold, then I would wander far off.  I would lodge in
        the wilderness."  Selah.
055:008 "I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm."
055:009 Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, for I have
        seen violence and strife in the city.
055:010 Day and night they prowl around on its walls.  Malice and abuse
        are also within her.
055:011 Destructive forces are within her.  Threats and lies don't
        depart from her streets.
055:012 For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have
        endured it.  Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself
        up against me, then I would have hid myself from him.
055:013 But it was you, a man like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.
055:014 We took sweet fellowship together.  We walked in God's
        house with company.
055:015 Let death come suddenly on them.  Let them go down alive into Sheol.
        For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
055:016 As for me, I will call on God.  Yahweh will save me.
055:017 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.
        He will hear my voice.
055:018 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was
        against me, although there are many who oppose me.
055:019 God, who is enthroned forever, will hear, and answer them.
        Selah.  They never change, who don't fear God.
055:020 He raises his hands against his friends.  He has
        violated his covenant.
055:021 His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war.
        His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
055:022 Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you.
        He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
055:023 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.
        Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,
        but I will trust in you.
056:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Silent Dove in
        Distant Lands."  A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him
        in Gath.>> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.
        All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
056:002 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are
        many who fight proudly against me.
056:003 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.
056:004 In God, I praise his word.  In God, I put my trust.
        I will not be afraid.  What can flesh do to me?
056:005 All day long they twist my words.  All their thoughts are
        against me for evil.
056:006 They conspire and lurk, watching my steps, they are eager
        to take my life.
056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity?  In anger cast down the peoples, God.
056:008 You number my wanderings.  You put my tears into your bottle.
        Aren't they in your book?
056:009 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.
        I know this, that God is for me.
056:010 In God, I will praise his word.  In Yahweh, I will praise his word.
056:011 I have put my trust in God.  I will not be afraid.
        What can man do to me?
056:012 Your vows are on me, God.  I will give thank offerings to you.
056:013 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my
        feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
        of the living.
057:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.>> Be
        merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge
        in you.  Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,
        until disaster has passed.
057:002 I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my
        requests for me.
057:003 He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one
        who is pursuing me.  Selah.  God will send out his loving
        kindness and his truth.
057:004 My soul is among lions.  I lie among those who are set on fire,
        even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
        and their tongue a sharp sword.
057:005 Be exalted, God, above the heavens!  Let your glory be above
        all the earth!
057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps.  My soul is bowed down.
        They dig a pit before me.  They fall into the midst of
        it themselves.  Selah.
057:007 My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast.
        I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
057:008 Wake up, my glory!  Wake up, psaltery and harp!
        I will wake up the dawn.
057:009 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples.
        I will sing praises to you among the nations.
057:010 For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens,
        and your truth to the skies.
057:011 Be exalted, God, above the heavens.  Let your glory be over
        all the earth.
058:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David.>> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?
        Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?
058:002 No, in your heart you plot injustice.  You measure out the violence
        of your hands in the earth.
058:003 The wicked go astray from the womb.  They are wayward as soon
        as they are born, speaking lies.
058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like a deaf cobra
        that stops its ear,
058:005 which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, no matter
        how skillful the charmer may be.
058:006 Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.  Break out the great
        teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
058:007 Let them vanish as water that flows away.  When they draw the bow,
        let their arrows be made blunt.
058:008 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,
        like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
058:009 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep
        away the green and the burning alike.
058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.
        He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
058:011 so that men shall say, "Most certainly there is a reward
        for the righteous.  Most certainly there is a God who
        judges the earth."
059:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house
        to kill him.>> Deliver me from my enemies, my God.
        Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.  Save me from
        the bloodthirsty men.
059:003 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.  The mighty gather
        themselves together against me, not for my disobedience,
        nor for my sin, Yahweh.
059:004 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
        Rise up, behold, and help me!
059:005 You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish
        the nations.  Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.  Selah.
059:006 They return at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl
        around the city.
059:007 Behold, they spew with their mouth.  Swords are in their lips, "For,"
        they say, "who hears us?"
059:008 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.  You scoff at all the nations.
059:009 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower.
059:010 My God will go before me with his loving kindness.
        God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.
059:011 Don't kill them, or my people may forget.  Scatter them
        by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.
059:012 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
        let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies
        which they utter.
059:013 Consume them in wrath.  Consume them, and they will be no more.
        Let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of
        the earth.  Selah.
059:014 At evening let them return.  Let them howl like a dog,
        and go around the city.
059:015 They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night
        if they aren't satisfied.
059:016 But I will sing of your strength.  Yes, I will sing aloud
        of your loving kindness in the morning.  For you have been
        my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress.
059:017 To you, my strength, I will sing praises.  For God is my high tower,
        the God of my mercy.
060:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant."
        A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim
        and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve
        thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.>> God, you have
        rejected us.  You have broken us down.  You have been angry.
        Restore us, again.
060:002 You have made the land tremble.  You have torn it.
        Mend its fractures, for it quakes.
060:003 You have shown your people hard things.  You have made us
        drink the wine that makes us stagger.
060:004 You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be
        displayed because of the truth.  Selah.
060:005 So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand,
        and answer us.
060:006 God has spoken from his sanctuary:  "I will triumph.
        I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.  Ephraim also is the defense
        of my head.  Judah is my scepter.
060:008 Moab is my wash basin.  I will throw my shoe on Edom.
        I shout in triumph over Philistia."
060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city?  Who has led me to Edom?
060:010 Haven't you, God, rejected us?  You don't go out with
        our armies, God.
060:011 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain.
060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is he who will tread
        down our adversaries.
061:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  For a stringed instrument.
        By David.>> Hear my cry, God.  Listen to my prayer.
061:002 From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my heart
        is overwhelmed.  Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
061:003 For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
061:004 I will dwell in your tent forever.  I will take refuge
        in the shelter of your wings.  Selah.
061:005 For you, God, have heard my vows.  You have given me the heritage
        of those who fear your name.
061:006 You will prolong the king's life; his years shall be for generations.
061:007 He shall be enthroned in God's presence forever.  Appoint your
        loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
061:008 So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill
        my vows daily.
062:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthan.  A Psalm by David.>>
        My soul rests in God alone.  My salvation is from him.
062:002 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress--I will
        never be greatly shaken.
062:003 How long will you assault a man, would all of you throw him down,
        Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
062:004 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.
        They delight in lies.  They bless with their mouth, but they
        curse inwardly.  Selah.
062:005 My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation
        is from him.
062:006 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.
        I will not be shaken.
062:007 With God is my salvation and my honor.  The rock of my strength,
        and my refuge, is in God.
062:008 Trust in him at all times, you people.  Pour out your heart
        before him.  God is a refuge for us.  Selah.
062:009 Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high
        degree are a lie.  In the balances they will go up.
        They are together lighter than a breath.
062:010 Don't trust in oppression.  Don't become vain in robbery.
        If riches increase, don't set your heart on them.
062:011 God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power
        belongs to God.
062:012 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, for you reward
        every man according to his work.
063:001 <<A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah.>> God,
        you are my God.  I will earnestly seek you.  My soul thirsts
        for you.  My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land,
        where there is no water.
063:002 So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power
        and your glory.
063:003 Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips
        shall praise you.
063:004 So I will bless you while I live.  I will lift up my hands
        in your name.
063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.
        My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
063:006 when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in
        the night watches.
063:007 For you have been my help.  I will rejoice in the shadow
        of your wings.
063:008 My soul stays close to you.  Your right hand holds me up.
063:009 But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into
        the lower parts of the earth.
063:010 They shall be given over to the power of the sword.
        They shall be jackal food.
063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God.  Everyone who swears by him
        will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies
        shall be silenced.
064:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Hear my voice,
        God, in my complaint.  Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
064:002 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy
        crowd of the ones doing evil;
064:003 who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows,
        deadly words,
064:004 to shoot innocent men from ambushes.  They shoot at him
        suddenly and fearlessly.
064:005 They encourage themselves in evil plans.  They talk about laying
        snares secretly.  They say, "Who will see them?"
064:006 They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!"
        Surely man's mind and heart are cunning.
064:007 But God will shoot at them.  They will be suddenly struck
        down with an arrow.
064:008 Their own tongues shall ruin them.  All who see them will
        shake their heads.
064:009 All mankind shall be afraid.  They shall declare the work of God,
        and shall wisely ponder what he has done.
064:010 The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him.
        All the upright in heart shall praise him!
065:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.  A song.>> Praise
        waits for you, God, in Zion.  To you shall vows be performed.
065:002 You who hear prayer, to you all men will come.
065:003 Sins overwhelmed me, but you atoned for our transgressions.
065:004 Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause to come near,
        that he may live in your courts.  We will be filled with
        the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
065:005 By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, God of
        our salvation.  You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,
        of those who are far away on the sea;
065:006 Who by his power forms the mountains, having armed
        yourself with strength;
065:007 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves,
        and the turmoil of the nations.
065:008 They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your wonders.
        You call the morning's dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
065:009 You visit the earth, and water it.  You greatly enrich it.
        The river of God is full of water.  You provide them grain,
        for so you have ordained it.
065:010 You drench its furrows.  You level its ridges.  You soften it
        with showers.  You bless it with a crop.
065:011 You crown the year with your bounty.  Your carts
        overflow with abundance.
065:012 The wilderness grasslands overflow.  The hills are
        clothed with gladness.
065:013 The pastures are covered with flocks.  The valleys also are
        clothed with grain.  They shout for joy!  They also sing.
066:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A song.  A Psalm.>> Make a joyful
        shout to God, all the earth!
066:002 Sing to the glory of his name!  Offer glory and praise!
066:003 Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds!  Through the greatness
        of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.
066:004 All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you;
        they will sing to your name."  Selah.
066:005 Come, and see God's deeds--awesome work on behalf of the
        children of men.
066:006 He turned the sea into dry land.  They went through the river
        on foot.  There, we rejoiced in him.
066:007 He rules by his might forever.  His eyes watch the nations.
        Don't let the rebellious rise up against him.  Selah.
066:008 Praise our God, you peoples!  Make the sound of his praise heard,
066:009 who preserves our life among the living, and doesn't allow
        our feet to be moved.
066:010 For you, God, have tested us.  You have refined us,
        as silver is refined.
066:011 You brought us into prison.  You laid a burden on our backs.
066:012 You allowed men to ride over our heads.  We went through fire
        and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance.
066:013 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.
        I will pay my vows to you,
066:014 which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
066:015 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the
        offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats.  Selah.
066:016 Come, and hear, all you who fear God.  I will declare what he has
        done for my soul.
066:017 I cried to him with my mouth.  He was extolled with my tongue.
066:018 If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord wouldn't have listened.
066:019 But most certainly, God has listened.  He has heard the voice
        of my prayer.
066:020 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his
        loving kindness from me.
067:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  With stringed instruments.
        A Psalm.  A song.>> May God be merciful to us, bless us,
        and cause his face to shine on us.  Selah.
067:002 That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation
        among all nations,
067:003 let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:004 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge
        the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth.  Selah.
067:005 Let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:006 The earth has yielded its increase.  God, even our own God,
        will bless us.
067:007 God will bless us.  All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
068:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.
        A song.>> Let God arise!  Let his enemies be scattered!
        Let them who hate him also flee before him.
068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.  As wax melts before
        the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
068:003 But let the righteous be glad.  Let them rejoice before God.
        Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
068:004 Sing to God!  Sing praises to his name!  Extol him who rides
        on the clouds:  to Yah, his name!  Rejoice before him!
068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,
        is God in his holy habitation.
068:006 God sets the lonely in families.  He brings out the prisoners
        with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
068:007 God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched
        through the wilderness... Selah.
068:008 The earth trembled.  The sky also poured down rain at
        the presence of the God of Sinai--at the presence of God,
        the God of Israel.
068:009 You, God, sent a plentiful rain.  You confirmed your inheritance,
        when it was weary.
068:010 Your congregation lived therein.  You, God, prepared your
        goodness for the poor.
068:011 The Lord announced the word.  The ones who proclaim it are
        a great company.
068:012 "Kings of armies flee!  They flee!"  She who waits at home
        divides the spoil,
068:013 while you sleep among the campfires, the wings of a dove
        sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining gold.
068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in her, it snowed on Zalmon.
068:015 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.
        The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
068:016 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain
        where God chooses to reign?  Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.
068:017 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.
        The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.
068:018 You have ascended on high.  You have led away captives.
        You have received gifts among men, yes, among the rebellious also,
        that Yah God might dwell there.
068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, even the God
        who is our salvation.  Selah.
068:020 God is to us a God of deliverance.  To Yahweh, the Lord,
        belongs escape from death.
068:021 But God will strike through the head of his enemies, the hairy
        scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.
068:022 The Lord said, "I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring
        you again from the depths of the sea;
068:023 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,
        that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion
        from your enemies."
068:024 They have seen your processions, God, even the processions
        of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
068:025 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
        in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines,
068:026 "Bless God in the congregations, even the Lord in the
        assembly of Israel!"
068:027 There is little Benjamin, their ruler, the princes of Judah,
        their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
068:028 Your God has commanded your strength.  Strengthen, God, that which
        you have done for us.
068:029 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, kings shall bring
        presents to you.
068:030 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls,
        with the calves of the peoples.  Being humbled, may it bring
        bars of silver.  Scatter the nations that delight in war.
068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt.  Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch
        out her hands to God.
068:032 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!  Sing praises to
        the Lord!  Selah.
068:033 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;
        behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
068:034 Ascribe strength to God!  His excellency is over Israel,
        his strength is in the skies.
068:035 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.
        The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.
        Praise be to God!
069:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Lilies." By David.>>
        Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!
069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.
        I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
069:003 I am weary with my crying.  My throat is dry.  My eyes fail,
        looking for my God.
069:004 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.
        Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully,
        are mighty.  I have to restore what I didn't take away.
069:005 God, you know my foolishness.  My sins aren't hidden from you.
069:006 Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me,
        Lord Yahweh of Armies.  Don't let those who seek you be brought
        to dishonor through me, God of Israel.
069:007 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.  Shame has
        covered my face.
069:008 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to
        my mother's children.
069:009 For the zeal of your house consumes me.  The reproaches
        of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
069:010 When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.
069:011 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
069:012 Those who sit in the gate talk about me.  I am the song
        of the drunkards.
069:013 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time.
        God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me
        in the truth of your salvation.
069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink.
        Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of
        the deep waters.
069:015 Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep
        swallow me up.  Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.
069:016 Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.
        According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
069:017 Don't hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress.
        Answer me speedily!
069:018 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.  Ransom me because
        of my enemies.
069:019 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.
        My adversaries are all before you.
069:020 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.
        I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
        for comforters, but I found none.
069:021 They also gave me gall for my food.  In my thirst, they gave
        me vinegar to drink.
069:022 Let their table before them become a snare.  May it become
        a retribution and a trap.
069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see.
        Let their backs be continually bent.
069:024 Pour out your indignation on them.  Let the fierceness of your
        anger overtake them.
069:025 Let their habitation be desolate.  Let no one dwell in their tents.
069:026 For they persecute him whom you have wounded.  They tell
        of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
069:027 Charge them with crime upon crime.  Don't let them come
        into your righteousness.
069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written
        with the righteous.
069:029 But I am in pain and distress.  Let your salvation, God, protect me.
069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
        him with thanksgiving.
069:031 It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has
        horns and hoofs.
069:032 The humble have seen it, and are glad.  You who seek after God,
        let your heart live.
069:033 For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn't despise his captive people.
069:034 Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything
        that moves therein!
069:035 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.
        They shall settle there, and own it.
069:036 The children also of his servants shall inherit it.
        Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
070:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.  A reminder.>> Hurry, God,
        to deliver me.  Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.
070:002 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.
        Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
070:003 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, "Aha!  Aha!"
070:004 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
        Let those who love your salvation continually say,
        "Let God be exalted!"
070:005 But I am poor and needy.  Come to me quickly, God.  You are
        my help and my deliverer.  Yahweh, don't delay.
071:001 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.  Never let me be disappointed.
071:002 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.
        Turn your ear to me, and save me.
071:003 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.
        Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
071:004 Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand
        of the unrighteous and cruel man.
071:005 For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh; my confidence from my youth.
071:006 I have relied on you from the womb.  You are he who took me
        out of my mother's womb.  I will always praise you.
071:007 I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.
071:008 My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor
        all the day.
071:009 Don't reject me in my old age.  Don't forsake me when
        my strength fails.
071:010 For my enemies talk about me.  Those who watch for my
        soul conspire together,
071:011 saying, "God has forsaken him.  Pursue and take him, for no
        one will rescue him."
071:012 God, don't be far from me.  My God, hurry to help me.
071:013 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.  Let them be
        covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
071:014 But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.
071:015 My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your
        salvation all day, though I don't know its full measure.
071:016 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.
        I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
071:017 God, you have taught me from my youth.  Until now, I have
        declared your wondrous works.
071:018 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don't forsake me,
        until I have declared your strength to the next generation,
        your might to everyone who is to come.
071:019 Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;
        you have done great things.  God, who is like you?
071:020 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will
        let me live.  You will bring us up again from the depths
        of the earth.
071:021 Increase my honor, and comfort me again.
071:022 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.
        I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
071:023 My lips shall shout for joy!  My soul, which you have redeemed,
        sings praises to you!
071:024 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,
        for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want
        to harm me.
072:001 <<By Solomon.>> God, give the king your justice; your righteousness
        to the royal son.
072:002 He will judge your people with righteousness, and your
        poor with justice.
072:003 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.
        The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
072:004 He will judge the poor of the people.  He will save the children
        of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.
072:005 They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon,
        throughout all generations.
072:006 He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers
        that water the earth.
072:007 In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace,
        until the moon is no more.
072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River
        to the ends of the earth.
072:009 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.
        His enemies shall lick the dust.
072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.
        The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
072:011 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.  All nations
        shall serve him.
072:012 For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor,
        who has no helper.
072:013 He will have pity on the poor and needy.  He will save the souls
        of the needy.
072:014 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.
        Their blood will be precious in his sight.
072:015 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.
        Men shall pray for him continually.  They shall bless him
        all day long.
072:016 There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land.
        Its fruit sways like Lebanon.  Let it flourish, thriving like
        the grass of the field.
072:017 His name endures forever.  His name continues as long as the sun.
        Men shall be blessed by him.  All nations will call him blessed.
072:018 Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone
        does marvelous deeds.
072:019 Blessed be his glorious name forever!  Let the whole earth
        be filled with his glory!  Amen and amen.
072:020 This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
073:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> Surely God is good to Israel, to those
        who are pure in heart.
073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone.  My steps
        had nearly slipped.
073:003 For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity
        of the wicked.
073:004 For there are no struggles in their death, but their
        strength is firm.
073:005 They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued
        like other men.
073:006 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.
        Violence covers them like a garment.
073:007 Their eyes bulge with fat.  Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
073:008 They scoff and speak with malice.  In arrogance,
        they threaten oppression.
073:009 They have set their mouth in the heavens.  Their tongue walks
        through the earth.
073:010 Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up
        waters of abundance.
073:011 They say, "How does God know?  Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
073:012 Behold, these are the wicked.  Being always at ease,
        they increase in riches.
073:013 Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my
        hands in innocence,
073:014 For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.
073:015 If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed
        the generation of your children.
073:016 When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;
073:017 Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.
073:018 Surely you set them in slippery places.  You throw them
        down to destruction.
073:019 How they are suddenly destroyed!  They are completely swept
        away with terrors.
073:020 As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake,
        you will despise their fantasies.
073:021 For my soul was grieved.  I was embittered in my heart.
073:022 I was so senseless and ignorant.  I was a brute beast before you.
073:023 Nevertheless, I am continually with you.  You have held
        my right hand.
073:024 You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive
        me to glory.
073:025 Who do I have in heaven?  There is no one on earth who I
        desire besides you.
073:026 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart
        and my portion forever.
073:027 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.
        You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
073:028 But it is good for me to come close to God.  I have made
        the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
074:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> God, why have you rejected us forever?
        Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
074:002 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,
        which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;
        Mount Zion, in which you have lived.
074:003 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that
        the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
074:004 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly.
        They have set up their standards as signs.
074:005 They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a
        thicket of trees.
074:006 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
074:007 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.
        They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
074:008 They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely."
        They have burned up all the places in the land where
        God was worshiped.
074:009 We see no miraculous signs.  There is no longer any prophet,
        neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
074:010 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?  Shall the enemy
        blaspheme your name forever?
074:011 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?
        Take it out of your pocket and consume them!
074:012 Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst
        of the earth.
074:013 You divided the sea by your strength.  You broke the heads
        of the sea monsters in the waters.
074:014 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.  You gave him
        as food to people and desert creatures.
074:015 You opened up spring and stream.  You dried up mighty rivers.
074:016 The day is yours, the night is also yours.  You have prepared
        the light and the sun.
074:017 You have set all the boundaries of the earth.  You have made
        summer and winter.
074:018 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.
        Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
074:019 Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.
        Don't forget the life of your poor forever.
074:020 Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark
        places of the earth.
074:021 Don't let the oppressed return ashamed.  Let the poor and needy
        praise your name.
074:022 Arise, God!  Plead your own cause.  Remember how the foolish
        man mocks you all day.
074:023 Don't forget the voice of your adversaries.  The tumult
        of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
075:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> We give thanks to you, God.
        We give thanks, for your Name is near.  Men tell about
        your wondrous works.
075:002 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
075:003 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.  I firmly hold
        its pillars.  Selah.
075:004 I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"  I said to the wicked,
        "Don't lift up the horn.
075:005 Don't lift up your horn on high.  Don't speak with a stiff neck."
075:006 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from
        the south, comes exaltation.
075:007 But God is the judge.  He puts down one, and lifts up another.
075:008 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming
        wine mixed with spices.  He pours it out.  Indeed the wicked
        of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
075:009 But I will declare this forever:  I will sing praises to
        the God of Jacob.
075:010 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns
        of the righteous shall be lifted up.
076:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.
        A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> In Judah, God is known.
        His name is great in Israel.
076:002 His tent is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.
076:003 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield,
        and the sword, and the weapons of war.  Selah.
076:004 Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.
076:005 Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep.
        None of the men of war can lift their hands.
076:006 At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast
        into a deep sleep.
076:007 You, even you, are to be feared.  Who can stand in your sight
        when you are angry?
076:008 You pronounced judgment from heaven.  The earth feared,
        and was silent,
076:009 when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones
        of the earth.  Selah.
076:010 Surely the wrath of man praises you.  The survivors of your
        wrath are restrained.
076:011 Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!  Let all of his
        neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.
076:012 He will cut off the spirit of princes.  He is feared by the kings
        of the earth.
077:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthun.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> My
        cry goes to God!  Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him
        to listen to me.
077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.  My hand
        was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired.
        My soul refused to be comforted.
077:003 I remember God, and I groan.  I complain, and my spirit
        is overwhelmed.  Selah.
077:004 You hold my eyelids open.  I am so troubled that I can't speak.
077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
077:006 I remember my song in the night.  I consider in my own heart;
        my spirit diligently inquires:
077:007 "Will the Lord reject us forever?  Will he be favorable no more?
077:008 Has his loving kindness vanished forever?  Does his promise
        fail for generations?
077:009 Has God forgotten to be gracious?  Has he, in anger,
        withheld his compassion?"  Selah.
077:010 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this:  the years of the right
        hand of the Most High."
077:011 I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your
        wonders of old.
077:012 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.
077:013 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.  What god is great like God?
077:014 You are the God who does wonders.  You have made your strength
        known among the peoples.
077:015 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob
        and Joseph.  Selah.
077:016 The waters saw you, God.  The waters saw you, and they writhed.
        The depths also convulsed.
077:017 The clouds poured out water.  The skies resounded with thunder.
        Your arrows also flashed around.
077:018 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.  The lightnings
        lit up the world.  The earth trembled and shook.
077:019 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters.
        Your footsteps were not known.
077:020 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
078:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> Hear my teaching, my people.
        Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark
        sayings of old,
078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
078:004 We will not hide them from their children, telling to
        the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength,
        and his wondrous works that he has done.
078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed
        a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers,
        that they should make them known to their children;
078:006 that the generation to come might know, even the children
        who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
078:007 that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
        of God, but keep his commandments,
078:008 and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
        generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal,
        whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
        turned back in the day of battle.
078:010 They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.
078:011 They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.
078:012 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,
        in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
078:013 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.
        He made the waters stand as a heap.
078:014 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night
        with a light of fire.
078:015 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly
        as out of the depths.
078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters
        to run down like rivers.
078:017 Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against
        the Most High in the desert.
078:018 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according
        to their desire.
078:019 Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, "Can God prepare
        a table in the wilderness?
078:020 Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,
        and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also?
        Will he provide flesh for his people?"
078:021 Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled
        against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,
078:022 because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust
        in his salvation.
078:023 Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
078:024 He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food
        from the sky.
078:025 Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.
078:026 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power
        he guided the south wind.
078:027 He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds
        as the sand of the seas.
078:028 He let them fall in the midst of their camp,
        around their habitations.
078:029 So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.
078:030 They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet
        in their mouths,
078:031 when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of
        the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.
078:032 For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in
        his wondrous works.
078:033 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their
        years in terror.
078:034 When he killed them, then they inquired after him.
        They returned and sought God earnestly.
078:035 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God,
        their redeemer.
078:036 But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him
        with their tongue.
078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
        faithful in his covenant.
078:038 But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them.
        Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up
        all his wrath.
078:039 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away,
        and doesn't come again.
078:040 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
        and grieved him in the desert!
078:041 They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the
        Holy One of Israel.
078:042 They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed
        them from the adversary;
078:043 how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,
078:044 he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams,
        so that they could not drink.
078:045 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
        and frogs, which destroyed them.
078:046 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor
        to the locust.
078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig
        trees with frost.
078:048 He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks
        to hot thunderbolts.
078:049 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation,
        and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
078:050 He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul
        from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
078:051 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their
        strength in the tents of Ham.
078:052 But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them
        in the wilderness like a flock.
078:053 He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea
        overwhelmed their enemies.
078:054 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain,
        which his right hand had taken.
078:055 He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them
        for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel
        to dwell in their tents.
078:056 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
        and didn't keep his testimonies;
078:057 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.
        They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
        and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
078:059 When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
078:060 So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he
        placed among men;
078:061 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into
        the adversary's hand.
078:062 He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry
        with his inheritance.
078:063 Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.
078:064 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
078:065 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man
        who shouts by reason of wine.
078:066 He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to
        a perpetual reproach.
078:067 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose
        the tribe of Ephraim,
078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.
078:069 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth
        which he has established forever.
078:070 He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
078:071 from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be
        the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.
078:072 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
        and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
079:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into
        your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple.
        They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
079:002 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food
        for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals
        of the earth.
079:003 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.
        There was no one to bury them.
079:004 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and
        derision to those who are around us.
079:005 How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy
        burn like fire?
079:006 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you;
        on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;
079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.
079:008 Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.
        Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are
        in desperate need.
079:009 Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.
        Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
079:010 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"  Let it
        be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance
        for your servants' blood is being poured out.
079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.
        According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who
        are sentenced to death.
079:012 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their
        reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
079:013 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you
        thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.
080:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lilies of
        the Covenant."  A Psalm by Asaph.>> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
        you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above
        the cherubim, shine forth.
080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might!
        Come to save us!
080:003 Turn us again, God.  Cause your face to shine, and we
        will be saved.
080:004 Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against
        the prayer of your people?
080:005 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them
        tears to drink in large measure.
080:006 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.
        Our enemies laugh among themselves.
080:007 Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,
        and we will be saved.
080:008 You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations,
        and planted it.
080:009 You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root,
        and filled the land.
080:010 The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were
        like God's cedars.
080:011 It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
080:012 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass
        by the way pluck it?
080:013 The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals
        of the field feed on it.
080:014 Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven,
        and see, and visit this vine,
080:015 the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you
        made strong for yourself.
080:016 It's burned with fire.  It's cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.
080:017 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son
        of man whom you made strong for yourself.
080:018 So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call
        on your name.
080:019 Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,
        and we will be saved.
081:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.
        By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength!  Make a joyful
        shout to the God of Jacob!
081:002 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre
        with the harp.
081:003 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon,
        on our feast day.
081:004 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
081:005 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over
        the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.
081:006 "I removed his shoulder from the burden.  His hands were freed
        from the basket.
081:007 You called in trouble, and I delivered you.  I answered you
        in the secret place of thunder.  I tested you at the waters
        of Meribah."  Selah.
081:008 "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you
        would listen to me!
081:009 There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship
        any foreign god.
081:010 I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
        Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
081:011 But my people didn't listen to my voice.  Israel desired
        none of me.
081:012 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,
        that they might walk in their own counsels.
081:013 Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk
        in my ways!
081:014 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand
        against their adversaries.
081:015 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment
        would last forever.
081:016 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.
        I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."
082:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly.
        He judges among the gods.
082:002 "How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality
        to the wicked?"  Selah.
082:003 "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.
        Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
082:004 Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand
        of the wicked."
082:005 They don't know, neither do they understand.
        They walk back and forth in darkness.  All the foundations
        of the earth are shaken.
082:006 I said, "You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.
082:007 Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one
        of the rulers."
082:008 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
083:001 <<A song.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent.
        Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.
083:002 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.  Those who hate you
        have lifted up their heads.
083:003 They conspire with cunning against your people.
        They plot against your cherished ones.
083:004 "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation,
        that the name of Israel may be remembered no more."
083:005 For they have conspired together with one mind.
        They form an alliance against you.
083:006 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
083:007 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
083:008 Assyria also is joined with them.  They have helped the children
        of Lot.  Selah.
083:009 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
        at the river Kishon;
083:010 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes
        like Zebah and Zalmunna;
083:012 who said, "Let us take possession of God's pasturelands."
083:013 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
083:014 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets
        the mountains on fire,
083:015 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
083:016 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek
        your name, Yahweh.
083:017 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.  Yes, let them
        be confounded and perish;
083:018 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,
        are the Most High over all the earth.
084:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.
        A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> How lovely are your dwellings,
        Yahweh of Armies!
084:002 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.
        My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
084:003 Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest
        for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars,
        Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.
084:004 Blessed are those who dwell in your house.  They are always
        praising you.  Selah.
084:005 Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set
        their hearts on a pilgrimage.
084:006 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place
        of springs.  Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
084:007 They go from strength to strength.  Everyone of them appears
        before God in Zion.
084:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.  Listen, God of Jacob.  Selah.
084:009 Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
084:010 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.
        I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
        than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
084:011 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.  Yahweh will give
        grace and glory.  He withholds no good thing from those
        who walk blamelessly.
084:012 Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
085:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Yahweh,
        you have been favorable to your land.  You have restored
        the fortunes of Jacob.
085:002 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.  You have covered
        all their sin.  Selah.
085:003 You have taken away all your wrath.  You have turned from
        the fierceness of your anger.
085:004 Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation
        toward us to cease.
085:005 Will you be angry with us forever?  Will you draw out your anger
        to all generations?
085:006 Won't you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
085:007 Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh.  Grant us your salvation.
085:008 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak
        peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn
        again to folly.
085:009 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory
        may dwell in our land.
085:010 Mercy and truth meet together.  Righteousness and peace have
        kissed each other.
085:011 Truth springs out of the earth.  Righteousness has looked
        down from heaven.
085:012 Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good.  Our land will
        yield its increase.
085:013 Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.
086:001 <<A Prayer by David.>> Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am
        poor and needy.
086:002 Preserve my soul, for I am godly.  You, my God, save your
        servant who trusts in you.
086:003 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
086:004 Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I
        lift up my soul.
086:005 For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving
        kindness to all those who call on you.
086:006 Hear, Yahweh, my prayer.  Listen to the voice of my petitions.
086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you
        will answer me.
086:008 There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds
        like your deeds.
086:009 All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.
        They shall glorify your name.
086:010 For you are great, and do wondrous things.  You are God alone.
086:011 Teach me your way, Yahweh.  I will walk in your truth.
        Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
086:012 I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.
        I will glorify your name forevermore.
086:013 For your loving kindness is great toward me.  You have delivered
        my soul from the lowest Sheol.
086:014 God, the proud have risen up against me.  A company of violent
        men have sought after my soul, and they don't hold regard
        for you before them.
086:015 But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger,
        and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
086:016 Turn to me, and have mercy on me!  Give your strength to
        your servant.  Save the son of your handmaid.
086:017 Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may
        see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me,
        and comforted me.
087:001 <<A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.>> His foundation
        is in the holy mountains.
087:002 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
087:003 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.  Selah.
087:004 I will record Rahab{Rahab is a reference to Egypt.} and Babylon
        among those who acknowledge me.  Behold, Philistia, Tyre,
        and also Ethiopia:  "This one was born there."
087:005 Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one was born
        in her;" the Most High himself will establish her.
087:006 Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, "This one
        was born there."  Selah.
087:007 Those who sing as well as those who dance say, "All my springs
        are in you."
088:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.  For the Chief Musician.
        To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction."  A contemplation
        by Heman, the Ezrahite.>> Yahweh, the God of my salvation,
        I have cried day and night before you.
088:002 Let my prayer enter into your presence.  Turn your ear to my cry.
088:003 For my soul is full of troubles.  My life draws near to Sheol.
088:004 I am counted among those who go down into the pit.
        I am like a man who has no help,
088:005 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,
        whom you remember no more.  They are cut off from your hand.
088:006 You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
088:007 Your wrath lies heavily on me.  You have afflicted me with all
        your waves.  Selah.
088:008 You have taken my friends from me.  You have made me an abomination
        to them.  I am confined, and I can't escape.
088:009 My eyes are dim from grief.  I have called on you daily, Yahweh.
        I have spread out my hands to you.
088:010 Do you show wonders to the dead?  Do the dead rise up and
        praise you?  Selah.
088:011 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?
        Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
088:012 Are your wonders made known in the dark?  Or your righteousness
        in the land of forgetfulness?
088:013 But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.  In the morning, my prayer
        comes before you.
088:014 Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?  Why do you hide your
        face from me?
088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.
        While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
088:016 Your fierce wrath has gone over me.  Your terrors have cut me off.
088:017 They came around me like water all day long.
        They completely engulfed me.
088:018 You have put lover and friend far from me, and my
        friends into darkness.
089:001 <<A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.>> I will sing
        of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever.  With my mouth,
        I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
089:002 I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.  You established
        the heavens.  Your faithfulness is in them."
089:003 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn
        to David, my servant,
089:004 'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne
        to all generations.'"  Selah.
089:005 The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness
        also in the assembly of the holy ones.
089:006 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?  Who among
        the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,
089:007 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared
        above all those who are around him?
089:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?
        Yah, your faithfulness is around you.
089:009 You rule the pride of the sea.  When its waves rise up,
        you calm them.
089:010 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.
        You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
089:011 The heavens are yours.  The earth also is yours; the world
        and its fullness.  You have founded them.
089:012 The north and the south, you have created them.
        Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
089:013 You have a mighty arm.  Your hand is strong, and your right
        hand is exalted.
089:014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.
        Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
089:015 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.
        They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.
089:016 In your name they rejoice all day.  In your righteousness,
        they are exalted.
089:017 For you are the glory of their strength.  In your favor,
        our horn will be exalted.
089:018 For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our king to the Holy One of Israel.
089:019 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, "I have
        bestowed strength on the warrior.  I have exalted a young
        man from the people.
089:020 I have found David, my servant.  I have anointed him with
        my holy oil,
089:021 with whom my hand shall be established.  My arm will
        also strengthen him.
089:022 No enemy will tax him.  No wicked man will oppress him.
089:023 I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike
        those who hate him.
089:024 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.
        In my name, his horn will be exalted.
089:025 I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand
        on the rivers.
089:026 He will call to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock
        of my salvation!'
089:027 I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings
        of the earth.
089:028 I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore.
        My covenant will stand firm with him.
089:029 I will also make his seed endure forever, and his throne
        as the days of heaven.
089:030 If his children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances;
089:031 if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments;
089:032 then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their
        iniquity with stripes.
089:033 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,
        nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
089:034 I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.
089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David.
089:036 His seed will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.
089:037 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful
        witness in the sky."  Selah.
089:038 But you have rejected and spurned.  You have been angry
        with your anointed.
089:039 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.
        You have defiled his crown in the dust.
089:040 You have broken down all his hedges.  You have brought his
        strongholds to ruin.
089:041 All who pass by the way rob him.  He has become a reproach
        to his neighbors.
089:042 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.
        You have made all of his enemies rejoice.
089:043 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven't supported
        him in battle.
089:044 You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down
        to the ground.
089:045 You have shortened the days of his youth.  You have covered
        him with shame.  Selah.
089:046 How long, Yahweh?  Will you hide yourself forever?
        Will your wrath burn like fire?
089:047 Remember how short my time is!  For what vanity have you
        created all the children of men!
089:048 What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall
        deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?  Selah.
089:049 Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore
        to David in your faithfulness?
089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear
        in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
089:051 With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they
        have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
089:052 Blessed be Yahweh forevermore.  Amen, and Amen.
090:001 <<A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.>> Lord, you have been
        our dwelling place for all generations.
090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, before you had formed
        the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
        you are God.
090:003 You turn man to destruction, saying, "Return, you children of men."
090:004 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday
        when it is past, like a watch in the night.
090:005 You sweep them away as they sleep.  In the morning they sprout
        like new grass.
090:006 In the morning it sprouts and springs up.  By evening,
        it is withered and dry.
090:007 For we are consumed in your anger.  We are troubled in your wrath.
090:008 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins
        in the light of your presence.
090:009 For all our days have passed away in your wrath.
        We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
090:010 The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength
        eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,
        for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
090:011 Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according
        to the fear that is due to you?
090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
090:013 Relent, Yahweh!  How long?  Have compassion on your servants!
090:014 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we
        may rejoice and be glad all our days.
090:015 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
        for as many years as we have seen evil.
090:016 Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.
090:017 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish the work
        of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.
091:001 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest
        in the shadow of the Almighty.
091:002 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress;
        my God, in whom I trust."
091:003 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,
        and from the deadly pestilence.
091:004 He will cover you with his feathers.  Under his wings you will
        take refuge.  His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
091:005 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow
        that flies by day;
091:006 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction
        that wastes at noonday.
091:007 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your
        right hand; but it will not come near you.
091:008 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense
        of the wicked.
091:009 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High
        your dwelling place,
091:010 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come
        near your dwelling.
091:011 For he will give his angels charge over you, to guard you
        in all your ways.
091:012 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash
        your foot against a stone.
091:013 You will tread on the lion and cobra.  You will trample
        the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
091:014 "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.
        I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
091:015 He will call on me, and I will answer him.  I will be with him
        in trouble.  I will deliver him, and honor him.
091:016 I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation."
092:001 <<A Psalm.  A song for the Sabbath day.>> It is a good thing
        to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;
092:002 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your
        faithfulness every night,
092:003 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody
        of the lyre.
092:004 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work.
        I will triumph in the works of your hands.
092:005 How great are your works, Yahweh!  Your thoughts are very deep.
092:006 A senseless man doesn't know, neither does a fool understand this:
092:007 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evil-doers
        flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
092:008 But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.
092:009 For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies
        shall perish.  All the evil-doers will be scattered.
092:010 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.
        I am anointed with fresh oil.
092:011 My eye has also seen my enemies.  My ears have heard of the wicked
        enemies who rise up against me.
092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.
        He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
092:013 They are planted in Yahweh's house.  They will flourish
        in our God's courts.
092:014 They will still bring forth fruit in old age.  They will be
        full of sap and green,
092:015 to show that Yahweh is upright.  He is my rock, and there
        is no unrighteousness in him.
093:001 Yahweh reigns!  He is clothed with majesty!  Yahweh is
        armed with strength.  The world also is established.
        It can't be moved.
093:002 Your throne is established from long ago.  You are from everlasting.
093:003 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up
        their voice.  The floods lift up their waves.
093:004 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea,
        Yahweh on high is mighty.
093:005 Your statutes stand firm.  Holiness adorns your house,
        Yahweh, forevermore.
094:001 Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom
        vengeance belongs, shine forth.
094:002 Rise up, you judge of the earth.  Pay back the proud
        what they deserve.
094:003 Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
094:004 They pour out arrogant words.  All the evil-doers boast.
094:005 They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.
094:006 They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
094:007 They say, "Yah will not see, neither will Jacob's God consider."
094:008 Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools,
        when will you be wise?
094:009 He who implanted the ear, won't he hear?  He who formed the eye,
        won't he see?
094:010 He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish?
        He who teaches man knows.
094:011 Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
094:012 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out
        of your law;
094:013 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,
        until the pit is dug for the wicked.
094:014 For Yahweh won't reject his people, neither will he
        forsake his inheritance.
094:015 For judgment will return to righteousness.  All the upright
        in heart shall follow it.
094:016 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand
        up for me against the evil-doers?
094:017 Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon
        lived in silence.
094:018 When I said, "My foot is slipping!"  Your loving kindness,
        Yahweh, held me up.
094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts
        delight my soul.
094:020 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,
        which brings about mischief by statute?
094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
        and condemn the innocent blood.
094:022 But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.
094:023 He has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off
        in their own wickedness.  Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
095:001 Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh.  Let's shout aloud to the rock
        of our salvation!
095:002 Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving.
        Let's extol him with songs!
095:003 For Yahweh is a great God, a great King above all gods.
095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth.  The heights
        of the mountains are also his.
095:005 The sea is his, and he made it.  His hands formed the dry land.
095:006 Oh come, let's worship and bow down.  Let's kneel
        before Yahweh, our Maker,
095:007 for he is our God.  We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
        in his care.  Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
095:008 Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah
        in the wilderness,
095:009 when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.
095:010 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,
        and said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.
        They have not known my ways."
095:011 Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They won't enter into my rest."
096:001 Sing to Yahweh a new song!  Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
096:002 Sing to Yahweh!  Bless his name!  Proclaim his salvation
        from day to day!
096:003 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among
        all the peoples.
096:004 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
        He is to be feared above all gods.
096:005 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh
        made the heavens.
096:006 Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and beauty are
        in his sanctuary.
096:007 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh
        glory and strength.
096:008 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering,
        and come into his courts.
096:009 Worship Yahweh in holy array.  Tremble before him, all the earth.
096:010 Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."  The world is
        also established.  It can't be moved.  He will judge
        the peoples with equity.
096:011 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.
        Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
096:012 Let the field and all that is in it exult!  Then all the trees
        of the woods shall sing for joy
096:013 before Yahweh; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth.
        He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples
        with his truth.
097:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the earth rejoice!  Let the multitude
        of islands be glad!
097:002 Clouds and darkness are around him.  Righteousness and justice
        are the foundation of his throne.
097:003 A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side.
097:004 His lightning lights up the world.  The earth sees, and trembles.
097:005 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh,
        at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness.  All the peoples have
        seen his glory.
097:007 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast
        in their idols.  Worship him, all you gods!
097:008 Zion heard and was glad.  The daughters of Judah rejoiced,
        because of your judgments, Yahweh.
097:009 For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth.
        You are exalted far above all gods.
097:010 You who love Yahweh, hate evil.  He preserves the souls of
        his saints.  He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
        upright in heart.
097:012 Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people!  Give thanks to
        his holy Name.
098:001 <<A Psalm.>> Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done
        marvelous things!  His right hand, and his holy arm,
        have worked salvation for him.
098:002 Yahweh has made known his salvation.  He has openly shown
        his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
098:003 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness
        toward the house of Israel.  All the ends of the earth have
        seen the salvation of our God.
098:004 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth!  Burst out and sing
        for joy, yes, sing praises!
098:005 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and
        the voice of melody.
098:006 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn, make a joyful noise
        before the King, Yahweh.
098:007 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those
        who dwell therein.
098:008 Let the rivers clap their hands.  Let the mountains sing
        for joy together.
098:009 Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.
        He will judge the world with righteousness, and the
        peoples with equity.
099:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the peoples tremble.  He sits enthroned
        among the cherubim.  Let the earth be moved.
099:002 Yahweh is great in Zion.  He is high above all the peoples.
099:003 Let them praise your great and awesome name.  He is Holy!
099:004 The King's strength also loves justice.  You do establish equity.
        You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
099:005 Exalt Yahweh our God.  Worship at his footstool.
        He is Holy!
099:006 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who call
        on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he answered them.
099:007 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.  They kept his testimonies,
        the statute that he gave them.
099:008 You answered them, Yahweh our God.  You are a God who forgave them,
        although you took vengeance for their doings.
099:009 Exalt Yahweh, our God.  Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh,
        our God, is holy!
100:001 <<A Psalm of thanksgiving.>> Shout for joy to Yahweh,
        all you lands!
100:002 Serve Yahweh with gladness.  Come before his presence with singing.
100:003 Know that Yahweh, he is God.  It is he who has made us, and we
        are his.  We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise.
        Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
100:005 For Yahweh is good.  His loving kindness endures forever,
        his faithfulness to all generations.
101:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> I will sing of loving kindness and justice.
        To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
101:002 I will be careful to live a blameless life.  When will you come
        to me?  I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
101:003 I will set no vile thing before my eyes.  I hate the deeds
        of faithless men.  They will not cling to me.
101:004 A perverse heart will be far from me.  I will have nothing
        to do with evil.
101:005 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.
        I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
101:006 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
        with me.  He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
101:007 He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house.
        He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes.
101:008 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land;
        to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.
102:001 <<A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out
        his complaint before Yahweh.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh!  Let my
        cry come to you.
102:002 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress.
        Turn your ear to me.  Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
102:003 For my days consume away like smoke.  My bones are burned
        as a firebrand.
102:004 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget
        to eat my bread.
102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness.  I have become as an owl
        of the waste places.
102:007 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone
        on the housetop.
102:008 My enemies reproach me all day.  Those who are mad at me use
        my name as a curse.
102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,
102:010 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken
        me up, and thrown me away.
102:011 My days are like a long shadow.  I have withered like grass.
102:012 But you, Yahweh, will abide forever; your renown endures
        to all generations.
102:013 You will arise and have mercy on Zion; for it is time to have
        pity on her.  Yes, the set time has come.
102:014 For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity
        on her dust.
102:015 So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; all the kings
        of the earth your glory.
102:016 For Yahweh has built up Zion.  He has appeared in his glory.
102:017 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not
        despised their prayer.
102:018 This will be written for the generation to come.
        A people which will be created will praise Yah.
102:019 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.
        From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;
102:020 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are
        condemned to death;
102:021 that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, and his
        praise in Jerusalem;
102:022 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms,
        to serve Yahweh.
102:023 He weakened my strength along the course.  He shortened my days.
102:024 I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days.
        Your years are throughout all generations.
102:025 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.  The heavens
        are the work of your hands.
102:026 They will perish, but you will endure.  Yes, all of them will
        wear out like a garment.  You will change them like a cloak,
        and they will be changed.
102:027 But you are the same.  Your years will have no end.
102:028 The children of your servants will continue.  Their seed
        will be established before you."
103:001 <<By David.>> Praise Yahweh, my soul!  All that is within me,
        praise his holy name!
103:002 Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't forget all his benefits;
103:003 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases;
103:004 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with
        loving kindness and tender mercies;
103:005 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth
        is renewed like the eagle's.
103:006 Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all
        who are oppressed.
103:007 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.
103:008 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant
        in loving kindness.
103:009 He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.
103:010 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us
        for our iniquities.
103:011 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his
        loving kindness toward those who fear him.
103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed
        our transgressions from us.
103:013 Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has
        compassion on those who fear him.
103:014 For he knows how we are made.  He remembers that we are dust.
103:015 As for man, his days are like grass.  As a flower of the field,
        so he flourishes.
103:016 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.  Its place
        remembers it no more.
103:017 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting
        with those who fear him, his righteousness to children's children;
103:018 to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to
        obey his precepts.
103:019 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens.
        His kingdom rules over all.
103:020 Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength,
        who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word.
103:021 Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his,
        who do his pleasure.
103:022 Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion.
        Praise Yahweh, my soul!
104:001 Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Yahweh, my God, you are very great.
        You are clothed with honor and majesty.
104:002 He covers himself with light as with a garment.
        He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
104:003 He lays the beams of his chambers in the waters.
        He makes the clouds his chariot.  He walks on the wings
        of the wind.
104:004 He makes his messengers{or, angels} winds; his servants
        flames of fire.
104:005 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not
        be moved forever.
104:006 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.  The waters
        stood above the mountains.
104:007 At your rebuke they fled.  At the voice of your thunder
        they hurried away.
104:008 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place
        which you had assigned to them.
104:009 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;
        that they don't turn again to cover the earth.
104:010 He sends forth springs into the valleys.  They run
        among the mountains.
104:011 They give drink to every animal of the field.  The wild donkeys
        quench their thirst.
104:012 The birds of the sky nest by them.  They sing among the branches.
104:013 He waters the mountains from his chambers.  The earth is filled
        with the fruit of your works.
104:014 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man
        to cultivate, that he may bring forth food out of the earth:
104:015 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face
        to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.
104:016 Yahweh's trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon,
        which he has planted;
104:017 where the birds make their nests.  The stork makes its home
        in the fir trees.
104:018 The high mountains are for the wild goats.  The rocks are
        a refuge for the rock badgers.
104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons.  The sun knows when to set.
104:020 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals
        of the forest prowl.
104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their
        food from God.
104:022 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
104:023 Man goes forth to his work, to his labor until the evening.
104:024 Yahweh, how many are your works!  In wisdom have you made them all.
        The earth is full of your riches.
104:025 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable
        living things, both small and large animals.
104:026 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
104:027 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food
        in due season.
104:028 You give to them; they gather.  You open your hand;
        they are satisfied with good.
104:029 You hide your face:  they are troubled; you take away their breath:
        they die, and return to the dust.
104:030 You send forth your Spirit:  they are created.  You renew
        the face of the ground.
104:031 Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.  Let Yahweh rejoice
        in his works.
104:032 He looks at the earth, and it trembles.  He touches the mountains,
        and they smoke.
104:033 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.  I will sing praise
        to my God while I have any being.
104:034 Let your meditation be sweet to him.  I will rejoice in Yahweh.
104:035 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.  Let the wicked be no more.
        Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Praise Yah!
105:001 Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name!  Make his doings
        known among the peoples.
105:002 Sing to him, sing praises to him!  Tell of all his marvelous works.
105:003 Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who
        seek Yahweh rejoice.
105:004 Seek Yahweh and his strength.  Seek his face forever more.
105:005 Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth,
105:006 you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob,
        his chosen ones.
105:007 He is Yahweh, our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
105:008 He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded
        to a thousand generations,
105:009 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,
105:010 and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,
105:011 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot
        of your inheritance;"
105:012 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few,
        and foreigners in it.
105:013 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom
        to another people.
105:014 He allowed no one to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,
105:015 "Don't touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm!"
105:016 He called for a famine on the land.  He destroyed the food supplies.
105:017 He sent a man before them.  Joseph was sold for a slave.
105:018 They bruised his feet with shackles.  His neck was locked in irons,
105:019 until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh's word
        proved him true.
105:020 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples,
        and let him go free.
105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;
105:022 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach
        his elders wisdom.
105:023 Israel also came into Egypt.  Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:024 He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger
        than their adversaries.
105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire
        against his servants.
105:026 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
105:027 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark.  They didn't rebel
        against his words.
105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
105:030 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
105:031 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
105:032 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
105:033 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered
        the trees of their country.
105:034 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
105:035 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit
        of their ground.
105:036 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits
        of all their manhood.
105:037 He brought them forth with silver and gold.  There was not
        one feeble person among his tribes.
105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had
        fallen on them.
105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
105:040 They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with
        the bread of the sky.
105:041 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.  They ran as a river
        in the dry places.
105:042 For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.
105:043 He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.
105:044 He gave them the lands of the nations.  They took the labor
        of the peoples in possession,
105:045 that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws.
        Praise Yah!
106:001 Praise Yahweh!  Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
        for his loving kindness endures forever.
106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare
        all his praise?
106:003 Blessed are those who keep justice.  Blessed is one who does
        what is right at all times.
106:004 Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.
        Visit me with your salvation,
106:005 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may
        rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory
        with your inheritance.
106:006 We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity.
        We have done wickedly.
106:007 Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't
        remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were
        rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
        make his mighty power known.
106:009 He rebuked the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up;
        so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
106:010 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed
        them from the hand of the enemy.
106:011 The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one
        of them left.
106:012 Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.
106:013 They soon forgot his works.  They didn't wait for his counsel,
106:014 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God
        in the wasteland.
106:015 He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered
        the company of Abiram.
106:018 A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned
        up the wicked.
106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
106:020 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull
        that eats grass.
106:021 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by
        the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses,
        his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away
        his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.
106:024 Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,
106:025 but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
106:026 Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them
        in the wilderness,
106:027 that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
        and scatter them in the lands.
106:028 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices
        of the dead.
106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.
        The plague broke in on them.
106:030 Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the
        plague was stopped.
106:031 That was credited to him for righteousness, for all
        generations to come.
106:032 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses
        was troubled for their sakes;
106:033 because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke
        rashly with his lips.
106:034 They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
106:035 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
106:036 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
106:037 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
106:038 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
        their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
        The land was polluted with blood.
106:039 Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted
        themselves in their deeds.
106:040 Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.
        He abhorred his inheritance.
106:041 He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated
        them ruled over them.
106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into
        subjection under their hand.
106:043 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious
        in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
106:045 He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
        to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
106:046 He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
106:047 Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations,
        to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!
106:048 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even
        to everlasting!  Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!
107:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
107:002 Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from
        the hand of the adversary,
107:003 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west,
        from the north and from the south.
107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
        They found no city to live in.
107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
107:006 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered
        them out of their distresses,
107:007 he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city
        to live in.
107:008 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:009 For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry
        soul with good.
107:010 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
        in affliction and iron,
107:011 because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned
        the counsel of the Most High.
107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.
        They fell down, and there was none to help.
107:013 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them
        out of their distresses.
107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
        and broke their bonds in sunder.
107:015 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:016 For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
107:017 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because
        of their iniquities.
107:018 Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to
        the gates of death.
107:019 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, he saves them out
        of their distresses.
107:020 He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them
        from their graves.
107:021 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:022 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare
        his works with singing.
107:023 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business
        in great waters;
107:024 These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.
107:025 For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts
        up its waves.
107:026 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
        Their soul melts away because of trouble.
107:027 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
        and are at their wits' end.
107:028 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them
        out of their distress.
107:029 He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
107:030 Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them
        to their desired haven.
107:031 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works for the children of men!
107:032 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
        and praise him in the seat of the elders.
107:033 He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
107:034 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness
        of those who dwell in it.
107:035 He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land
        into water springs.
107:036 There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city
        to live in,
107:037 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
107:038 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
        He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.
107:039 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression,
        trouble, and sorrow.
107:040 He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander
        in a trackless waste.
107:041 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases
        their families like a flock.
107:042 The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will
        shut their mouths.
107:043 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.
        They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.
108:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by David.>> My heart is steadfast, God.
        I will sing and I will make music with my soul.
108:002 Wake up, harp and lyre!  I will wake up the dawn.
108:003 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
        I will sing praises to you among the peoples.
108:004 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.
        Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
108:005 Be exalted, God, above the heavens!  Let your glory be over
        all the earth.
108:006 That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand,
        and answer us.
108:007 God has spoken from his sanctuary:  "In triumph, I will
        divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
108:008 Gilead is mine.  Manasseh is mine.  Ephraim also is my helmet.
        Judah is my scepter.
108:009 Moab is my wash pot.  I will toss my sandal on Edom.
        I will shout over Philistia."
108:010 Who will bring me into the fortified city?  Who has led
        me to Edom?
108:011 Haven't you rejected us, God?  You don't go forth, God,
        with our armies.
108:012 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.
108:013 Through God, we will do valiantly.  For it is he who will tread
        down our enemies.
109:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> God of my praise,
        don't remain silent,
109:002 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of
        deceit against me.  They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
109:003 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought
        against me without a cause.
109:004 In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I
        am in prayer.
109:005 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
109:006 Set a wicked man over him.  Let an adversary stand at
        his right hand.
109:007 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty.  Let his prayer
        be turned into sin.
109:008 Let his days be few.  Let another take his office.
109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
109:010 Let his children be wandering beggars.  Let them be sought
        from their ruins.
109:011 Let the creditor seize all that he has.  Let strangers plunder
        the fruit of his labor.
109:012 Let there be none to extend kindness to him, neither let there
        be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
109:013 Let his posterity be cut off.  In the generation following
        let their name be blotted out.
109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.
        Don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:015 Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off
        the memory of them from the earth;
109:016 because he didn't remember to show kindness, but persecuted
        the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.
109:017 Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.  He didn't delight
        in blessing, and it was far from him.
109:018 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.
        It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.
109:019 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,
        for the belt that is always around him.
109:020 This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those
        who speak evil against my soul.
109:021 But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name's sake,
        because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
109:022 for I am poor and needy.  My heart is wounded within me.
109:023 I fade away like an evening shadow.  I am shaken off like a locust.
109:024 My knees are weak through fasting.  My body is thin and lacks fat.
109:025 I have also become a reproach to them.  When they see me,
        they shake their head.
109:026 Help me, Yahweh, my God.  Save me according to your loving kindness;
109:027 that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh,
        have done it.
109:028 They may curse, but you bless.  When they arise, they will
        be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.
109:029 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.  Let them cover
        themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
109:030 I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.  Yes, I will
        praise him among the multitude.
109:031 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him
        from those who judge his soul.
110:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
        until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."
110:002 Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion.
        Rule in the midst of your enemies.
110:003 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power,
        in holy array.  Out of the womb of the morning, you have
        the dew of your youth.
110:004 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:
        "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
110:005 The Lord is at your right hand.  He will crush kings in the day
        of his wrath.
110:006 He will judge among the nations.  He will heap up dead bodies.
        He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
110:007 He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore he will lift
        up his head.
111:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 111 is an acrostic poem, with each verse
        after the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of
        the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).} I will give thanks
        to Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright,
        and in the congregation.
111:002 Yahweh's works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them.
111:003 His work is honor and majesty.  His righteousness endures forever.
111:004 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered.
        Yahweh is gracious and merciful.
111:005 He has given food to those who fear him.  He always
        remembers his covenant.
111:006 He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them
        the heritage of the nations.
111:007 The works of his hands are truth and justice.
        All his precepts are sure.
111:008 They are established forever and ever.  They are done in
        truth and uprightness.
111:009 He has sent redemption to his people.  He has ordained his
        covenant forever.  His name is holy and awesome!
111:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.
        All those who do his work have a good understanding.
        His praise endures forever!
112:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 112 is an acrostic poem, with each verse after
        the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of the alphabet
        (ordered from Alef to Tav).} Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh,
        who delights greatly in his commandments.
112:002 His seed will be mighty in the land.  The generation of the upright
        will be blessed.
112:003 Wealth and riches are in his house.  His righteousness
        endures forever.
112:004 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious,
        merciful, and righteous.
112:005 It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends.
        He will maintain his cause in judgment.
112:006 For he will never be shaken.  The righteous will
        be remembered forever.
112:007 He will not be afraid of evil news.  His heart is steadfast,
        trusting in Yahweh.
112:008 His heart is established.  He will not be afraid in the end
        when he sees his adversaries.
112:009 He has dispersed, he has given to the poor.  His righteousness
        endures forever.  His horn will be exalted with honor.
112:010 The wicked will see it, and be grieved.  He shall gnash with
        his teeth, and melt away.  The desire of the wicked will perish.
113:001 Praise Yah!  Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise the
        name of Yahweh.
113:002 Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
113:003 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same,
        Yahweh's name is to be praised.
113:004 Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
113:005 Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high,
113:006 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
113:007 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  Lifts up the needy
        from the ash heap;
113:008 that he may set him with princes, even with the princes
        of his people.
113:009 He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother
        of children.  Praise Yah!
114:001 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from
        a people of foreign language;
114:002 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
114:003 The sea saw it, and fled.  The Jordan was driven back.
114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
114:005 What was it, you sea, that you fled?  You Jordan,
        that you turned back?
114:006 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills,
        like lambs?
114:007 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence
        of the God of Jacob,
114:008 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into
        a spring of waters.
115:001 Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory,
        for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
115:002 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
115:003 But our God is in the heavens.  He does whatever he pleases.
115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
115:005 They have mouths, but they don't speak.  They have eyes,
        but they don't see.
115:006 They have ears, but they don't hear.  They have noses,
        but they don't smell.
115:007 They have hands, but they don't feel.  They have feet, but they
        don't walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
115:008 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who
        trusts in them.
115:009 Israel, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:010 House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:011 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help
        and their shield.
115:012 Yahweh remembers us.  He will bless us.  He will bless the house
        of Israel.  He will bless the house of Aaron.
115:013 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.
115:014 May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children.
115:015 Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
115:016 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; but the earth has
        he given to the children of men.
115:017 The dead don't praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence;
115:018 But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore.
        Praise Yah!
116:001 I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my
        cries for mercy.
116:002 Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call
        on him as long as I live.
116:003 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold
        of me.  I found trouble and sorrow.
116:004 Then called I on the name of Yahweh:  "Yahweh, I beg you,
        deliver my soul."
116:005 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
116:006 Yahweh preserves the simple.  I was brought low, and he saved me.
116:007 Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt
        bountifully with you.
116:008 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears,
        and my feet from falling.
116:009 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
116:010 I believed, therefore I said, "I was greatly afflicted."
116:011 I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
116:012 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh.
116:014 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of
        all his people.
116:015 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.
116:016 Yahweh, truly I am your servant.  I am your servant, the son
        of your handmaid.  You have freed me from my chains.
116:017 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
        call on the name of Yahweh.
116:018 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of
        all his people,
116:019 in the courts of Yahweh's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem.
        Praise Yah!
117:001 Praise Yahweh, all you nations!  Extol him, all you peoples!
117:002 For his loving kindness is great toward us.  Yahweh's faithfulness
        endures forever.  Praise Yah!
118:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
118:002 Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever.
118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness
        endures forever.
118:004 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving
        kindness endures forever.
118:005 Out of my distress, I called on Yah.  Yah answered me with freedom.
118:006 Yahweh is on my side.  I will not be afraid.  What can man
        do to me?
118:007 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me.  Therefore I
        will look in triumph at those who hate me.
118:008 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man.
118:009 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put
        confidence in princes.
118:010 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I
        cut them off.
118:011 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.  In the name
        of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.
118:012 They surrounded me like bees.  They are quenched like the
        burning thorns.  In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.
118:013 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.
118:014 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of
        the righteous.  "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!  The right hand of
        Yahweh does valiantly!"
118:017 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works.
118:018 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me
        over to death.
118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness.  I will enter into them.
        I will give thanks to Yah.
118:020 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.
118:021 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have
        become my salvation.
118:022 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head
        of the corner.
118:023 This is Yahweh's doing.  It is marvelous in our eyes.
118:024 This is the day that Yahweh has made.  We will rejoice and be
        glad in it!
118:025 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh!  Yahweh, we beg you,
        send prosperity now.
118:026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!  We have blessed
        you out of the house of Yahweh.
118:027 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.  Bind the sacrifice
        with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
118:028 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.
        You are my God, I will exalt you.
118:029 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
119:001 <<ALEPH>> Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,
        who walk according to Yahweh's law.
119:002 Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with
        their whole heart.
119:003 Yes, they do nothing wrong.  They walk in his ways.
119:004 You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them.
119:005 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes!
119:006 Then I wouldn't be disappointed, when I consider all
        of your commandments.
119:007 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I
        learn your righteous judgments.
119:008 I will observe your statutes.  Don't utterly forsake me.
119:009 How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according
        to your word.
119:010 With my whole heart, I have sought you.  Don't let me wander
        from your commandments.
119:011 I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not
        sin against you.
119:012 Blessed are you, Yahweh.  Teach me your statutes.
119:013 With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.
119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much
        as in all riches.
119:015 I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways.
119:016 I will delight myself in your statutes.  I will not
        forget your word.
119:017 Do good to your servant.  I will live and I will obey your word.
119:018 Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law.
119:019 I am a stranger on the earth.  Don't hide your commandments from me.
119:020 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
119:021 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander
        from your commandments.
119:022 Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have
        kept your statutes.
119:023 Though princes sit and slander me, your servant will meditate
        on your statutes.
119:024 Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors.
119:025 My soul is laid low in the dust.  Revive me according
        to your word!
119:026 I declared my ways, and you answered me.  Teach me your statutes.
119:027 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts!
        Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.
119:028 My soul is weary with sorrow:  strengthen me according
        to your word.
119:029 Keep me from the way of deceit.  Grant me your law graciously!
119:030 I have chosen the way of truth.  I have set your ordinances
        before me.
119:031 I cling to your statutes, Yahweh.  Don't let me be disappointed.
119:032 I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set
        my heart free.
119:033 Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your statutes.  I will keep them
        to the end.
119:034 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law.  Yes, I will
        obey it with my whole heart.
119:035 Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them.
119:036 Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain.
119:037 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things.
        Revive me in your ways.
119:038 Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared.
119:039 Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
119:040 Behold, I long for your precepts!  Revive me in your righteousness.
119:041 Let your loving kindness also come to me, Yahweh, your salvation,
        according to your word.
119:042 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I
        trust in your word.
119:043 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put
        my hope in your ordinances.
119:044 So I will obey your law continually, forever and ever.
119:045 I will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
119:046 I will also speak of your statutes before kings, and will
        not be disappointed.
119:047 I will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them.
119:048 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love.
        I will meditate on your statutes.
119:049 Remember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.
119:051 The arrogant mock me excessively, but I don't swerve from your law.
119:052 I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, and have comforted myself.
119:053 Indignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked
        who forsake your law.
119:054 Your statutes have been my songs, in the house where I live.
119:055 I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I
        obey your law.
119:056 This is my way, that I keep your precepts.
119:057 Yahweh is my portion.  I promised to obey your words.
119:058 I sought your favor with my whole heart.  Be merciful to me
        according to your word.
119:059 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes.
119:060 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments.
119:061 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law.
119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of
        your righteous ordinances.
119:063 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who
        observe your precepts.
119:064 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:065 Do good to your servant, according to your word, Yahweh.
119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe
        in your commandments.
119:067 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word.
119:068 You are good, and do good.  Teach me your statutes.
119:069 The proud have smeared a lie upon me.  With my whole heart,
        I will keep your precepts.
119:070 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law.
119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may
        learn your statutes.
119:072 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces
        of gold and silver.
119:073 Your hands have made me and formed me.  Give me understanding,
        that I may learn your commandments.
119:074 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put
        my hope in your word.
119:075 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in
        faithfulness you have afflicted me.
119:076 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to
        your word to your servant.
119:077 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;
        for your law is my delight.
119:078 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown
        me wrongfully.  I will meditate on your precepts.
119:079 Let those who fear you turn to me.  They will know your statutes.
119:080 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may
        not be disappointed.
119:081 My soul faints for your salvation.  I hope in your word.
119:082 My eyes fail for your word.  I say, "When will you comfort me?"
119:083 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.
        I don't forget your statutes.
119:084 How many are the days of your servant?  When will you execute
        judgment on those who persecute me?
119:085 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law.
119:086 All of your commandments are faithful.  They persecute
        me wrongfully.  Help me!
119:087 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't
        forsake your precepts.
119:088 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I
        will obey the statutes of your mouth.
119:089 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.
119:090 Your faithfulness is to all generations.  You have established
        the earth, and it remains.
119:091 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you.
119:092 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished
        in my affliction.
119:093 I will never forget your precepts, for with them,
        you have revived me.
119:094 I am yours.  Save me, for I have sought your precepts.
119:095 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.
        I will consider your statutes.
119:096 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands
        are boundless.
119:097 How I love your law!  It is my meditation all day.
119:098 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your
        commandments are always with me.
119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your
        testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts.
119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might
        observe your word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you
        have taught me.
119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey
        to my mouth!
119:104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate
        every false way.
119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey
        your righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.
119:108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.
        Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray
        from your precepts.
119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they
        are the joy of my heart.
119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,
        even to the end.
119:113 I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.
119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield.  I hope in your word.
119:115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments
        of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.
        Let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for
        your statutes continually.
119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their
        deceit is in vain.
119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.
        Therefore I love your testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you.  I am afraid of your judgments.
119:121 I have done what is just and righteous.  Don't leave me
        to my oppressors.
119:122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me.
119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word.
119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:125 I am your servant.  Give me understanding, that I may
        know your testimonies.
119:126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law.
119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes,
        more than pure gold.
119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.
        I hate every false way.
119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them.
119:130 The entrance of your words gives light.  It gives understanding
        to the simple.
119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed
        for your commandments.
119:132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those
        who love your name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word.  Don't let any iniquity
        have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe
        your precepts.
119:135 Make your face shine on your servant.  Teach me your statutes.
119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't
        observe your law.
119:137 You are righteous, Yahweh.  Your judgments are upright.
119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness.
        They are fully trustworthy.
119:139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words.
119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your
        servant loves them.
119:141 I am small and despised.  I don't forget your precepts.
119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.
        Your law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me.  Your commandments
        are my delight.
119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever.  Give me understanding,
        that I may live.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart.  Answer me, Yahweh!  I will
        keep your statutes.
119:146 I have called to you.  Save me!  I will obey your statutes.
119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help.  I put my hope in your words.
119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might
        meditate on your word.
119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.
        Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.
119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness.  They are far
        from your law.
119:151 You are near, Yahweh.  All your commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have
        founded them forever.
119:153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law.
119:154 Plead my cause, and redeem me!  Revive me according to your promise.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes.
119:156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.  Revive me according
        to your ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.  I haven't swerved
        from your testimonies.
119:158 I look at the faithless with loathing, because they don't
        observe your word.
119:159 Consider how I love your precepts.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to
        your loving kindness.
119:160 All of your words are truth.  Every one of your righteous
        ordinances endures forever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands
        in awe of your words.
119:162 I rejoice at your word, as one who finds great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood.  I love your law.
119:164 Seven times a day, I praise you, because of your
        righteous ordinances.
119:165 Those who love your law have great peace.  Nothing causes
        them to stumble.
119:166 I have hoped for your salvation, Yahweh.  I have
        done your commandments.
119:167 My soul has observed your testimonies.  I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my
        ways are before you.
119:169 Let my cry come before you, Yahweh.  Give me understanding
        according to your word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before you.  Deliver me according
        to your word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments
        are righteousness.
119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
119:174 I have longed for your salvation, Yahweh.  Your law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, that I may praise you.  Let your
        ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep.  Seek your servant,
        for I don't forget your commandments.
120:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.
        He answered me.
120:002 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
120:003 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
        you deceitful tongue?
120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
120:005 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among
        the tents of Kedar!
120:006 My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.
120:007 I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
121:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
        Where does my help come from?
121:002 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
121:003 He will not allow your foot to be moved.  He who keeps you
        will not slumber.
121:004 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:005 Yahweh is your keeper.  Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
121:006 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
121:007 Yahweh will keep you from all evil.  He will keep your soul.
121:008 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this
        time forth, and forevermore.
122:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> I was glad when they said to me,
        "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
122:002 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
122:003 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
122:004 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an
        ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
122:005 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones
        of David's house.
122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Those who love you will prosper.
122:007 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
122:008 For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say,
        "Peace be within you."
122:009 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
123:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit
        in the heavens.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
        as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
        look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
123:003 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have
        endured much contempt.
123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who
        are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
124:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> If it had not been Yahweh
        who was on our side, let Israel now say,
124:002 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us;
124:003 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath
        was kindled against us;
124:004 then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would
        have gone over our soul;
124:005 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
124:006 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare.
        The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
125:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,
        which can't be moved, but remains forever.
125:002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his
        people from this time forth and forevermore.
125:003 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment
        of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands
        to do evil.
125:004 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright
        in their hearts.
125:005 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
        Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.
        Peace be on Israel.
126:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> When Yahweh brought back those who returned
        to Zion, we were like those who dream.
126:002 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing.
        Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great
        things for them."
126:003 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.
126:004 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.
126:005 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
126:006 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly
        come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
127:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By Solomon.>> Unless Yahweh builds
        the house, they labor in vain who build it.  Unless Yahweh
        watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain.
127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,
        eating the bread of toil; for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
127:003 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.  The fruit of the womb
        is his reward.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.
127:005 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
        They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies
        in the gate.
128:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
        who walks in his ways.
128:002 For you will eat the labor of your hands.  You will be happy,
        and it will be well with you.
128:003 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost
        parts of your house; your children like olive plants,
        around your table.
128:004 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
128:005 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good
        of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
128:006 Yes, may you see your children's children.  Peace be upon Israel.
129:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Many times they have afflicted me
        from my youth up.  Let Israel now say,
129:002 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they
        have not prevailed against me.
129:003 The plowers plowed on my back.  They made their furrows long.
129:004 Yahweh is righteous.  He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
129:005 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those
        who hate Zion.
129:006 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers
        before it grows up;
129:007 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who
        binds sheaves, his bosom.
129:008 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you.
        We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
130:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Out of the depths I have cried
        to you, Yahweh.
130:002 Lord, hear my voice.  Let your ears be attentive to the voice
        of my petitions.
130:003 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
130:004 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
130:005 I wait for Yahweh.  My soul waits.  I hope in his word.
130:006 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning;
        more than watchmen for the morning.
130:007 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.
        With him is abundant redemption.
130:008 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
131:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty,
        nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters,
        or things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child
        with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:003 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
132:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
132:002 how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,
        nor go up into my bed;
132:004 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
132:005 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the
        Mighty One of Jacob."
132:006 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.  We found it in the
        field of Jaar:
132:007 "We will go into his dwelling place.  We will worship
        at his footstool.
132:008 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark
        of your strength.
132:009 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.  Let your saints
        shout for joy!"
132:010 For your servant David's sake, don't turn away the face
        of your anointed one.
132:011 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.  He will not turn from it:
        "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
132:012 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony
        that I will teach them, their children also will sit on
        your throne forevermore."
132:013 For Yahweh has chosen Zion.  He has desired it for his habitation.
132:014 "This is my resting place forever.  Here I will live, for I
        have desired it.
132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision.  I will satisfy her
        poor with bread.
132:016 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.  Her saints
        will shout aloud for joy.
132:017 There I will make the horn of David to bud.  I have ordained
        a lamp for my anointed.
132:018 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself,
        his crown will be resplendent."
133:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> See how good and how pleasant
        it is for brothers to live together in unity!
133:002 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard,
        even Aaron's beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
133:003 like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion:
        for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forevermore.
134:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Look!  Praise Yahweh, all you servants
        of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!
134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.  Praise Yahweh!
134:003 May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even he who made heaven and earth.
135:001 Praise Yah!  Praise the name of Yahweh!  Praise him,
        you servants of Yahweh,
135:002 you who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of
        our God's house.
135:003 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.  Sing praises to his name,
        for that is pleasant.
135:004 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel for his own possession.
135:005 For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth,
        in the seas and in all deeps;
135:007 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;
        who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries;
135:008 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal;
135:009 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh,
        and on all his servants;
135:010 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all
        the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:012 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.
135:013 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh,
        throughout all generations.
135:014 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work
        of men's hands.
135:016 They have mouths, but they can't speak.  They have eyes,
        but they can't see.
135:017 They have ears, but they can't hear; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.
135:018 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who
        trusts in them.
135:019 House of Israel, praise Yahweh!  House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
135:020 House of Levi, praise Yahweh!  You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
135:021 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem.
        Praise Yah!
136:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:002 Give thanks to the God of gods; for his loving kindness
        endures forever.
136:003 Give thanks to the Lord of lords; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:004 To him who alone does great wonders; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:005 To him who by understanding made the heavens; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:006 To him who spread out the earth above the waters; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:007 To him who made the great lights; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:008 The sun to rule by day; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:010 To him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:011 And brought out Israel from among them; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:012 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:013 To him who divided the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} apart;
        for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds};
        for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:016 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:017 To him who struck great kings; for his loving kindness
        endures forever;
136:018 And killed mighty kings; for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:020 Og king of Bashan; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:021 And gave their land as an inheritance; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:022 Even a heritage to Israel his servant; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:024 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:025 Who gives food to every creature; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:026 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  Yes, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.
137:002 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps.
137:003 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
        Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:  "Sing us one
        of the songs of Zion!"
137:004 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land?
137:005 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
137:006 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you;
        if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem;
        who said, "Raze it!  Raze it even to its foundation!"
137:008 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy
        who rewards you, as you have served us.
137:009 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones
        against the rock.
138:001 <<By David.>> I will give you thanks with my whole heart.
        Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
138:002 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks
        to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;
        for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
138:003 In the day that I called, you answered me.  You encouraged me
        with strength in my soul.
138:004 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they
        have heard the words of your mouth.
138:005 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for great
        is Yahweh's glory.
138:006 For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;
        but the proud, he knows from afar.
138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.
        You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.
        Your right hand will save me.
138:008 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving
        kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.  Don't forsake the works
        of your own hands.
139:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,
        you have searched me, and you know me.
139:002 You know my sitting down and my rising up.  You perceive
        my thoughts from afar.
139:003 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted
        with all my ways.
139:004 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh,
        you know it altogether.
139:005 You hem me in behind and before.  You laid your hand on me.
139:006 This knowledge is beyond me.  It's lofty.  I can't attain it.
139:007 Where could I go from your Spirit?  Or where could I flee
        from your presence?
139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.  If I make my bed
        in Sheol, behold, you are there!
139:009 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;
139:010 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand
        will hold me.
139:011 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light
        around me will be night;"
139:012 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines
        as the day.  The darkness is like light to you.
139:013 For you formed my inmost being.  You knit me together in
        my mother's womb.
139:014 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
        Your works are wonderful.  My soul knows that very well.
139:015 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret,
        woven together in the depths of the earth.
139:016 Your eyes saw my body.  In your book they were all written,
        the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were
        none of them.
139:017 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!  How vast is
        the sum of them!
139:018 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.
        When I wake up, I am still with you.
139:019 If only you, God, would kill the wicked.  Get away from me,
        you bloodthirsty men!
139:020 For they speak against you wickedly.  Your enemies take your
        name in vain.
139:021 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you?  Am I not grieved
        with those who rise up against you?
139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred.  They have become my enemies.
139:023 Search me, God, and know my heart.  Try me, and know my thoughts.
139:024 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in
        the everlasting way.
140:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Deliver me,
        Yahweh, from the evil man.  Preserve me from the violent man;
140:002 those who devise mischief in their hearts.  They continually
        gather themselves together for war.
140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.
        Viper's poison is under their lips.  Selah.
140:004 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.  Preserve me
        from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
140:005 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords
        of a net by the path.  They have set traps for me.  Selah.
140:006 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."  Listen to the cry
        of my petitions, Yahweh.
140:007 Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered
        my head in the day of battle.
140:008 Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the wicked.  Don't let
        their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.  Selah.
140:009 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief
        of their own lips cover them.
140:010 Let burning coals fall on them.  Let them be thrown into the fire,
        into miry pits, from where they never rise.
140:011 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth.
        Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:012 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and justice for the needy.
140:013 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.
        The upright will dwell in your presence.
141:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, I have called on you.
        Come to me quickly!  Listen to my voice when I call to you.
141:002 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up
        of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
141:003 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.  Keep the door of my lips.
141:004 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds
        of wickedness with men who work iniquity.  Don't let me eat
        of their delicacies.
141:005 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me,
        it is like oil on the head; don't let my head refuse it;
        Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
141:006 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.
        They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
141:007 "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are
        scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
141:008 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.  In you, I take refuge.
        Don't leave my soul destitute.
141:009 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
        from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
141:010 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.
142:001 <<A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave.
        A Prayer.>> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.  With my voice,
        I ask Yahweh for mercy.
142:002 I pour out my complaint before him.  I tell him my troubles.
142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path.
        In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
142:004 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned
        for me.  Refuge has fled from me.  No one cares for my soul.
142:005 I cried to you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my refuge, my portion
        in the land of the living."
142:006 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.  deliver me
        from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name.
        The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
143:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh.  Listen to
        my petitions.  In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
143:002 Don't enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight
        no man living is righteous.
143:003 For the enemy pursues my soul.  He has struck my life
        down to the ground.  He has made me live in dark places,
        as those who have been long dead.
143:004 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.  My heart within
        me is desolate.
143:005 I remember the days of old.  I meditate on all your doings.
        I contemplate the work of your hands.
143:006 I spread forth my hands to you.  My soul thirsts for you,
        like a parched land.  Selah.
143:007 Hurry to answer me, Yahweh.  My spirit fails.  Don't hide
        your face from me, so that I don't become like those who go
        down into the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I
        trust in you.  Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,
        for I lift up my soul to you.
143:009 Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies.  I flee to you to hide me.
143:010 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.  Your Spirit is good.
        Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:011 Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's sake.  In your righteousness,
        bring my soul out of trouble.
143:012 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all
        those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.
144:001 <<By David.>> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands
        to war, and my fingers to battle:
144:002 my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer,
        my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who subdues my
        people under me.
144:003 Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him?  Or the son of man,
        that you think of him?
144:004 Man is like a breath.  His days are like a shadow that passes away.
144:005 Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down.  Touch the mountains,
        and they will smoke.
144:006 Throw out lightning, and scatter them.  Send out your arrows,
        and rout them.
144:007 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me
        out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
144:008 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:009 I will sing a new song to you, God.  On a ten-stringed lyre,
        I will sing praises to you.
144:010 You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David,
        his servant, from the deadly sword.
144:011 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,
        whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:012 Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters
        like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
144:013 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision.
        Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
144:014 Our oxen will pull heavy loads.  There is no breaking in,
        and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
144:015 Happy are the people who are in such a situation.
        Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.  {}
145:001 <<A praise psalm by David.This is an acrostic psalm,
        with every verse (including the second half of verse 13)
        starting with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.>>
        I will exalt you, my God, the King.  I will praise your name
        forever and ever.
145:002 Every day I will praise you.  I will extol your name
        forever and ever.
145:003 Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
        His greatness is unsearchable.
145:004 One generation will commend your works to another, and will
        declare your mighty acts.
145:005 Of the glorious majesty of your honor, of your wondrous works,
        I will meditate.
145:006 Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts.
        I will declare your greatness.
145:007 They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will
        sing of your righteousness.
145:008 Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of
        great loving kindness.
145:009 Yahweh is good to all.  His tender mercies are over all his works.
145:010 All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh.  Your saints
        will extol you.
145:011 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk
        about your power;
145:012 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory
        of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.  Your dominion endures
        throughout all generations.  Yahweh is faithful in all his words,
        and loving in all his deeds.{Some manuscripts omit these
        last two lines.}
145:014 Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who
        are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all wait for you.  You give them their food
        in due season.
145:016 You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
145:017 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
145:018 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call
        on him in truth.
145:019 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.
        He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
145:020 Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but all the wicked
        he will destroy.
145:021 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh.  Let all flesh bless
        his holy name forever and ever.
146:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh, my soul.
146:002 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.  I will sing praises
        to my God as long as I exist.
146:003 Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom
        there is no help.
146:004 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.
        In that very day, his thoughts perish.
146:005 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
        is in Yahweh, his God:
146:006 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
        who keeps truth forever;
146:007 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry.
        Yahweh frees the prisoners.
146:008 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.  Yahweh raises up those
        who are bowed down.  Yahweh loves the righteous.
146:009 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.  He upholds the fatherless
        and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
146:010 Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations.
        Praise Yah!
147:001 Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God;
        for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.
147:002 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem.  He gathers together the
        outcasts of Israel.
147:003 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
147:004 He counts the number of the stars.  He calls them all
        by their names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.  His understanding
        is infinite.
147:006 Yahweh upholds the humble.  He brings the wicked down
        to the ground.
147:007 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving.  Sing praises on the harp
        to our God,
147:008 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth,
        who makes grass grow on the mountains.
147:009 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens
        when they call.
147:010 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse.
        He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:011 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope
        in his loving kindness.
147:012 Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem!  Praise your God, Zion!
147:013 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.
        He has blessed your children within you.
147:014 He makes peace in your borders.  He fills you with the finest
        of the wheat.
147:015 He sends out his commandment to the earth.  His word
        runs very swiftly.
147:016 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.
147:017 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.  Who can stand before his cold?
147:018 He sends out his word, and melts them.  He causes his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.
147:019 He shows his word to Jacob; his statutes and his ordinances
        to Israel.
147:020 He has not done this for just any nation.  They don't know
        his ordinances.  Praise Yah!
148:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh from the heavens!  Praise him
        in the heights!
148:002 Praise him, all his angels!  Praise him, all his army!
148:003 Praise him, sun and moon!  Praise him, all you shining stars!
148:004 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are
        above the heavens.
148:005 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For he commanded,
        and they were created.
148:006 He has also established them forever and ever.  He has made
        a decree which will not pass away.
148:007 Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures,
        and all depths!
148:008 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind,
        fulfilling his word;
148:009 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars;
148:010 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds;
148:011 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges
        of the earth;
148:012 both young men and maidens; old men and children:
148:013 let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is exalted.
        His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
148:014 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all
        his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near
        to him.  Praise Yah!
149:001 Praise Yahweh!  Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in
        the assembly of the saints.
149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.  Let the children
        of Zion be joyful in their King.
149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance!  Let them sing praises
        to him with tambourine and harp!
149:004 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.  He crowns
        the humble with salvation.
149:005 Let the saints rejoice in honor.  Let them sing for joy
        on their beds.
149:006 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;
149:007 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with
        fetters of iron;
149:009 to execute on them the written judgment.  All his saints
        have this honor.  Praise Yah!
150:001 Praise Yah!  Praise God in his sanctuary!  Praise him in his
        heavens for his acts of power!
150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts!  Praise him according to
        his excellent greatness!
150:003 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet!  Praise him
        with harp and lyre!
150:004 Praise him with tambourine and dancing!  Praise him with stringed
        instruments and flute!
150:005 Praise him with loud cymbals!  Praise him with resounding cymbals!
150:006 Let everything that has breath praise Yah!  Praise Yah!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
